"Billionaires Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson and other high-profile entrepreneurs have pledged to spark a “new economic revolution” based around clean energy after launching a new investment drive for renewables. The Breakthrough Energy Coalition, made up of more than 25 investors from 10 countries, launched in Paris on Monday as part of the UN talks where nations are thrashing out an agreement to finally confront the issue of runaway climate change.  The group will mainly invest in early-stage clean energy companies across a range of sectors, such as electricity generation and storage, transportation and agriculture. The initiative has been announced in conjunction with Mission Innovation – an effort from 21 governments, including the US, Britain, Australia, Germany, China and Brazil, to double the amount of public money going into clean energy innovation.  It’s expected this will bolster governmental assistance in renewables such as solar to wind energy to $20bn. The Breakthrough Energy Coalition includes Microsoft co-founder Gates, Facebook co-founder and chief executive Zuckerberg and Virgin Group head Branson. Other investors include Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.  Gates said the world will be using 50% more energy by the middle of this century than it does today, which should benefit the world’s poor by is problematic because most of this energy will be derived from fossil fuels such as coal and oil.  “The renewable technologies we have today, like wind and solar, have made a lot of progress and could be one path to a zero-carbon energy future,” he said. “But given the scale of the challenge, we need to be exploring many different paths – and that means we also need to invent new approaches. Private companies will ultimately develop these energy breakthroughs, but their work will rely on the kind of basic research that only governments can fund. Both have a role to play.”  Zuckerberg said current progress towards sustainable energy is “too slow” while Branson added: “We must produce an abundance of clean, renewable energy and drive further innovation to make the next generation of energy more efficient. It will benefit the environment, our society and the economy.” Hoffman said efforts to transform energy sources have struggled because they require collaboration between private and public sectors.  “The swords that cut this Gordian knot: breakthrough technologies built and deployed by entrepreneurial companies with global scope,” he said. “Making the right investments in the right innovations now is essential to solving this energy challenge for current and future generations across the planet.”  The group hasn’t put a dollar figure on its level of investment, but said it will be focusing its resources on government-funded innovation that comes from countries signed up to the Mission Innovation initiative.  Global investment in clean energy increased to $270bn last year, the first significant increase after a three-year lull in investment. China led the way with $89bn in new money for renewables, followed by the US at $51bn. The tumbling costs of renewables – solar, for example, has dropped in price by 70% since 2009 – has helped bolster installation but experts have warned that dependency upon fossil fuels will need to be wound back more quickly if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change fueled by greenhouse gases. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change, most of the world’s electricity can – and must – be produced by low-carbon sources by 2050. The panel said that renewables needed to grow from a 30% share today to 80% of power generation by 2050, with fossil fuel energy without carbon capture and storage technology phased out by 2100. Michael Brune, executive director of environment group the Sierra Club, said clean energy was already “winning the fight” against fossil fuels.  “Now, these incredible public and private commitments, which are historic, essential, and timely, show that the nations of the world – as well as many of the world’s leading visionaries and philanthropists – are committed to making clean energy even more widespread, even faster,” he said.  “What’s now clearer than ever that our future will be 100% clean energy, and that dirty fossil fuels are merely riding out their final wave.”"

"France’s top diplomat Laurent Fabius, presiding over 195-nation talks for a UN climate pact, urged negotiators on Wednesday to pick up the pace so as to finish the job by 11 December. “My message is clear: we must accelerate the process because there is still a lot of work to do,” he told journalists on the sidelines of the UN conference in Paris’ northern outskirts.  “Options for compromise need to be found as quickly as possible,” he added.  “Heads of state and government on Monday gave us an unambiguous mandate, and we must succeed.” Since a high-profile opening by more than 150 world leaders on Monday, bureaucrats have been poring over a draft of the first pact to propose a global roster of carbon-curbing undertakings. The goal is to limit warming to 2C over pre-Industrial Revolution levels. The marathon conference is scheduled to close at 6pm on 11 December – but the process is notorious for textual bickering and running over schedule. Bureaucrats have been given an interim deadline of midday this Saturday to produce a blueprint, which will then be given to environment ministers to make the political decisions required for a deal. A European negotiator earlier told AFP there was “growing frustration” with what he described as a “very slow” pace of work. And Greenpeace campaigner Li Shuo, who has observer status in the talks, described the process as “quite messy”, with negotiations in “contact groups, spinoff groups, informal informals, huddles”. “At some point, we definitely need to switch gear,” he said. UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, cautioned against despair. “The text of the agreement will go through ups and downs, there will be many commas inserted and commas removed because that is the nature of this. It is a legally binding text and needs to be reviewed very, very carefully,” she said."

"Quel est l’objectif de ce sommet ? Trouver un nouvel accord mondial sur la réduction des émissions de dioxyde de carbone après 2020 et sur le financement de l’aide accordée aux pays pauvres dans le cadre de la lutte contre le changement climatique.  Où et quand a-t-il lieu ? Au Bourget, dans la banlieue nord-est de Paris, du 30 novembre au 11 décembre. Qui y participe ? 195 États seront représentés, notamment par 138 chefs d’État et de gouvernement dont les présidents américain Barack Obama et chinois Xi Jinping, et les Premiers ministres indien Narendra Modi et britannique David Cameron. Ces dirigeants ne seront présents qu’au début du sommet. Est-ce qu’il aura une influence sur ma vie quotidienne ? Oui, mais pas immédiatement. Les décisions de long terme que les gouvernements et les entreprises vont prendre en raison de l’accord de Paris affecteront aussi bien les centrales qui nous fournissent de l’énergie à la nourriture que nous mangeons en passant par la probabilité que nos maisons seront inondées ou seront touchées par des conditions météorologiques extrêmes à l’avenir. Il n’y a pas encore d’accord sur le climat ? Le protocole de Kyoto, le seul traité climatique contraignant, ne concernait à l’origine que les pays développés et ne concerne que l’UE, l’Australie et une poignée d’autres pays qui devront réduire leurs émissions d’ici 2020. Il y a également une déclaration non-contraignante séparée relative aux réductions volontaires de nombreux pays, riches et pauvres, au même horizon. Quel a été l’impact des attentats terroristes ? Les autorités françaises ont assuré que le sommet était maintenu mais la sécurité a été renforcée. Certains observateurs estiment que ces attaques pourraient renforcer le sentiment d’urgence et le besoin de solidarité. Les manifestations prévues en parallèle, comme la grande marche de Paris, n’auront pas lieu. Quelle est l’atmosphère ? Il y a de l’espoir et des mises en gardes. Le négociateur en chef chinois et le président du sommet précédent, qui s’est tenu à Lima, font partie de ceux qui affirment que la volonté politique pour un accord va enfin émerger. Mais… ? Il y a de nombreux points de friction potentiels. L’ambassadrice française chargée des négociations sur le changement climatique, Laurence Tubiana, s’attend à ce que la question du financement des pays pauvres soit la plus épineuse. Par ailleurs, les États-Unis et l’Union européenne ont différents points de vue sur ce qui devrait revêtir un caractère contraignant dans l’accord. Quels sont les camps représentés ? Les deux émetteurs principaux, la Chine et les USA veulent un accord à Paris – une différence de taille avec le dernier grand sommet climatique en 2009, lorsque la Chine était considérée comme étant de mauvaise foi. Le troisième plus grand émetteur, l’Inde pourrait jouer les trouble-fête. New Delhi a fait part, au cours de la réunion du G20, de son inquiétude par rapport à l’idée d’un mécanisme qui permettrait de revoir les objectifs tous les cinq ans. Sur quoi s’est-on mis d’accord jusque ici ? Plus de 170 pays – représentant 97% des émissions mondiales – ont soumis leurs engagements climatiques à l’ONU. Mais ces derniers ne suffiront qu’à limiter l’augmentation des températures mondiales à 2,7-3,3°C, d’après les analyses. Il s’agit d’un niveau largement supérieur au seuil de 2°C sur lequel s’étaient mis d’accord les dirigeants, c’est pourquoi de nombreux pays demandent la mise en place d’un mécanisme qui permettrait de revoir les objectifs tous les cinq ans.

Le sommet n’aura-t-il pas un impact carbone énorme ? L’ONU précise que la conférence va mener à des émissions de 21 000 tonnes équivalents carbone, peu ou prou le niveau de l’Estonie sur une année. Les organisateurs compensent ces émissions. Où puis-je m’informer pour en savoir plus sur le contexte de cette conférence ? Notre guide approfondi montre comment on en est arrivé là, au terme de deux décennies de négociations."

"A court in Paris has fined a woman €1,000 ($1,060) for refusing to have her fingerprints taken at a rally where clashes erupted between protesters and security forces ahead of a UN climate summit. The lawyer for the 25-year-old woman said legal proceedings against her “verged on the ridiculous”, pointing out that out of the hundreds arrested at the demonstration only two people had appeared before the court. Riot police fired teargas at far-left activists and arrested more than 300 people after a group of protesters pelted officers with bottles and candles taken from a tribute to the victims of the Paris attacks. The demonstrations disrupted a largely peaceful rally that saw thousands of people form a human chain across the French capital to urge world leaders to seal an ambitious pact to stop global warming. French police have banned demonstrations on Paris’ prestigious Champs Élysées avenue and near the venue for the conference at Le Bourget north of the capital during the two-week climate talks. The government introduced a state of emergency following a coordinated onslaught by gunmen and suicide bombers which killed 130 people in November, and parliament has given the green light to prolong the extraordinary set of security measures for three months. In a second fast-tracked case, a 28-year-old man was sentenced to three months in jail for throwing a glass bottle at a police officer, wounding his lip slightly, during the clashes in central Paris’s place de la République. The young man, who had been drinking, admitted he threw a metal can but said it was aimed at no one in particular. His lawyer argued he had not come to the square to fight, pointing out that he was dressed in brightly coloured clothes and carrying a rucksack in contrast to the black-clad, hooded protesters. The man and the woman were also found guilty of ignoring a police order to disperse, but both said they had not heard it. Prosecutors had called for harsher sentences for the pair. They suggested a five-month suspended sentence for the woman while the young man had faced eight months immediate imprisonment, four of which would form part of a suspended sentence.  Two others remain in custody while five more have been released."
"Greg Hunt says Australia is acting as a “broker” between competing country blocs on one of the most contentious issues in the Paris climate talks but has also clarified remarks that had the potential to damage the delicate negotiations. Hunt predicted there was no chance developing countries would achieve their aim of amending the purpose of the agreement from keeping global warming under 2 degrees to keeping it under 1.5 degrees.  One hundred and eight countries are demanding the lower goal on the basis of the latest climate science, including the low-lying island nations that met with the US president, Barack Obama, on Tuesday. Hunt said Australia was acting as a “shuttle” or “broker” on that issue, saying the concerns of those countries might be “referenced” in the final agreement but that inscribing it as a goal would be a “red line” for other nations and jeopardise the deal.  “We are acting as a broker in that space because you have some of the large developed economies and larger developing economies … we are acting as a broker in the middle of that triangle,” he said. He said Australia was flexible on the issue. “We know that some of the larger countries under no circumstances would accept 1.5 degrees as a goal so in a sense it is not Australia’s battle or fight, so we are trying to be constructive by providing a pathway but it clearly won’t end up as a formal goal of the text because then it will be vetoed by others,” he said. Asked about the issue of climate refugees from island states that could no longer support their populations under a 2 degrees warming scenario, Hunt said: “I think that is something we will deal with as a country when and if it arises.” He also moved quickly to clarify statements about the progress of the talks, which have got off to an “uneven” start, according to the Climate Institute’s Erwin Jackson. Previous climate talks, including the disastrous Copenhagen summit in 2009 and negotiations in the leadup to this conference in Paris, have suffered serious setbacks when the host country attempted to force acceptance of a cut-through negotiating text with imposed resolutions to some of the myriad disputed items. At a press conference, Hunt appeared to suggest this was exactly what the French government was proposing to do when it formally takes over running the talks from the professional negotiators. “There are of course numerous options the way the current text is constructed, in a sense the current text is somewhat diverting from where it is likely to be when the French produce a text as the basis for the final negotiations, most probably on Saturday, that text I understand does significantly narrow down the options,” he said. When asked whether the French text could produce the same kind of backlash seen at previous meetings Hunt agreed that had happened but said the negotiations over the coming week would “attempt … to resolve as many issues as possible, or to bring them down to the finest points of detail” adding “it has long been discussed, understood and embraced that the co-chairs text will evolve into a French text, which is being discussed with all parties as we speak”. The French presidency flatly denies it is working on any separate document, and Hunt said later he had only meant to refer to the efforts the French were making to help countries resolve their many points of difference within the current talks. “The key phrase I used was evolved … the French are helping parties outside the room knock out options, but there is no secret or separate French text,” he told Guardian Australia later. Hunt also released Australia’s plan to cope with already-locked-in climate change at the Paris summit – a compilation of existing efforts and policies including mapping Australia’s coastline to help state governments plan for future flooding, planning guidelines and CSIRO research for housing in areas subject to more intensive cyclones. The Abbott government defunded the Howard government’s $50m national climate change adaptation research facility before restoring $9m over three years. The lion’s share of that funding will go to the coastal mapping database. Jackson said there would not be “a good sense of progress this week for a day or so but it is fair to say that progress is uneven”. “This is being driven by certain regressive countries in the Like Minded Developing Country group (which includes China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia) attempting to suck energy out of the process and weaken the effectiveness of a possible agreement,” he said. “Saudi Arabia, a wealthy and diplomatically effective oil state, is the focus of much frustration.”"

"His idol is Subcomandante Marcos, the masked Mexican rebel; his weapon of choice a 1,000-watt vacuum cleaner. Meet Nut Brother, the Chinese activist-artist attempting to vanquish toxic smog by sucking it up through a black plastic nozzle..  As the latest coal-fuelled “airpocalypse” engulfed northern China this week and world leaders gathered in Paris to debate the fight against climate change, Nut Brother hit the streets of Beijing hoping to raise awareness of his country’s deadly smog crisis. For the last 100 days, the activist, whose real name is Wang Renzheng, has used the industrial appliance to extract dust and other lung-choking pollutants from the city’s atmosphere before transforming them into a dark brown “smog brick”. “I want to show this absurdity to more people,” Wang, 34, said on Tuesday as pollution levels in the Chinese capital soared to levels 40 times higher than those deemed safe by the World Health Organisation. “I want people to see that we cannot avoid or ignore this problem [and] that we must take real action.” Until the onset of this winter, Beijing’s 20 million long-suffering residents had expressed some optimism that things were on the up, after a comparatively smog-free 2015.   But the city’s latest “airmageddon” – to which the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, made no reference during his address to the UN climate summit in Paris on Monday – has underlined the scale of the challenge that remains. Despite government claims that “effective measures” had been taken to combat the hazardous smog, China’s capital has for days been coated by a putrid, nicotine-coloured haze.   PM2.5 levels hit 976 in Beijing suburbs https://t.co/0leyIqoPIY pic.twitter.com/2MyDn4GovD Beijing's stunning World Trade Centre #COP21 pic.twitter.com/Q0OOUZdax0 View outside the office window right now. If you look carefully you can see the building opposite mine #beijing #air pic.twitter.com/n5P8zMHcla “You can’t tell if it is night or day!” Liu Haishan, 38, a taxi driver, complained on Tuesday afternoon as he attempted to navigate through the gloom. Beijing authorities claimed they had forced vehicles off the roads and shut more than 2,000 polluting companies in order to tackle the crisis.  But environmentalists attacked the government for failing to declare a pollution “red alert”, despite the appalling conditions. “The shocking levels of air pollution we have seen in the last few days are a serious danger to the health of hundreds of millions of citizens,” said Dong Liansai, Greenpeace’s climate campaigner in China. “Moreover, the Beijing city government’s insufficient alerting system has compounded the problem.” Nut Brother said he began plotting his one-man anti-smog campaign in 2013 when a now infamous spell of pollution – dubbed China’s inaugural “airpocalypse” – saw flights grounded, motorways closed and hospitals packed with wheezing patients suffering from respiratory complaints. “It’s not healthy,” the artist said of the smog, which scientists blame for about 4,000 deaths a day in China, most caused by heart and lung problems and strokes. “You have nowhere to hide. It is in the air all around us.” Nut Brother, who was born in Hubei province and is based in the southern city of Shenzhen, began to execute his plan in July after convincing a restaurant owner to contribute 10,000 yuan (£1,000) to his pollution-themed performance art project. He ordered a vacuum cleaner from a manufacturer in Shanghai and began taking it on four-hour sorties across Beijing’s urban sprawl, gobbling up pollutants as he went. Photographs published in the Chinese media this week showed him pushing his vacuum cleaner past some of Beijing’s most celebrated landmarks. One image shows him sucking up dust outside Rem Koolhaas’s cloud-puncturing China Central Television headquarters; in another he is seen strolling past the portrait of Mao Zedong at the entrance to the Forbidden City.   Nut Brother said his attempts to suck up smog from Tiananmen Square – perhaps the most heavily guarded public space on earth – had triggered his only brush with the law. “They sent a plainclothes policeman to follow me but they didn’t impede my movements,” he recalled. Chinese websites and social networks were covered with reports of the artist’s quirky smog-harvesting campaign on Tuesday in Beijing. Reporters flocked to the artist’s temporary home – a 60-yuan-a-night youth hostel near the Lama Temple – to see his vacuum cleaner up close. “It is terrible today,” he complained of the latest bout of severe pollution, Beijing’s worst of the year. Despite grabbing headlines this week, China’s unconventional environmentalist remains a relative enigma. “I’m passionate about the environment but I don’t know if that qualifies me as an activist,” he said when asked how he defined himself. “I think I’m a normal person, just like anyone else.” In a 2012 interview with the Shenzhen Daily, Nut Brother said his “spiritual idol” was Subcomandante Marcos, the essay-writing, rifle-toting leader of Mexico’s Zapatista rebel group.     On Tuesday, the artist conceded it would take more than one vacuum cleaner to purify China’s skies. But he said he hoped to bring some of the Zapatista leader’s creativity to one of his homeland’s most pressing problems.  “[Subcomandante Marcos] used imaginative ways to change society,” Nut Brother said. “That is the path I want to follow.” Additional reporting by Christy Yao"

"World governments have been urged to tackle air pollution in poorer countries by greening cities, reducing traffic and adopting better diets, and told that this will also rein in climate change, which global health specialists estimate will cause at least 250,000 additional deaths a year by 2030. “It makes complete sense to tackle air pollution and climate change together,” said Maria Neira, director of the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) department of public health. “The solutions are the same. The major risk to health at the moment is air pollution. If we address this, the causes of air pollution will overlap and we will reduce climate change. It’s logical. It’s a win-win situation … The real costs of fossil fuels is seen in your lungs and your cardiovascular systems.”   The WHO has calculated that air pollution is one of the world’s biggest killers. It leads to the premature deaths of close to 7 million people annually, largely from heart disease and stroke, respiratory diseases and cancers. Most of the pollution deaths occur in developing countries, both in rural areas, where people burn wood to cook on, and increasingly in traffic-choked Asian and African cities where pollution is reaching catastrophic levels. In Britain, an estimated 50,000 people die prematurely of air pollution a year, mostly in urban areas. According to the WHO, many of the most harmful air pollutants also damage the climate. Known as short-lived climate pollutants, they include fine particles of black carbon, or soot, emitted from diesels and burning wood, and from ozone. They have major warming effects but remain only briefly in the atmosphere.  In a briefing this week at the Paris climate summit, public health professionals urged countries to tackle the two great global problems together. “If countries tackled these and other short-lived climate pollutants, they could not just clean the air, they would also save lives and slow climate change significantly,” said a spokesman for the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which is hosted by the UN environment programme and made up of the governments of Bangladesh, Ghana, Mexico, Canada, Sweden and the US. In a report, the coalition calculates that by adopting cleaner transport and other measures, countries could reduce air pollution deaths by 3.5 million a year and reduce global warming by about 20%, or 0.5C by 2030. “Reducing emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), which produce strong warming effects but persist in the atmosphere for periods ranging from days to decades, can provide health benefits in three key ways: directly from reduced air pollution and related ill-health; indirectly from reduced ozone and black carbon effects on extreme weather and agricultural production (affecting food security); and from other types of health benefits that are not associated with air pollution but may accrue as a result of certain SLCP mitigation actions, such as improved diets or increased physical activity,” the report said. In a 2014 study, the WHO looked at the effects of climate change on selected causes of deaths, and concluded that approximately 250,000 additional deaths would be due to climate change every year between 2030 and 2050. “Compared with a future without climate change, the following additional deaths are projected for the year 2030: 38,000 due to heat exposure in elderly people, 48,000 due to diarrhoea, 60,000 due to malaria, and 95,000 due to childhood undernutrition,” it said, noting that the total additional deaths did not represent a prediction of the overall impacts of climate change on health as they could not quantify several important causal pathways."

"Las oficinas de la Secretaría del Cambio Climático de la ONU en Bonn gozan de unas preciosas vistas sobre un tramo del Rin, hacia praderas y espléndidos edificios nuevos y antiguos. Se encuentran además a poca distancia del campus histórico que se hizo famoso por ser el lugar donde se firmó el Plan Marshall tras la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Dicho plan, que canalizó miles de millones de ayuda estadounidense para reconstruir las economías europeas, fue crucial para la creación de la Europa moderna y para redibujar la economía global. En lugar de las medidas punitivas y de las reparaciones impuestas a Alemania en el Tratado de Versalles, el Plan Marshall ofrecía curación y ayuda financiera, un mensaje de esperanza, no de miedo.  Christiana Figueres, la principal responsable del cambio climático en la ONU, tiene ante sí una tarea tan enorme como la de los arquitectos de ese plan. Es responsable de la respuesta mundial al calentamiento global, una amenaza potencialmente más catastrófica que cualquier desastre conocido, pero con un desarrollo tan lento que los Gobiernos y la opinión pública han podido hacer caso omiso de ella durante más de tres décadas desde que los científicos comenzaran a demostrar de manera irrefutable los peligros que plantean las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero a la estabilidad de nuestro planeta. Los Gobiernos se darán cita en París en una conferencia decisiva, en un intento de forjar un nuevo tratado global, con la esperanza de que sea tan efectivo y tan trascendental como el Plan Marshall, que limite las emisiones de carbono futuras y que aporte ayuda financiera a los pobres que serán los más perjudicados por los efectos del calentamiento. Mucho en juego, poco progreso histórico Lo que está en juego no podría ser más importante. Hace ya más de 20 años desde que los Gobiernos realizaran sus primeros esfuerzos conjuntos para controlar las emisiones y tratar el cambio climático. Desde entonces, las emisiones han seguido aumentando en gran medida casi cada año, excepto en los marcados por la crisis financiera.  En 1992, cuando se firmó la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático (CMNUCC), que obligaba a los países a evitar niveles peligrosos de calentamiento, el contenido de carbono de nuestra atmósfera era de unas 356 partes por millón (ppm), en su mayoría vertido a la atmósfera desde la Revolución Industrial. Ahora, se encuentra en 398 ppm, no lejos de las 450 ppm que los científicos calculan como el umbral superado el cual nuestro clima cambiará drásticamente y de forma irreversible, produciendo extremos climáticos, inundaciones, sequías, olas de calor y haciendo prácticamente inhabitables franjas del planeta. La historia de los esfuerzos internacionales sobre el cambio climático hasta ahora ha sido la de tratados ineficaces e ignorados, de disputas impropias sobre qué naciones deberían soportar la mayor “carga”, como si la salvación del único planeta que tenemos se pudiera describir así, y de fanfarronerías políticas aderezadas con recriminaciones despiadadas. El progreso, si se mide en emisiones de carbono, ha sido nulo. Figueres es plenamente consciente de todo esto. Nació en el seno de una familia costarricense con buenas conexiones políticas, hija del hombre que dirigió la transición del país a la democracia y que sirvió tres veces como su presidente. Después de formarse como antropóloga, dedicó su vida al servicio público. Como miembro del equipo costarricense de negociación climática desde 1995, ayudó en la redacción del Protocolo de Kioto y de los posteriores acuerdos. Cuando se le pregunta por qué decidió trabajar en el ámbito del cambio climático, cuenta la historia sobre el sapo dorado que antiguamente era común en Costa Rica y que se extinguió en 1989. Figueres tiene ilustraciones de ese sapo en las paredes de su despacho. “Veía esta especie cuando era niña y cuando tuve a mis dos hijas, la especie ya no existía”, comenta. “Para mí fue un gran impacto, porque me di cuenta de que estaba dejando a mis hijas, que entonces eran muy muy jóvenes, pues nacieron en 1988 y 1989, un planeta mermado por nuestra irresponsabilidad, por nuestra insensatez”. Esta reflexión fue lo que la llevó a trabajar en el problema climático. Figueres tiene una figura compacta, formal y directa, dura, con momentos de ímpetu. Responde a cada pregunta de inmediato, con firmeza, aportando hechos concretos y conclusiones rápidas, a veces con humor. En el contexto de las conversaciones sobre el clima, se muestra centrada y seria, independientemente del caos que exista a su alrededor. Pero esta vez no espera que cunda el caos. “Durante muchos meses no se ha cuestionado si vamos a llegar a un acuerdo [en París]”, afirma. “Ahora la pregunta es lo ambicioso que será el acuerdo. A principios de este año, cuando comencé a hablar sobre cómo vamos a llegar a un acuerdo, la gente se mostraba incrédula. Ahora creo que todo el mundo lo da por hecho: vamos a llegar a un acuerdo, porque hay suficiente voluntad política, cada vez hay más voluntad política. Tiene un sentido económico fundamental. La estimulación de esta transformación [hacia una economía de bajas emisiones de carbono] beneficia a los intereses nacionales de los países”. Si las negociaciones de la ONU son un éxito este año, Figueres desempeñará la función clave. Tiene tres tareas fundamentales: garantizar que los países se atienen a los estrictos objetivos sobre las emisiones, aportar a los países en desarrollo ayuda financiera del mundo rico para desarrollar energías ecológicas y para adaptarse al calentamiento global y redactar el borrador que se convierta en el instrumento legal indisputable que firmarán los países. Pero ahora una sombra se cierne sobre las conversaciones de París. Los ataques que mataron a 130 personas y dejaron cientos de heridos han marcado profundamente a Francia y a Europa. Para muchos franceses, el problema a largo plazo del cambio climático puede parecer irrelevante, comparado con su peligro actual.  El expresidente Nicolas Sarkozy propuso que se retrasara la cumbre, pero François Hollande insistió en que debían seguir adelante. Se aumentará la seguridad, sobre todo para los más de 130 líderes mundiales que se espera que asistan, incluidos Barack Obama, Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, Angela Merkel y David Cameron. Se ha cancelado una marcha por París planificada por grupos de la sociedad civil y otras manifestaciones se silenciarán. Figueres respondió rápidamente a la atrocidad. “Un dolor profundo. Me solidarizo con París y con toda Francia”, escribió en Twitter. Ha sido su única declaración pública. In deep pain. Standing in solidarity with Paris and the whole of France pic.twitter.com/fQ13WieX0w Las entrevistas de The Guardian tuvieron lugar antes de los eventos y rechazó la oferta de hacer comentarios adicionales en este artículo. Entre bambalinas, su equipo ha estado trabajando estrechamente con el Gobierno francés, sobre la seguridad y sobre cómo gestionar a las diferentes delegaciones de forma distinta.¿Qué repercusiones tendrá en las conversaciones?  Es inevitable que a los líderes mundiales les pregunten sobre el terrorismo antes que sobre el calentamiento global y puede que sea el tema que domine algunas de sus reuniones privadas. Pero la crudeza de los eventos espantosos cambiarán el ambiente, que será más serio, más respetuoso y más diligente. Los delegados estarán sometidos a una mayor presión que nunca para llegar a un acuerdo y para abstenerse de esos gestos de fanfarronería política y teatralidad que tiñeron las conversaciones anteriores. Las conversaciones previas de este año se han demorado por las disputas sobre la letra pequeña, la colocación de algunas frases, los detalles del lenguaje y la intención. Todo esto parecerá una trivialidad en una ciudad en duelo y manchada de sangre y pocos Gobiernos querrán adoptar una postura egoísta o histriónica, que prive a Francia de una dosis de esperanza y éxito. La solidaridad fraguada en la tragedia podría ser la clave del éxito. Los pronósticos para llegar a un acuerdo son positivos: con la cuidadosa planificación llevada a cabo por Figueres y los anfitriones franceses se ha garantizado la eliminación de los principales obstáculos con mucha antelación. La cifra clave que debe recordarse es 2 ºC, el umbral de calentamiento en comparación con las temperaturas preindustriales para que se produzca un peligroso cambio climático, una cifra en la que coincide la comunidad científica. Según las tendencias actuales, si no se adoptara ninguna acción en París, el mundo se calentaría hasta 5 ºC este siglo. Aunque no pueda parecer mucho, recordemos que la última edad de hielo solo fue unos 5 ºC más fría que las temperaturas medias actuales. Para Figueres, el objetivo de 2 ºC ahora se puede alcanzar. Los Gobiernos que representan más del 90% de las emisiones globales han presentado planes a la ONU que, de seguirse, producirían un calentamiento de entre 2,7 ºC y 3 ºC, según distintos análisis. Figueres corroboró estos hallazgos afirmando: “Las [promesas, conocidas como Contribuciones previstas y determinadas a nivel nacional] tienen la capacidad de limitar el aumento previsto de la temperatura a aproximadamente 2,7 ºC para 2100, que en ningún caso es suficiente, pero que es mucho menor que los cuatro o cinco grados más de calentamiento estimados por muchos antes de las Contribuciones”. Ahora es crucial progresar. “Las inversiones que vamos a realizar globalmente en los próximos cinco, diez o como máximo 15 años, pero sin duda las que se realizarán en los próximos cinco años, determinarán la calidad de vida de las generaciones futuras”, afirma, “así de sencillo”. Lo más importante es que un acuerdo en París incluya también un mecanismo de revisión de los planes de emisiones nacionales cada cinco años, para incrementar con regularidad los compromisos. En el ámbito financiero, se ha progresado en gran medida. En la cumbre de Copenhague de 2009, los países ricos prometieron que el mundo en desarrollo recibiría una ayuda financiera de 100.000 millones de años anuales para 2020, con el fin de ayudar a los países a reducir las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero y a sobrellevar las repercusiones del cambio climático. La OCDE determinó en un informe este otoño que alrededor del 60% de esos flujos financieros ya estaban sucediendo, con fondos procedentes de Gobiernos de países ricos, bancos de desarrollo como el Banco Mundial y el sector privado. Un informe del Instituto de Recursos Mundiales exponía que el resto posiblemente se entregará para 2020, con fondos de instituciones públicas y fuentes privadas. Seguirá habiendo discusiones sobre la forma legal: ¿será un tratado, un protocolo o “un resultado acordado con validez jurídica”, como se estipuló en conversaciones anteriores? Se puede decir que esta última opción es la más débil, pero seguiría representando un acuerdo jurídicamente vinculante, el santo grial de las conversaciones sobre el clima. ¿Qué aspectos pueden salir mal? El la cumbre sobre el clima de Copenhague de 2009, en la que las naciones supuestamente debían firmar un acuerdo jurídicamente vinculante que regiría la respuesta mundial al cambio climático en las próximas décadas, las perspectivas eran también muy buenas. Antes de la reunión y por primera vez, tanto las naciones desarrolladas como las que estaban en desarrollo acordaron conjuntamente la contención de las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. Para los países ricos, esto implicaba reducciones absolutas de sus emisiones de carbono. En el caso del mundo pobre, significaba imponer límites a sus emisiones futuras. Pero Copenhague acabó con escenas de caos y de amargas recriminaciones entre países. Un acuerdo plenamente vinculante era algo inalcanzable, aunque las principales economías desarrolladas y en desarrollo sí firmaron una “declaración política” para limitar sus objetivos de emisiones para 2020 y que sigue en vigor actualmente. El palabras de la propia Figueres, fue “el fracaso más exitoso que hemos vivido”. El mal resultado de Copenhague en parte se debió a que los líderes mundiales llegaron en el último minuto, con la intención de firmar un acuerdo que aún no se había escrito. Cuando llegaron, sus negociadores aún estaban inmersos en conversaciones detalladas sobre un texto, discutiendo sobre la colocación de las comas y sobre la delicada redacción.  Si bien los países más grandes acordaron objetivos de emisiones, no se llegó a un compromiso sobre la ayuda financiera a los pobres y los países en desarrollo no pudieron llevarse a casa eso. Muchos líderes mundiales aprovecharon su momento en el escenario mundial y el fulgor de los medios de comunicación del mundo como una oportunidad para expresar arraigados agravios que poco tenían que ver con el cambio climático. Con estas posturas teatrales, aunque se había llegado a un acuerdo, las escenas de discordia y de malestar diplomático fueron con lo que se quedó la opinión pública. Figueres se ha esforzado para evitar estas situaciones esta vez y, ante las circunstancias trágicas en las que se desarrollarán las conversaciones en París, la mayoría de países serán prudentes para no caer en el histrionismo. Esta vez, se ha incluido a los grupos de la sociedad civil en una fase previa y los líderes mundiales llegarán al inicio, con el fin de resolver diferencias y ofrecer instrucciones a sus delegados para que lleguen a un acuerdo equitativo lo antes posible. La función de Figueres en este sentido ha sido vital. Mientras hablamos, tiene que hacer pausas para responder a algunas llamadas. Una es de la oficina del Príncipe de Gales, que acudirá a París para intentar aunar a empresas, ONGs y Gobiernos, con su inigualable poder de convocatoria. “Un cruzado del clima fantástico, un referente de acción”, le califica Figueres. Esta especie de diplomacia “suave”, que implica horas de interacciones personales de Figueres con las principales figuras que se espera que den forma a las conversaciones, ha sido fundamental para crear un ambiente en el que los líderes se sientan capaces de llegar a un acuerdo. Si París es un éxito, gran parte del mérito se deberá atribuir a Figueres. Aprendió la lección en Copenhague, ha trabajado estrechamente con los anfitriones franceses en una acción diplomática sin precedentes por todo el mundo. También cita “cambios en la economía real, cambios en los fundamentos”: el coste de la energía renovable se ha desplomado (la energía solar es un 70% más barata que en 2009), ha aumentado la inversión en combustibles limpios y ahora la mayoría de las grandes economías del mundo cuentan con legislaciones sobre las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero. “En Copenhague, intentamos coger la enorme cúpula de una catedral y dejarla caer sin que hubiera pilares. ¿Dónde estaban esos pilares necesarios? Obviamente, la cúpula se cayó y se hizo pedazos. Esta vez, contamos con pilares muy sólidos”, afirma. Pero Figueres también se beneficia del cambio radical en la geopolítica del clima que se ha producido desde Copenhague: el giro en la postura de China sobre la cooperación internacional en el calentamiento global. Pero lo que se consiga en París no se ha creado en Francia, sino en Durban, en Sudáfrica, en 2011, cuando lo que se esperaba que fuera otra reunión anual rutinaria de la CMNUCC se convirtió en la conferencia sobre el clima más extraordinaria jamás vista, lo que cambió en gran medida el curso de las conversaciones desarrolladas en 20 años. Una persona propuso un plan. Connie Hedegaard, la responsable de asuntos del clima en la UE, había sido ministra de Medio Ambiente de Dinamarca durante las conversaciones de Copenhague y estaba dispuesta a corregir la “pesadilla” en la que se había convertido Copenhague. Quería convencer a otros Gobiernos para que establecieran una nueva fecha límite para acordar los compromisos sobre emisiones que entrarían en vigor en 2020, cuando acabaran los establecidos en Copenhague. Durante las dos semanas de conversaciones en Durban, reunió una “coalición de ambición”, integrada principalmente por los países más pobres que serían los más afectados por el cambio climático. El día final, contaba con más de 130 países a su favor. Pero seguían oponiéndose los Gobiernos de dos países: China e India.Lo que sucedió después fue una extraordinaria prueba de resistencia. El fin de las conversaciones estaba previsto para las 6 pm del segundo viernes de la reunión y los anfitriones querían acabar e irse a casa. Pero Hedegaard se negó. Al final, en las primeras hora del domingo por la mañana, cuando despuntaba el alba sobre Durban, los oponentes cedieron y Hedegaard se salió con la suya. China e India, al ver que estaba aislados y que sus aliados tradicionales no les apoyarían, acordaron una programación para hablar sobre un acuerdo para después de 2020. Esa programación era para la cumbre de París en 2015. Desde ese momento, la postura de China ha cambiado notablemente. Rápidamente se hizo un llamamiento a las principales autoridades de China para que dieran forma a una nueva postura que implicara límites en las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, lo que también beneficiaría a sus ciudadanos, que ya sufrían la espantosa calidad del aire, producto de las centrales eléctricas sin restricciones y accionadas con carbón y la industria contaminante, con nuevas normativas que impusieran estándares más estrictos a todos. El año pasado, China acordó por primera vez poner un límite máximo a sus emisiones, un elemento clave para un acuerdo en París. Figueres se ha beneficiado de la dureza de Hedegaard y de los cambios políticos que se han producido. Está dispuesta a aprovechar la situación. “Los humanos no tienen una fuerza rectora más fuerte que el propio interés. Es algo que se aplica a usted, a mí, pero también a nivel nacional. No existe una fuerza rectora más fuerte que el interés nacional. Así que ahora tenemos fuerzas muy fuertes con las que estamos trabajando”. Para Figueres, París también significa un legado personal. Cuando finalice la cumbre y, según espera la ONU, se desarrolle un nuevo proceso de conversaciones futuras, dejará su cargo. Sus planes futuros están en el aire, comenta encogiéndose de hombros. Para entonces, espera haber logrado lo que nadie ha conseguido antes: un acuerdo legal y vinculante que baste para reducir las emisiones según el consejo científico y que acatarán los Gobiernos de todo el mundo durante la próxima década y más allá. Si bien responde rápidamente a las preguntas, la única vez en nuestras conversaciones en la que duda es cuando se le pregunta sobre el destino de los países pobres si las conversaciones de París fracasan. “Espero que no fracasemos”, dice al final. “Serán los que sufran las consecuencias”.Y aparta la mirada, con lágrimas en los ojos."

"This week, world leaders are meeting in Paris to reach a new climate agreement to keep global temperature rise to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. Yet the responsibility for tackling climate change, and sustainability issues more broadly, does not rest on the shoulders of politicians and diplomats alone. Australian business also has an important role to play and there are two reasons they should care: risk and opportunity. Climate change is a massive risk to the business community. Every industry must consider its specific risk to income and expenses but most commonly these will include physical impacts, regulation, competition, insurance, changing markets, investment, energy infrastructure and litigation.  For Australian businesses, the risks around extreme weather are particularly high. More than half of the world’s natural disasters occurred in the Asia Pacific in 2014 and Australia is the most vulnerable advanced economy to the impacts of climate change. More than $226bn in commercial, industrial, road, rail and residential assets around Australia’s coast are potentially exposed to flooding and erosion hazards at a sea level rise of 1.1 m – a high end but quite plausible scenario for 2100. There’s also a growing body of research which looks at the possible ways in which our financial systems themselves may be vulnerable to climate risk. Consider the physical impacts alone: so far global temperatures have increased nearly 1C. That may not sound like much, but in the past 50 years heatwaves have become hotter, last longer and occur more often. The increase in hot weather observed in the decade between 2000 and 2009 has already reached the best estimate projected for 2030.  In the summer of 2013/14 – known as the “angry summer” – 156 records were broken in 90 days. Similarly 2015 is likely to surpass 2014 as the hottest year on record, while October was the hottest October on record for Australia. Recent research by David Karoly and colleagues from the University of Melbourne shows that human-driven climate change made this new record at least six times more likely than it would otherwise have been. October’s temperature was also the most above-normal month globally in history and was the eighth month this year to set a new heat record.  These impacts have many consequences for business. Lost productivity and absenteeism due to extreme heat is costing the Australian economy almost $8bn a year. Recently a study from the University of Cambridge described how, as awareness of climate-related risks grows, climate–smart businesses are beginning to question how global environmental trends – such as increasing pressure on agricultural land, food security, soil degradation, local water stress and extreme weather events – will affect financial markets. This builds on the work of leading economists such as Nicholas Stern in the UK and Ross Garnaut here in Australia, who argue the benefits of early action lead to significantly higher economic growth rates and returns over the long run, especially when compared to a worst-case scenario of climate inaction. Simply put, inaction is a risky business. Of course business is also about creating opportunities and there will be plenty as humanity weans itself off fossil fuels and creates a clean, healthy and vibrant economy. Back in 2007, the Climate Institute described how the move to a carbon-constrained global economy could deliver strategic opportunities, such as building new markets, corporate positioning, gaining regulatory intelligence and competitive advantage. “Business as usual” is no longer an option and that change is inevitable.  A recent New Climate Economy report contends it is possible to have more equitable, more sustainable and more resilient economies. An exciting area is the rapid innovation and declining costs of clean energy technologies. The price of solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, for example, has dropped 75% and onshore wind power has fallen 30% over the last five years. More than 7.7 million people are now employed globally in the renewable energy sector. Last year for the first time, global emissions shrank while the economy grew. This was driven primarily by clean energy solutions. The United States has witnessed a swathe of corporate giants sign up to the White House’s American Business Act on Climate Pledge. The pledge recognised that delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to sustainable economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters and the health of the global environment. General Mills, a global food company and recent signatory, said addressing climate change was imperative to its long-term viability as climate change places significant pressure on vulnerable growing regions that produce many important crops. In Australia, the most significant business announcement to date arrived from Commonwealth Bank and NAB. Both banks have made overarching commitments to the 2C goal. Although they are still working out the finer detail, these commitments are significant because they inherently require the banks to transition funding away from fossil fuels that drive climate change. So what can all Australian businesses do? First, they must make their voices heard on climate change. Business is a powerful advocate for policy change and has been largely silent in the climate debate in Australia until recently.   Second, business should be powered with renewable energy. Ten percent of all emissions are created by commercial buildings and addressing this is a prudent business decision as well as beneficial to the environment. Finally there is huge scope to invest in energy efficiency in Australia, which will also impact the bottom line. These investments will provide a competitive edge as information on energy and greenhouse gas management practices are increasingly requested by customers and are required in tender documents. In a recent blog, KPMG’s Adrian King discussed what a climate deal in Paris might mean for businesses, stressing that high-carbon activities would be costlier and businesses would face tighter regulation, carbon pricing and more stringent targets for emissions cutting. On the up side, this means the case for becoming a low-carbon business will be stronger (and more profitable) than ever before. When it comes to such opportunities, the adage “first in, best dressed” holds true. While there is still time to act, the window of opportunity is finite and shrinking. Those who are nimble and forward-looking enough to act first will be in the best position to benefit from what US President Barack Obama referred to at the Asia-Pacific Forum on Economic Cooperation to as a “business boom”."

"The perennial cry: we need to talk about climate change. And this week, with world leaders in Paris, we have been. But only up to a point. For the likely impact of the rising global population is almost entirely absent, not only from the debate about climate change, but also from that about loss of biological diversity, food and water security, disease, pollution and energy.  Let’s just remind ourselves of the population statistics of the past half century. In just over half my lifetime, the world’s population has more than doubled, from 3 billion people to now more than 7 billion. The ability to feed some of this growing population has in no small part been a consequence of the advent of the green revolution: that is, the industrialisation and intensification of agriculture and the entire food production system. Producing all this food requires a lot of water. In fact, approximately 70% of all usable water on Earth is now used for food production. And almost 40% of the entire (ice free) land surface of the planet is now dedicated to agriculture. The green revolution made more food, and that made food much cheaper. As a result of this – and increasing industrialisation and globalisation over the same period – those of us in Europe, North America and Japan have had much more money to spend on consumption. In fact, we embarked upon the creation of an unprecedented consumer culture – of clothes, televisions, electronics, mobile phones, cars and holidays. All the food and other things we have been producing and consuming require a lot of energy – to generate the basic materials, manufacturing, transport, use, and disposal. As a result our use of oil, coal and gas has increased dramatically to meet rocketing demand for energy consumption. We are now starting to see the first signs of the impact this is having on our life support system: Earth. Agricultural intensification is causing serious soil degradation and depletion of groundwater in some of the most agriculturally intensive and important areas of the planet. Land use for agriculture, urbanisation and infrastructure (eg roads) continues to cause loss of habitat for much of the world’s biodiversity. It is not just terrestrial ecosystems that are being degraded. Many of the world’s marine ecosystems are being rapidly degraded by overfishing, pollution and ocean acidification. Demand for energy by our increasing population over the past half-century has led to an accumulation of atmospheric carbon dioxide, the concentration of which – now 400 parts per million – has not been present on this planet for several million years. And yes, the result of this – of all our activities and consumption – is the emerging change in our climate apparent in the rise in global average temperature and, more importantly, the frequency of extreme weather events: heat waves, floods, droughts. The climate change now emerging is predominantly a consequence of the past activities of fewer than 3 billion people; not the current activities of 7 billion of us. Critics of the book in which I lay out this problem, Ten Billion, have sought to remind me that, in fact, the fertility rate has been declining since the 1960s. And that we will in any event technologise our way out of the problems we now face. And that I am therefore being alarmist in my claims that climate change, ecosystem degradation, land degradation, and risks to food and water security are going to get worse. I know the global fertility rate has been dropping. Yet the global population has more than doubled over the 50 years in which the fertility rate has been declining, and the UN projects that there are set to be at least 10 billion of us in just a few decades. Moreover, population growth in many counties is rising rapidly. According to the United Nations, the population of Afghanistan is projected to grow by 242% in the next 80 years; the population of Iraq by 344%; Nigeria by over 400% – to possibly more than 900 million people – and that of Malawi and Niger by more than 700%. This is not just a “developing countries” issue. The United States is projected to grow by more than 40% from 315 million to 450 million people in the next 80 years. According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK population is projected to grow from 64 million in 2014 to 85 million in the next 80 years. That is like adding the inhabitants of 20 new cities the size of Birmingham to the UK. Most of the evidence points to our current “business as usual” trajectory of growth and consumption, leading to all of our problems getting worse; potentially much worse.  According to the US government’s Energy Information Authority, global energy demand is likely to triple this century, as both population and energy demand per capita increase sharply, with much of that energy demand continuing to be met chiefly by oil, coal and gas, even under optimistic scenarios of growth in “renewable” energy technologies. Demand for food is set to double by 2050 as a result of increasing population and consumption per capita – especially as more people move to an increasingly meat-based diet. So-called “rational optimists” are quick to claim that this demand will be easily met without significant further appropriation of land for agricultural use thanks to the ongoing “miracle” of the green revolution. This ignores the fact that soil degradation and erosion are increasing rapidly in many parts of the world; that many of the world’s crops are increasingly at risk from novel (primarily) fungal pathogens; and that climate and crop models showing the number of extreme weather events associated with predicted future climate change are projected to have potentially devastating effects on crops in significant parts of the world. Indeed, there are ample reasons to be concerned that we may be heading towards unprecedented food crises over the coming decades, with consequent extremely deleterious risks to the health of hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of people. Furthermore, in many parts of the world where population is increasing rapidly, there is a rise in the number of people living in close quarters with pigs and poultry (not to mention the increasing consumption of “bush meat”). And as a consequence we are greatly increasing the risk of a novel pathogen crossing the species barrier and creating a truly terrifying global pandemic. Remarkably, collectively, we seem to want to deny all of this: that we are the drivers of the main problems facing us this century; and that, as we continue to grow, these problems are set to get worse. Climate change, extreme weather events, pollution, ecosystem degradation – the fundamental alteration of every component of the complex system we rely upon for our survival – are due to the activities of the rising human population. There are no simple solutions: but leaders at the Paris summit cannot even begin to tackle climate change unless they recognise that its parent – our increasing population – is creating a greater looming crisis. • This article was amended on 10 December 2015. An earlier version said “more than 50%” where “more than 40%” was meant."
"The international praise shows no sign of abating. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s speech on Monday at the United Nations climate conference in Paris – declaring that “Canada is back” – was received with a standing ovation. Everywhere he went during a short appearance he was met by cheers and demands for selfies. A few days before, the New York Times touted his “swift about-face,” congratulating him for “reversing course” on climate change. Amazing what a winning smile and a few small gestures can accomplish. For a start, Trudeau had merely to show up to distinguish himself from Canada’s former government. Stephen Harper had skipped last year’s UN climate summit in New York (though stopped by for the free dinner). The Conservative government’s antagonism to these international negotiations was conveyed not with diplomatic niceties, but the sophistication of a gang of apes.  So it’s easy to be encouraged by Trudeau’s change in tone and approach. But when you come back to the table, doesn’t it count what you bring? Over the course of an entire election, and since coming to power, the Liberal government has chosen not to even hint at new emissions targets, and so came to Paris with Stephen Harper’s – well below that of comparable European countries. Turns out the man with the sweet look is packing what the brutish guest before him brought. Six years ago in Copenhagen, at the last climate conference that was supposed to save the world, governments promised to keep warming below 2 degrees. Even then, low-lying Pacific Island nations insisted on a target of 1.5 degrees, so their countries could survive rising sea levels. African leaders called the two degrees warming target a “death sentence.” But now leaders’s targets won’t even meet that previous goal. Canada’s pledges, taken together with other countries, will hurtle us well beyond three degrees – warming approaching a level that climate scientist Kevin Anderson calls “incompatible with an organized global community.” To make matters worse, Trudeau joined the United States in saying the agreement does not need to be legally binding – a slap in the face of the world’s poorest countries. We know what happens when corporations or government are encouraged to voluntarily reduce emissions: very little at all. Or they go backwards. Canadian faith-based activist Christine Boyle in Paris posed the right question: “Why is it that Canada can support legally binding trade agreements, but not legally binding climate agreements?” But the double-standard is even worse than it seems.  Backed by Trudeau as much as Harper, the big trade agreements currently being ratified – the TransPacific Partnership and Canadian-European trade agreement - stand to undermine any ambitious climate policies. First off, they will massively increase high-emissions exports. They may ban green energy subsidies. And even more insidiously, they grant corporations the right to sue governments in private tribunals if environmental laws cut into their profit-making. Want to pass a moratorium against destructive shale gas fracking in Quebec? Get sued for $250 million. You’d think the Canadian government would know better: under existing trade pacts, they’re already the most sued government in the world. And yet Trudeau is prepared to pass them without even debate, contrary to an electoral promise. Trudeau has brought in some positive reforms: scientists are no longer muzzled, the attack on charitable groups have been called off, and he has pledged a few billion to a fund to help countries in the global south adapt to warming. But the danger in Trudeau’s plan on climate change is the same danger with the UN climate agreement itself: that failure is packaged as victory, that a hugely insufficient agenda is sold as positive change. All the principles Trudeau has touted on the international stage could reverse this at home – if he followed through on them. In Paris, Trudeau declared that Canada “will act based on the best scientific evidence and advice.” More than 3.6 million people around the world backed the same principle when they signed a petition, delivered by President of Marshall Islands to the UN earlier this week, calling for at least 80 percent of fossil fuels to be left in the ground and 100 percent renewable economies by 2050 – what the world’s top climate scientists have told is both possible and necessary. That scientific perspective should have some bearing on the biggest contributer to Canada’s increase in carbon emissions: the tar sands. Except Trudeau’s foreign affairs minister Stephane Dion has already explained that he supports their “sustainable growth.” Some scientific advice could put his confusion to rest: there is no sustainable way to shred pristine forest, peel back the earth’s skin, carve out the most carbon-intensive oil, and ship it for burning around the world.  Trudeau’s international audience was no less impressed when he declared that Indigenous peoples “have known for thousands of years how to care for our planet. The rest of us have a lot to learn. And no time to waste.” But one of Trudeau’s quickest moves was to backtrack on the idea of increased consultation with First Nations on energy projects. And the Liberals have already made clear they’ll be breaking another campaign promise: to overhaul ongoing pipeline reviews, which have become rubber stump venues that shut out of the full voices of, what a surprise, Indigenous peoples. And Trudeau won’t move the country toward low-carbon economy if his ministers have directions to push in the other direction. The Natural Resources Minister praised Alberta’s new climate plan, which allows for an 43 percent emissions increase, for one specific reason: it will undermine the resistance to pipelines. And as if to make clear the objective of government policy, he hired as chief-of-staff a former Shell employee and vice-president of Canada’s biggest oil lobby. What are those chisselling noises you hear? It’s the sound of principles being hollowed to the core. The most effective climate action in Canada hasn’t been thanks to any government: it’s been the work of popular movements, led by Indigenous peoples. By stopping fossil fuel projects and pipelines from being built, they’ve already kept billions of tar sands investment out of the tar sands – and carbon in the ground. But we need to do more than just hem in the worst of the government’s plans: we need bold national policy. Like massive public investment that puts people, starting with the worst impacted, to work in good jobs, building health communities, while radically scaling back emissions. On Thursday morning in Paris a group of Canadian youth delegates staged a protest: “We must be heard, not just seen,” they chanted in the conference halls. Their message to Trudeau: selfies won’t cut it. It’s time for substantive policy. Even if you believe that politicians deserve honeymoons, it might be time to declare that Trudeau’s is over. The stakes are too high. The timeline – dictated by science – too short. Abroad or at home, we can’t live with lowered expectations, satisfied by rhetoric alone. Trudeau’s government must start acting by their principles – or be forced to. On twitter: @Martin_Lukacs"
"El Niños, climate change and increasing conflict linked to prolonged droughts and extreme weather are leaving the world unable to cope with the food needs of millions of people, the World Food Programme (WFP) has warned. The UN agency, which last year appealed for $8.5bn from governments to provide food aid to people in 80 or more countries but only received $5.5bn, said donors had never been more generous but that the challenges were now outpacing available funds.   “The humanitarian system is increasingly stretched financially and operationally. Weather disasters require responses in more places and for longer periods,” said the WFP executive director, Ertharin Cousin, in Paris for the climate talks. “The global climate negotiations are critical for a world without hunger. Among the most significant impact of climate change is its potential to increase hunger and malnutrition. The current El Niño and complex droughts, storms and floods the world is experiencing today provide a window into what our future could look like if a meaningful climate agreement is not reached.” To streamline responses to food emergencies, the agency is trying to work ahead of weather-related disasters. Using three- to six-month regional climate forecasts the WFP can now predict pretty accurately where a food emergency will strike, nine months to a year ahead. But working with the UK Met Office and the Hadley Centre for climate change, it has now mapped for the first time the potential effects on world hunger of increasing temperatures.  The map shows that, at present, Africa and Asia have hotspots of predictable vulnerability. But once data from the IPCC’s fifth assessment report on climate change is factored in, the map turns darker and it is possible to see which countries will be most affected by temperature increases and extreme weather over the longer term.  If temperatures rise by only 2C, then millions more people would be affected across Central America, Africa and Asia. If temperatures were to rise between 4C and 5C, the map becomes covered in hotspots – suggesting a semi-pemanent food disaster in many parts of the world. Cousin will not predict the cost of providing humanitarian food aid on a much larger scale, but accepts it is likely to be many tens of billions of dollars a year. “Climate change has the potential to reverse the whole development path,” she says. The situation could potentially be even worse, as the maps do not factor in increasing conflict, which she says is linked to climate. “Most of WFP’s resources now go into conflict areas. It used to be to areas like the Sahel and East Africa which were most in need in need because of droughts. Now 50% of our entire operation is addressing a combination of climate and conflict.” Cousin echoes the World Bank, which has linked conflict with climate. “The data suggests a definite link between food insecurity and conflict. Climate is an added stress factor,” she says With this year’s El Niño expected to peak in the next few months, WFP says that Ethiopia, the Horn of Africa, Zimbabwe, Malawi and parts of Central America will be in great need of food aid. Better forecasting allows it to prepare communities ahead of failed harvests, but also gives governments more time to prepare food stocks and relief. “When the shock occurs we can trigger predictable funding and also funding to help people to recover afterwards. “We need new approaches. It’s the only way to help lift vulnerable people out of a cycle of chronic hunger and poverty, for good,” Cousin said.  She predicts that climate finance intended to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate change will need to be used to feed people."
"Buried in the detail of the Paris Accord could be some innocuous-looking words that will have a powerful impact on whether it ever delivers the greenhouse gas reductions it promises. The words could “paper over” deep divisions about whether countries ever have to properly report and account for the promised emission reductions that collectively limit global warming to the already-dangerous 2.7 degrees.  Key to the negotiations will be a trade off between developing countries’ demands for financing to reduce their own emissions and adapt to locked-in climate change and the insistence by both rich nations like the United States and climate-vulnerable countries like the small island states that every country should be required to at least work towards the same rules for reporting and checking their emission reductions. Since the pledges in the Paris Accord will not be legally binding and the more stringent rules applied to developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol are almost certain to lapse in five years, the direction set for this new set of reporting and checking rules is important to ensure the agreement delivers what it promises for the climate. Countries like India claim the existing rules under the overarching UN framework convention on climate change are fine. Dr Ajay Mathur, director general of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency in Delhi, said there was “no need to spend time again negotiating new reporting guidelines and rules when we already have rules that apply to everybody and give necessary flexibility to developing countries.” But those rules have far softer requirements for how and what developing countries report about their emission reductions. They do not require comprehensive reporting and do not force countries to detail how they are tracking towards the target they have pledged or to project their future greenhouse gas emissions. And the system for “expert review” of developing country reports is far less onerous than the in-country checking for developed nations. Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, said allowing the current system to continue was “not feasible” and would represent a “complete failure at the Paris talks”. “It would mean we couldn’t check or track what developing countries are doing,” he said. “There would be no way of knowing what was happening.” Transparency is a “red line” issue for countries like the United States and Australia. They are willing for common requirements to be phased in and for poor countries to get extra help to develop the systems they need to comply with the new rules, but are determined that the goal must be a common system. It would not include penalties or have any means to force compliance, but it would – eventually – provide a reasonably clear picture of what emissions reductions each country had achieved. And that, in turn, would create the trust necessary for countries to increase the ambition of their emission reduction targets over time, to bring global emissions to the level that might contain warming to 2 degrees or lower. President Obama made America’s position clear in his Paris speech. “Here in Paris, let’s agree to a strong system of transparency that gives each of us the confidence that all of us are meeting our commitments. And let’s make sure that the countries who don’t yet have the full capacity to report on their targets receive the support that they need,” he said. But developing countries like India and Saudi Arabia are adamant different reporting rules are enshrined in the 1992 convention’s recognition of the principle of “differentiation” between the responsibilities placed on rich and poor nations. In his speech to the conference, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said a “common but differentiated” responsibility had to “remain the bedrock” of the agreement because anything else would be morally wrong. The US has said it “would not support a bifurcated approach to the new agreement, particularly one based on groupings that may have made sense in 1992 but that are clearly not rational or workable in the post‐2020 era”. Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko, ambassador from South Africa and chair of the G77+China negotiating bloc said differentiation was “embedded ... and we should not have to renegotiate it here.” She objected to the “narrative” on transparency rules that cast poor countries as “villains” and also to the idea that rich countries’ promises on finance would be conditional on poor countries’ acceptance of common transparency rules. “Conditionality erodes trust ... it is not a responsible way to go,” she said. The Paris Accord will not finalise the reporting and review rules but it will set a direction. Rich countries want a path to a credible, common system. The alternative is wording papering over the fact that the current stand-off remains unresolved. According to the deputy chief executive of The Climate Institute, Erwin Jackson, “the danger in that outcome is that we continue the procedural battle we are currently seeing forever. It gives countries who want to weaken the process an opportunity to continue to throw spanners in the works for years to come.” Richard Chatterton, head of climate policy for Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said differentiation was the issue that could “derail” the Paris talks. He said the most likely outcome was the conference would find “wording” that “effectively sweeps differentiation under the carpet”, meaning it would be fought out for years to come."
"Malcolm Turnbull has been urged to show the same interest in the impact of climate change on low lying island island states as Barack Obama and to return Australia “to its former leadership role in the Pacific.” Speaking after foreign minister Julie Bishop ridiculed a Labor claim that one of the Marshall Islands had disappeared into the sea, Marshall Island’s foreign minister Tony de Brum told Guardian Australia he was hoping Australia might soon start to take the countries’ fears about the impact of climate change as seriously as the US president did.  Obama recognised the importance and special concerns of the low lying states in a meeting on the sidelines of the Paris conference on Tuesday with leaders from Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, St Lucia, Barbados and Papua New Guinea. Speaking after the meeting, Obama described himself as “an island boy”, referring to his childhood on Hawaii, and urged the conference to listen to their concerns. “Their population are amongst the most vulnerable to the ravages of climate change ... Some of their nations could disappear entirely and as weather patterns change, we might deal with tens of millions of climate refugees in the Asia Pacific region,” he said. He said Paris summit must “serve the interests of the most vulnerable” as well as the most powerful. Bishop had mocked her Labor counterpart Tanya Plibersek in parliament on Tuesday for claiming the island of Eneko had “disappeared” due to rising sea levels when in fact it was a “beautiful and accessible beach getaway”.  “You can rent a bungalow for $50 a night. It is in good condition, we’re told. There are houses, lawns, gardens, there is a toilet block and there are picnic tables,” Bishop said. It subsequently emerged that Plibersek’s transcript had misnamed the island, and that she had been referring to a different island, called Anebok, which had disappeared. De Brum said Australia had in recent years “not been very supportive of our goals.” “The meeting with Obama was one of the most significant meetings we have had in a long long time. He bolstered the idea that even though we are small we have to have a voice in these negotiations. We did not meet with Turnbull in Paris but we hope we might engage with him in the future. He an island boy as well, from a very big island. “There is a lot of room for improvement for Australia to return to its former leadership role in the Pacific,” de Brum said. Speaking to Guardian Australia in Paris, opposition leader accused Bill Shorten accused Bishop of having a “Peter Dutton moment” – a reference to the immigration minister’s joke – picked up on a boom mic – about rising sea levels in the Pacific. “Her comments makes Australia look stupid. The Pacific islands see Australia as a big brother and Julie Bishop is treating their concerns as a political football,” he said. “This was a Peter Dutton moment for Julie Bishop. She is a more sophisticated personality than Peter Dutton and she should know better than to play gotcha games with this policy.” Shorten and Plibersek travelled to Kiribati and the Marshall Islands in October to investigate the impacts of climate change and Shorten had pictures of where Anebok had been on his mobile phone. Leaders of neighbouring Pacific nations have long tried to put pressure on Australia and New Zealand to take a tougher stance in the international talks on climate change and to take on more ambitious domestic policies. Obama did not change his administration’s opposition to some of their demands, including so-called “loss and damage” payments from major economies based on historical emissions and the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees instead of 2 degrees. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd, who is also at the climate summit said the South Pacific countries had been “utterly contemptuous of the positions being adopted by the Abbott government and that was beginning to fracture Australia’s foreign policy position in the Pacific: but were now “suspending doubt” to see whether the new Australian prime minister implemented policy changes. In the detailed negotiations in Paris Australian officials are understood to be backing some of the island states goals, including looking for a way to “reference” the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees and their particular vulnerability to climate change."

"World leaders gathered in Paris on Monday for the crucial UN summit on climate change to negotiate a treaty to limit global warming to 2C, the widely accepted temperature threshold to avert catastrophic disasters. But in case the landmark conference was an insufficient reason to make you aware of this, then 147 heads of state and government were present to convey the weight of history with the power of language alone. While we might like them to compete with their climate change targets, first we had to be patient and let them compete with their rhetoric. Here are the best of the bunch from a day of competing metaphors. Laurent Fabius, French foreign minister and president of COP21,  got the speeches off to a promising start with the most overused metaphor of the day; happily wrung dry by politicians and activists alike.  The eyes of the world are upon and there are great hopes, it is therefore for us to meet our responsibilities head on so that on 11 December we can say the world the four words the world is waiting to hear: our mission is accomplished. I have my #eyesonParis with @oxfamcanada for a #climatechange deal that puts people hit hardest first. Do you? pic.twitter.com/TIBjrtiKUi Chinese president Xi Jinping took up the mantle too: “Tackling climate change is a shared mission for mankind. All eyes are now on Paris.” Obama warned that it is not just eyes alive today that are watching but those from the future too. “Let there be no doubt. The next generation is watching what we do.” But head of the UN’s climate change body Christiana Figueres had to step in to remind the conference that this particular metaphor is so much more than a metaphor. “The eyes of millions of people are on you, not just figuratively but literally,” she said. Goodness knows how they would have coped had they known that extra-terrestrial eyes were upon them too. From space we are privileged to see the beauty of Earth but also our impact on it's environment. #COP21 #YearInSpace pic.twitter.com/rCD3PIDIX5 Not to be outdone, French president Francois Hollande wanted to make sure we realise that the politicians are not only feeling the pressure in their eyes, but upon their shoulders too.  Ladies and gentlemen, the hope of all humanity rests on your shoulders. The greatest danger is not that we aim too high and we miss but that we aim too low and we hit it. Here in Paris we will decide on the very future of the planet. Figures meanwhile was more concerned about hands than shoulders. “Never before has a responsibility so great been in the hands of so few,” she worried. But Prince Charles warned delegates that they should be concerned about some very particular hands: those of French cheesemakers. Accepting that others might think it “silly” he revealed his fears: “In a microbe-free, progressive and genetically engineered future, what hope is there for the old-fashioned Fourme d’Ambert, the mal-formed Gruyere de Comte or the odorous Pont L’Eveque?” An observer on Reddit attempted to return some calm to the situation: With their hands, shoulder and eyes so weighed down, it’s a wonder any of them made it up to the podium. An old un’ is a good un’. Prince Charles, back for more, chose to draw less attention to his feelings and more attention to how the the planet might be feeling.  Downright ill, by any measure. “The whole of nature cries out at our mistreatment of her,” he lamented. “If the planet were a patient, we would have treated her long ago. You, ladies and gentlemen, have the power to put her on life support, and you must surely start the emergency procedures without further procrastination!” The Prince of Wales would likely have taken the top prize for rhetorical flourishes had it not been a second-hand metaphor, a shadow of its former self which appeared in a speech he made back in February when he warned that “failure to write the prescription, however, might leave us contemplating the death certificate instead.” You’ll be sad to learn it wasn’t as good as Martin Luther King’s.  But it is one that keeps haunting Hungary’s president. János Áder recalled the conservation he keeps having with his unborn grandchild, who repeatedly asks with consternation: Grandpa, I grew up to be an adult in a period when the impacts of climate change posed a direct threat to human civilisation. I still have this nagging question however. Could you have stopped in your own time all that has happened by today? Why didn’t you listen to scientists? Why did you disregard scientific evidence? Unfortunately for the unborn child, Áder seems to be more of a listener than a speaker. Ader is yet to offer an answer to the persistent questions. David Cameron’s speech seemed to be less of a speech and more of a rehearsal. Taking inspiration from Áder, the UK prime minister seemed to adhere to the rule that the magnitude of your metaphors is inversely proportional to the extent of your policies. “Let’s just imagine for a moment what we’d have to say to our grandchildren if we failed,” he pondered aloud. “We’d have to say it was all too difficult. They’d reply – well what was so difficult? Presumably we might have to say – well it was difficult to reach a binding agreement.” The grandchildren duly replied: “Why is it difficult to reach a binding agreement when in 2015 there were 75 countries across most of the continents of our world that already have legally binding climate change agreement – countries like Britain?” The dialogue continued, although the grandchildren in question did not appear to wonder why in 2015 subsides for solar energy and onshore wind were dramatically cut, why the flagship green homes scheme was given the axe or why much of the green investment bank was sold off, not forgetting the cancellation of a £1bn carbon capture and storage competition last week. Perhaps it was all too difficult.  Back in the UK, the speech was not greeted with delight.  David Cameron: Angry about climate inaction in same way he is angry over cuts to Oxfordshire Council services? “That husky must be turning in its grave,” quipped Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, in wistful remembrance of the prime minister’s iconic embrace with the dogs on Svalbard almost a decade ago.  But perhaps the wisest words of the day came from the end of Barack Obama’s speech. “Let’s get to work,” he said. Yes please, let’s."
"We need to come up with innovative solutions to look after our planet, and the Paris climate change conference is the place to do it. By innovative we don’t only mean new energy technology and new green financing mechanisms. We need to reimagine tropical forests as a public utility like electricity, producing a service people and governments, including in the rich world, want to buy. Forests are beautiful ecosystems of living organisms. But like your municipal water services and your local power company, forests provide a stream of services – storing carbon and cooling the planet – that most people get for free. Just as we pay for electricity services, and thus ensure their continuing provision, so we – especially in the rich world – should pay for the climate service that tropical forests provide. It’s easy to do in principle: satellite technology allows us to verify whether deforestation rates have declined in real time, and only pay for what’s delivered.   Fortunately, the thousands gathered in Paris and the millions of people they speak for are eager to buy these services. But how, exactly? A simple way is for the governments of rich countries to transfer funds to forest countries that keep trees standing. Those payments buy a service; they are not charitable contributions or foreign aid to which all kinds of conditions should be attached. We don’t set conditions on how Saudi Arabia can spend the money we pay for its oil – so why should we tell tropical forest countries what to do with money they earn for the forest services they provide? Buying the climate service standing trees provide is a bargain for the rich world: a cheaper way to reduce emissions than anything else on the table. Tropical deforestation releases more greenhouse gases each year than the entire European Union, and destroys the world’s most efficient system for carbon capture and storage. At current rates deforestation produces “only” around 10% of global emissions; maybe that’s why forests have been a challenge to get on the Paris agenda, and seldom make the headlines. But preserving tropical forests could take up as much as 30% of current global emissions, and is desperately needed to stay within the world’s carbon budget. Forest preservation is also a development imperative. World leaders have this year agreed on a universal set of sustainable development goals; continuing forest destruction puts such rhetoric to an immediate test.  Forests are especially important to people’s livelihoods in developing countries. Tropical forests reduce drought by creating rain (their destruction in the Amazon is a likely cause of the water crisis in São Paulo). An annual round of forest fires in Indonesia has created a serious health problem across south-east Asia. Healthy forests protect coastlines and watersheds, and provide sustainable food and timber for people living around them. The problem for the world is that forest destruction, often illegal, generates huge profits in the short term – via exports of timber, palm oil, cattle, soy and minerals. The leadership of countries with tropical forests face a tough tradeoff between apparent quick gains – higher growth and new (if mostly low-wage, insecure) jobs versus a sustainable flow of long-run collective benefits: clean water, lower pollution, drought-protected agriculture, slower silting of hydroelectric dams. Global commerce has too often made the real tradeoff between appropriation of forest assets for private wealth versus sustainable use in the public interest. And enforcing laws that protect forests is costly – resisting illegal licensing of logging or plantation development takes up money, political space and administrative capacity.  Still, many forest-rich developing countries are committed to protecting their forests, as evidence grows that the short-run gains are not worth the costs, and are often captured by a few at the expense of the many. These costs, in the worst cases, are counted in land wars and abuse of local people’s rights.  Our report, Look to the Forests, finds that developing countries want to scale up efforts to reduce deforestation, but that they need some compensation to look beyond short-term gains.  This year, 14 tropical forest nations signed up to the Lima Challenge, committing to eliminate deforestation by 2030 (pdf) if they can get some outside help in absorbing the costs, which is now happening. Brazil, Guyana, Indonesia, Liberia and Peru have agreements with Norway (and in the case of Peru the agreement also includes Germany) under which the rich countries are paying for some of the carbon capture climate service that the tropical forests provide to everyone in the world. Brazil began to face down those pressures 10 years ago, and Norway’s early promise of partial compensation has strengthened the hand of its local champions in the science community, in government and among its local civil society advocates. In the last decade, Brazil reduced deforestation by 80% without sacrificing agricultural output or growth. The head of the Amazon Fund at Brazil’s national development bank, BNDES, recently acknowledged that Brazil’s economy depends on maintaining the forests. Yet Brazil’s efforts (themselves at risk due to a faltering economy) are not repeated widely. The UN has the REDD+ system agreed among climate negotiators, under which tropical forest countries can be paid (with public or private funds) for the climate service they provide. It just got a boost, with an announcement on Monday from Norway, Germany and the UK of additional commitments of $5bn between 2015 and 2020 to pay tropical countries for verified performance in reducing deforestation. But even with another $5bn on the table, REDD+ is under-used. Policymakers gathered in Paris ought to be more ambitious. Tropical forest countries will “produce” reductions in deforestation for the REDD+ market if they see more buyers for the climate service their forests provide (for all of us). The world needs an ambitious REDD+ performance payment programme in the final Paris agreement.  • Pedro Pablo Kuczynski is former prime minister of Peru"
"You spend years trying to get people to take an interest in aircraft emissions. Then at last the issue gets picked up – but in the most perverse way possible. The pollutants spread by planes are a major issue. They make a significant contribution to global warming, yet they are excluded from international negotiations, such as the conference taking place in Paris. As a result, aviation’s expansion is unchecked by concerns about climate change.  This exclusion is ridiculous, not least because aircraft emissions have a particular role in heating the planet, due to the height at which they are released, and the multiplying impacts of the water vapour and other gases the planes produce. Gases that sometimes form contrails in the sky. You might expect me to be delighted by the fact that thousands of people are taking an interest in contrails and their effects, and campaigning against the airlines producing them. Far from it. The most vocal people protesting against aviation emissions have no interest in their contribution to global warming. Quite the opposite. Many of those now denouncing the pollution of the skies see climate science as part of the problem: a conspiracy by corporations, military planners and other nefarious interests to control the skies. Until recently, I ignored this movement, even as it spread among people I knew. So pervasive have the rumours become that the government, which seldom responds to conspiracy theories, felt obliged this summer to produce a factsheet debunking the principal claims. But it was only when the editor of a major environmental magazine sent me what he called “a remarkable essay” in the hope of persuading me to take up the cause that I decided I could ignore it no longer. The “remarkable essay” was garbage: a long series of disconnected facts tacked together to create what appears to be a coherent narrative, but that bears as much relationship to reality as a speech by Donald Trump. On a bad day. In my home town, the streets are now littered with graffiti advertising the website www.look-up.org.uk. So I looked it up. You might imagine, in reading what follows, that I’m picking an extreme example, but I’m sorry to say this is typical of the hundreds of sites promoting this nonsense. I keep meeting otherwise-intelligent people who seem prepared to believe it. Here are its main contentions: You can see the impacts everywhere. The authors of the website note that “virtually the entire month of November has been a ‘white out’… unbroken cloud characterised by a thin, translucent, white blanket of chemicals sprayed from aircraft.” Cloudy skies in November – hmmm, fishy to say the least. So why are “they” doing it? Well, it depends which part of this website you read. On some pages it claims that the contrails (or “chemtrails”) are being used to “manipulate the CO2 figures”. This will then justify the mass re-engineering of the atmosphere. On other pages, the contrails themselves are being used to re-engineer the atmosphere, using unspecified chemicals to change the weather. Who profits from this “financially motivated weather control” and how is left strangely vague, though of course the beneficiaries include “very well paid scientists”. Don’t they always? As everyone knows, scientists are rolling in money, which is why so many oil company executives leave to take up more lucrative careers as university lecturers. The scientists’ mysterious benefactors must be extremely powerful, however, as they engineered the Paris attacks (“another false flag event”), in order to leave nothing to chance during the climate talks. Everything confirms the thesis, even the dismal number of followers the site has managed to attract. That’s down to the role of Facebook – or Fakebook as they prefer to call it – in the conspiracy: “We hired some clever people to analyse the behaviour and reach of our posts and they concluded that algorithmic restriction had been put in place to restrict the reach of our posts to just a few people, a small group of subscribers, and it was normally the same people every time.” What other explanation could there be? And wait – it turns out that even the subscribers are in on it: “We also suspect some, if not all of those people are operatives who regularly like our material to ensure we think we were getting an audience, whereas almost nobody was seeing the material at all.” So on one hand we have a real threat, measurable and attestable, that is caused by an identifiable industry and persists as a result of the indifference and short-termism of the world’s governments. On the other, we have a conspiracy, attributed to forces unknown and interests unspecified, so powerful and pervasive that it extends from Mark Zuckerberg to the Paris terrorists. Why does it seem to be harder to generate interest in the real issue than the improbable one? The real issue – global warming caused by aircraft emissions – calls on us to act. Reducing our impacts means flying less; something that few people are prepared to do. It involves an exhausting battle against a powerful industry and unresponsive governments. It means reading boring papers, attending boring meetings and engaging with a level of political and technical complexity that many people find repulsive. There’s plenty of grind and precious little glory. But there’s nothing boring about conspiracy theories. They make sense of what can sometimes feel like a senseless world. They tell you that you are among the elect: aware of a grand scheme that other people (or sheeple or sleeple as the conspiracy sites often like to call them) are unable or unwilling to see. It tells you that you are a lonely crusader fighting evil of the kind that’s otherwise encountered only in films about superheroes. And if hardly anyone reads your website, it only goes to prove how important you are: why else would the authorities go to such lengths to limit your followers?  It also absolves you of the responsibility to act. Sure, you might feel moved to create a website, take some photos, perhaps sign the odd petition or even attend one or two noisy demonstrations. But you don’t have to change anything, because somewhere, buried deep in the forebrain, is the knowledge that there’s not really anything to change. You get the glory without the grind. Perhaps such movements are also a response to a sense of helplessness. In a world so complex, chaotic and badly governed that its most dangerous predicaments often seem intractable, it is paradoxically comforting to believe that godlike powers are in control, even if those powers are malign. We distance ourselves from uncomfortable realities by creating comfortable unrealities. And it doesn’t seem to matter how unreal they may become."
"India has emerged as a pivotal player in the climate talks, championing developing country demands that the rich take the lead in cutting emissions and providing more money for poor countries. But desperate for a strong deal to protect it from the ravages of climate change, it is also backing the US-led principle that all countries should act. Narendra Modi, prime minister of the country of 1.2 billion and the world’s third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, has so far taken the strongest line of all the developing country leaders in the talks.  He’s announced $30m (£20m) of investments in solar energy, and has also argued for a deal that would allow India to continue to grow its economy with coal and fossil fuels for many years.  “We hope advanced nations will assume ambitious targets and pursue them sincerely. It is not just a question of historical responsibility. They also have the most room to make the cuts and make the strongest impact,” Modi told nearly 150 heads of state on Monday. He added that a strong agreement was need on ‘loss and damage’, the idea that vulnerable countries be compensated for irreparable damage done by climate change that they did not cause “He wants a deal which will force rich countries to increase their commitments,” says a government spokesman. India is arguing that while all countries should work towards reducing emissions, those which industrialised first and whose emissions led to climate change, such as the US, Britain and Germany, should cut the most and help pay vulnerable countries to adapt. This, it says, is a non-negotiable, fundamental part of the UN’s framework convention on climate change and must not be dismantled. “We are not supporting any one prescription [for cuts] … On historical emissions we start in 1850. We are not singling out countries [for responsibility]. What individual countries do is to be decided by them. But the fact is that historical emissions have led to climate change,” said the spokesman. “Developing countries are trying to take action on their own, but their actions will fall short. It should be the responsibility of developed countries to step in.”  With industrialised countries in Paris reluctant to offer new money or to cede ground on loss and damage, India is certain to clash with the US and Europe over the next 10 days.  But India is not a deal breaker. It definitely wants a deal , according to negotiators from Africa and the least developed countries, who have been working with India.  Sanjay Vashist, a spokesman for Climate Action Network (CAN) South Asia, said: “Modi’s line reflects China’s situation 10 years ago. He is saying that developed countries are protecting their lifestyles while developing countries are negotiating for survival. There must be space for people to live a decent lifestyle too.  “To understand India’s position, you must realise that 300 million people live on under $1 a day and have no electricity, and that 700 million people depend on climate-sensitive monsoon-pattern agriculture.” “Only a a strong global deal can generate the finance to avert disaster,” said Joydeep Gupta, editor of India Climate Dialogue, a leading Indian analyst group. “It is trying to be a leader of the developing world. It has led the poor and vulnerable in these negotiations by making these demands.” Bill Hare, a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and founder of climate research group Climate Analytics, said: “I think India has some stark choices ahead of it. If it goes into coal, it will not contain its air pollution problems; if it goes into renewables, it will have a much better chance of a sustainable future. We’re seeing [in India] one of the fastest upscalings of renewables that have ever happened on the planet under way now but, on other hand, a huge lot of talk from the coal ministry about it [coal] being essential to India’s future. “One of the paradoxes of that situation is that India is a hotspot of future with very damaging impacts of climate change on vulnerable populations – there would [with climate change] be major reductions in agriculture production, huge increases in heatwaves, and flooding. India, has a major interest in the outcome of the world reducing emissions sufficiently to get below 2C. I think that’s a major challenge.” "
"A new paper was just published which provides a glimpse into the future of wildfires. The paper is titled “Extreme fire season in California: A glimpse into the future?” It was published as the second chapter of “Explaining Extreme Events of 2014” which is from by the American Meteorological Society and it is available here. The lead-in summary to the article is very much to the point. It states,  The fire season in northern California during 2014 was the second longest in terms of burned areas since 1996. An increase in fire risk in California is attributable to human-induced climate change.  The authors, Jin-Ho Yoon and colleagues make the point that California has been under drought conditions since 2012 and that the drought worsened recently. As is obvious, drought exacerbates the threat from wildfires. Last year, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection saw many more fires than have occurred in the prior five-year averages.  While the influence of drought and wildfires may be obvious, the authors bring some important and sometimes subtle insights. For instance, in a warming world, we also expect more rainfall. So it stands to reason that fires may actually decrease. So which effect wins out? The warming or the wetting? Also, how do the decreasing snowpack or early snowmelt factor in? The authors pursued their investigation by comparing satellite images from burned areas with a drought index. The drought index (Keetch-Byram Drought Index, or KBDI for short) is created from both observed and calculated daily precipitation and surface temperatures. In the investigated region of northern California, both the drought index and the regions of extreme fire risk have increased steadily since 1979. In both measures, 2014 was top for northern California, but also for the entire state. The authors also note that the two largest burned areas in northern California in the last 18 years occurred in 2012 and 2014.  The authors then project into the future and ask what the current trends portend over the next few centuries. The predicted results are striking. We can expect to see increases in the drought index, the area under extreme threat of fires, and the days of fire danger. The following statement from the report provides a great summary. The increase in extreme fire risk is expected within the coming decade to exceed that of natural variability and this serves as an indication that anthropogenic climate warming will likely play a significant role in influence California’s fire season. But, what we do now will affect how bad things get in the future. By taking actions like President Obama’s rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline, we can lower our threat to a more manageable level."

"Republican presidential candidates have poured scorn on Barack Obama for his comments at the Paris climate talks, with Mike Huckabee mocking him as the “meteorologist-in-chief” and Ted Cruz claiming Obama thinks “having an SUV in your driveway” is more dangerous than Isis. In a speech to more than 130 world leaders and other delegates at the key UN summit on Monday, the US president quoted Martin Luther King by saying “there is such a thing as being too late”.  “And when it comes to climate change, that hour is almost upon us,” the US president said. “But if we act here, if we act now, if we place our own short-term interests behind the air that our young people will breathe, and the food that they will eat, and the water that they will drink, and the hopes and dreams that sustain their lives, then we won’t be too late for them.” The threat of climate change “could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other”, he added. The president’s remarks were derided by Republicans, who accused him of failing to adequately recognise what they saw as the greater threat posed by Islamic militants. Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner in polls, said Obama’s speech was “one of the dumbest things I’ve ever seen, or perhaps most naive”. “I think one of the dumbest statements I’ve ever heard in politics, in the history of politics as I know it, which is pretty good, was Obama’s statement that our No 1 problem is global warming,” Trump, who disputes the mainstream scientific understanding that human activity is warming the planet, told CNN. Other Republicans vying for the party’s presidential nomination weighed in, with Texas senator Cruz telling a gathering in Iowa that Obama “apparently thinks having an SUV in your driveway is more dangerous than a bunch of terrorists trying to blow up the world”. Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas, tweeted along similar lines, calling Obama “clueless” and mocking him as “meteorologist-in-chief”. Not a joke: @POTUS thinks two-stroke engines & sunburns are a greater threat to America than Islamic terrorism. #ParisClimateConference Mitch McConnell, the US Senate majority leader, told the Senate that international leaders should be aware that there was more than one base of political power in the US and that Congress opposed Obama’s “regressive and likely illegal” regulations on power plants designed to slash their greenhouse gas emissions. “He’s currently trying to sell that power plan to world leaders in Paris as proof of the American government’s commitment to his energy priorities,” McConnell said. “But with all due respect to the president as our commander-in-chief, governments currently engaged in this round of climate talks will want to know that there is more than just an executive branch in our system of government.” McConnell raised the possibility of a Republican successor to Obama tearing up the power plant plan, claiming that the regulations “could result in the elimination of as many as a quarter of a million US jobs” without any significant impact upon world temperatures. As expected, Congress approved two motions on Tuesday to overturn Obama’s centrepiece emissions reduction policy, which uses the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce new limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The move is expected to be symbolic as Obama has promised to veto the bills.  The votes went largely along party lines, although 10 Republicans sided with Democrats to oppose a motion that blocked emissions limits on new power plants. Steve Scalise, Republican majority whip, said Obama’s plan means “unelected bureaucrats at the EPA will bring forth regulations that will kill jobs in the US and increase energy and other costs on hardworking taxpayers.” The staunch opposition of Republicans is in contrast to the urgency expressed by a succession of international leaders over the need to tackle climate change. Pope Francis added his voice to the political leaders on Monday, warning that the world was “at the limits of suicide” if nations did not ramp up efforts to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, the World Food Programme warned that unchecked climate change, linked to extreme weather and prolonged droughts, risked leaving millions of people without reliable access to food. Obama had a working dinner with the French president, François Hollande, on Monday before meeting with leaders from small island nations on Tuesday morning. The US president announced a $30m package to help the island nations, which are particularly vulnerable to sea level rises and extreme weather, improve their climate resilience."

"2C - it’s become shorthand for a safe, equitable climate deal. But the science and the UN’s position is unequivocal that if the world warms 2C above the pre-industrial age by 2100, many countries will face unbearable devastation. Of the 195 countries present at the UN climate conference in Paris, 106 of the poorest have said a target of 1.5C is the only acceptable pathway for humankind. The head of the UN’s climate process, Christiana Figueres, has also backed this goal. Despite the vast majority of media reporting, which suggests the overarching aim of the UN climate process is to reach a 2C target, the question is still very much alive. Negotiators in Paris met in a spin-off group on Monday night to discuss changing the long term goal to 1.5C.  This consensus-driven group is likely to deliver a final position by Friday. It is expected that wealthy countries will prevail in keeping the 2C target. A source close to the negotiations told the Guardian that on Tuesday a Saudi Arabian official had objected to the debate, saying: “I don’t think there is any scientific finding supporting 1.5C.” However a 2014 World Bank report, found the 1.5C target was “technically and economically feasible”. One of the co-authors of that report was Dr Bill Hare, founder and CEO of Climate Analytics. He said meeting this goal would require all action to be brought forward by a decade. This would cost roughly 50% more to achieve than 2C, but would save significantly more by averting some climate-related disasters.  Hare said the cuts to emissions required by this goal necessitated a revolution in the economy and particularly investment in disruptive technologies.  Such technologies, he said, are embodied by Tesla’s rapidly improving electric vehicles and batteries and the use of biofuels for aviation. If visionary engineering projects outstrip expectations (as solar has, something even Barack Obama noted on Tuesday), they could overthrow the current models. Very quickly the impossible becomes just very hard. Or, as the Guardian overheard one Paris observer put it: “If the low hanging fruit is out of reach, cut the bloody tree down.” The other overwhelmingly important step on the way to a 1.5C target is the load it will place on those countries who are set to emit the most over the coming decades – among those are India, Brazil and China. This has lead to divides in place of the traditional unity between developing nations. “You will see some resistance on the idea of 1.5 degrees [from China],” said Li Shuo, a campaigner with Greenpeace China, as the cuts required happen earlier and go deeper than the government is willing to concede. However Li said even the world’s biggest emitter was showing signs that it could turn on a fivepence. “Just two years ago if you asked anyone in Beijing whether they believed China’s coal consumption can decline this year, nobody would believe that,” he said. “It will decline further this year. So I think that created a lot of space for a very rapid U-turn of China’s emissions profile as well.” Some academics say that Hare’s reading of the models is overly optimistic and relies too heavily on technological solutions that do not yet exist. Bob Ward, policy and communications director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change in the UK, co-authored a paper as early as 2012 which concluded the 1.5C goal was already out of reach. “There may be theoretical pathways that involve steep emissions cuts and large negative emissions but they do not really seem feasible,” he said. Negative emissions rely on us sucking the carbon out of the atmosphere. One of the great hopes for this potentially game-changing technology is the capture and storage of carbon emissions from fuels derived from plants. This leads to a net loss of carbon from the atmosphere. The technology for this is still very much in a developmental phase, with no guarantee of long term viability.  Professor Kevin Anderson, deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, said negative emissions were being unwisely treated as a get out of jail free card. “There’s a lot of naive optimism around these negative emissions. To be thinking about the world just assuming it works is incredibly dangerous. And that’s what we’ve done now. We have normalised this technology that does not work, that we do not know about,” he said. Yet the debate persists. French president François Hollande said in his opening address to the conference that delegates should aim for “1.5C if possible”. At a press conference in Paris on Tuesday Obama said: “We want to get to 2C or even lower than that.” Adnan Amin, director-general of the International Renewable Energy Agency, said staying at 1.5C was technologically feasible, although “very hard”. “If we factor all the other elements like reforestation, it may be possible,” he said. “But it’s something that will require a level of political will that is currently non-existent.” This is the crux of the problem. Academics are interpreting models that are based, in part, on assumptions about the climate policies of 195 countries. This is where the scientists split into two entirely unscientific camps – optimists and pessimists. “I am perfectly happy to concede that one is entitled to be pessimistic. But that’s not a scientific statement,” said Hare. “The ultimate question is whether the politics is able to swing these shifts and right now no one really knows the answer to that.” Anderson concedes that the politics of the 1.5C target are still live and even backs the aspiration of the poorest nations to make it the target of the climate talks. “From a political point of view, one and a half is a really important dialogue and needs to be hammered home. Even though scientifically it’s not viable,” he said. But Hare said scientists also had a responsibility because pessimism would be self-fulfilling. “The more observers say it can’t be done, the less likely it is to be done. So scientists have an impact on the policy debate,” he said. The next two weeks in Paris are likely to give a degree of clarity about the biggest unknown – the politics. A target will probably be clarified. Although the open-ended nature of the proposed deal, which seeks countries to commit more in the coming years, will mean this wrangle will go on for a few years yet."
"The Prince of Wales is to give a speech on protecting forests as efforts to cut emissions from deforestation are discussed at the UN climate talks in Paris.  Experts warn agriculture, forestry and land use are responsible for almost a quarter of man-made greenhouse gas emissions, and action to tackle the problem is a key part of curbing climate change.   At the same time 1 billion people rely directly on forests for their livelihoods, while the rest of the world’s population need the clean air, rain systems and products they provide.  But each year approximately 12 million hectares of forest are destroyed, the UN warns, suggesting that if protected, forests could provide up to one third of the climate solution needed over the next two decades.  New action to protect tropical rainforests is set to be announced as part of the climate talks, which are being held in Paris in a bid to secure a new global deal to curb rising temperatures.  It is hoped action will build on the New York Declaration on Forests, launched at the UN organised climate summit in New York last year, which saw pledges to halve natural forest loss by 2020, end it by 2030 and restore forests and croplands of an area larger than India.  Charles will be joined at an event on forests at the talks by politicians and business leaders including Ollanta Humala, president of Peru, Marks & Spencer chief executive Marc Bolland and Marco Lambertini, president of WWF International.  It comes the day after more than 150 leaders gave speeches at the UN summit, which will see negotiators attempt over the next two weeks to hammer out a new deal to cut emissions, protect vulnerable countries from the impacts of rising temperatures and avoid “dangerous” climate change. Barack Obama said that in the wake of the barbaric Paris terrorist attacks the summit represented an “act of defiance”. He said that a future of negative climate impacts such as floods and forced migration “is one that we have the power to change – right here, right now.” “One of the enemies we will be fighting at this conference is cynicism – the notion that we can’t do anything about climate change,” he added. However, although world leaders were anxious to stress their solidarity with Paris and their support for the UN negotiations, tensions were also clearly visible. Vladimir Putin of Russia and Obama barely made eye contact on meeting, and in a private meeting with Obama, the Indian president Narendra Modi is understood to have made it clear he thinks developed countries should take on substantial carbon cuts while allowing poor nations to increase their emissions. While pledging India to protect the planet, and announcing new initiatives on solar power, Modi was adamant: “Climate change is not of our making. It is the result of global warming that came from an industrial age powered by fossil fuel.” Speaking shortly after Obama, China’s president Xi Jinping said the eyes of the world were on Paris and that, “tackling climate change is a shared mission for all mankind.” He reiterated the country’s pledge to peak its emissions by 2030 and said: “we have confidence and resolve to fulfil our commitments”."
"Hackers have leaked the private login details of nearly 1,415 officials at the UN climate talks in Paris in an apparent act of protest against arrests of activists in the city.  Anonymous, the hacktivist movement, hacked the website of the summit organisers, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and posted names, phone numbers, usernames, email addresses, and secret questions and answers onto an anonymous publishing site.  Anonymous claimed the attack was an act of protest against the arrest of protesters on a climate march in Paris on Sunday. Climate activists organising a peaceful protest say that the demonstration was hijacked by a small group of anarchists who clashed with police. All public protests have been banned in the city since a state of emergency was declared after the terror attacks nearly three weeks ago. Officials whose data has been leaked are from a range of countries including the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Peru, France, and the US. Employees of the British Council and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are among the British officials whose data is now in the public domain. “For the UNFCCC itself it’s embarrassing,” says Oliver Farnan, security researcher at the Cyber Security Network in Oxford University. “The specific attack that was used [an SQL injection attack] is a well-known vulnerability … To have their entire user database compromised in this way demonstrates a lack of focus on security,” he said. Farnan also said that the password encryption used by the UNFCCC appeared to be an “old and weak hashing algorithm,” that should have been “phased out”. However the damage is likely to limited, and mitigated by changing the passwords on any accounts that use similar passwords.  “Although it’s embarrassing, it’s essential to ensure that their users don’t get compromised in follow on attacks,” Farnan said."
"It seems odd to hold a climate change conference at a time of year when everyone has just looked out their window and notched the thermostat up by two degrees. Change seems such a mild word for what’s going on. When we say that someone has “changed”, we usually mean that they’re drinking a bit more or less. We don’t mean that they’re lying stone dead under five miles of ocean on a rock that now hangs silently in the freezing vault of space. An initiative was announced for a network of 120 countries to form a solar power grid, but I don’t think Scotland qualified. I’m not sure how much solar energy we produce, all I know is it’s way less than it takes to light a sky. Clean energy is always described as expensive and inefficient, but I suppose that if the price of the alternatives is extinction, we might just be measuring expense and efficiency wrongly.  The pope has said that Earth is nearing environmental “suicide”. Many leaders will question his right to speak on climate change – but to be fair, he’s the only one driving about in an electric van. Developing nations say that rich western countries aren’t doing enough to help them deal with the effects of climate change, but that’s not the case. We’re going to help them deal with drought by submerging them under the ocean. As the temperature increases some people say it will be like boiling a frog, but surely in that analogy the frog doesn’t know that the temperature is rising. Humanity is fully aware but possibly just too depressed to do anything. It’s more like boiling a recently divorced 45-year-old man. There could be a plus side to the ice caps melting. Think of the interesting things you find when you just defrost your freezer; we could discover the first ever entirely breadcrumbed mammoth. Pointing out that the Earth is our one home doesn’t seem to help. After all, a lot of us have got a room in our house that we gradually fill up with crap and can’t bear to go into. I suppose that’s just the developing world. There’s going to be a big rise in demand for electricity in the emergent nations. I guess spending 14 hours a day assembling our consumer goods was bound to put ideas in their heads. Many of you will be reading this on a tablet made by a Chinese teenager using rare metals that an African child has scraped off the side of a hill with a spoon, then sent halfway round the world to you so you can smugly talk about how little paper you now use. Recently, Richard Branson signed an “Earth Statement” the same week he launched a new Boeing. I would say, “How can he keep a straight face?” but his face has never been straight: he looks like someone cast a baboon in a movie about Rolf Harris. Maybe it’s time we started looking at being pro-business and pro-environment as opposites. They might pay someone to smile at the front desk, but corporations don’t care if we live or die. Perhaps it’s time to look at insentient blueprints for making money and wonder if they really have people’s best interests at heart. Can the market, a mechanism dedicated to increasing consumption, tackle a problem that is essentially down to excessive consumption? Why not – after all, we’ve all been down an actual market and heard those cries of: “Strawberries. Don’t buy these strawberries! You don’t really need them, you’ll throw most away when they go mouldy after you forget to eat them, don’t buy these strawberries!” Things will be terrible for the people who come after us. And they weren’t that great for the people who came before us either, as it was two degrees colder and there was no telly. Perhaps we’re all annoyed at climate change deniers because we know that the Earth is past the point of no return – we’re frustrated that they’re still at the denial stage of grief while we have moved on to bargaining. Things are so desperate that even our fictional dystopias may turn out to be fantasies. We imagine the Earth will sink gradually into chaos, but non-linear theories of global warming mean it might just be one afternoon of people screaming, then suddenly you disappear under a boiling, 100-mile-high wave of sewage flecked with famous landmarks from across the world; your mind finally silenced by the sudden arrival in the space previously occupied by your forehead of a shit-coloured Taj Mahal. In your final moments, you will probably feel cheated out of the many years you had hoped to spend watching a naked king in a leather crown as he staged mass hangings of poets in the echoing vaults of abandoned shopping malls. I dropped in to see my friend the other day, and her four-year-old daughter opened with: “The world is dying!” in a very sad voice. I said something soothing. I wish I could remember what it was now. Soon she’ll learn that, outside of the occasional Illuminati photo opportunity such as Paris, it’s not really the sort of thing we find polite to talk about."

"The heaviest rainfall in more than a century has caused massive flooding across the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, driving thousands of people from their homes, shutting down factories and paralysing the airport in the state capital, Chennai. The national weather office predicted three more days of torrential downpours in the state with a population of nearly 70 million people.   “There will be no respite,” Laxman Singh Rathore of the India Meteorological Department told reporters on Wednesday.  No deaths were reported in the latest floods, but since heavy rain set in on 12 November there have been 150 deaths in Tamil Nadu. More than 200 people were critically injured over the past 24 hours in Chennai, a senior home ministry official said.  The prime minister, Narendra Modi, has blamed climate change for the rain, injecting urgency into the debate at global climate talks in Paris and highlighting the vulnerability of tropical nations such as India to extreme weather.  Rupam Choudhury, a physician, said he and a friend had to wade through neck-deep water to reach high ground, where soldiers picked him up and brought him to his hospital in the heart of Chennai. The hospital was running out of oxygen for patients and diesel for generators, he said. Most mobile networks were down in the city and food supplies were running low.  Chennai is India’s fourth-largest city and a major car manufacturing and IT outsourcing hub. Airlines suspended flights into its flooded international airport, causing wider disruption to air travel.  “The biggest challenge is to find a way to clear the inundated airport and main roads,” said Anurag Gupta, from the National Disaster Management Authority in Delhi. Passengers stranded at the airport said they did not know when they would be able to fly, or where to stay if they could not.  “All of us here are getting agitated because none of the hotels nearby are vacant. Where do we go?” traveller Vinit Jain said.  In a limited initial relief effort, four helicopters dropped food, water and medicines, while fishing boats commandeered by the military were collecting stranded residents. A major relief effort by 5,000 soldiers was promised within 24 hours.  “The entire state machinery has collapsed. Most officials are forced to sit at home. It’s a very frustrating situation,” said a home ministry official, who requested anonymity.  Weather experts say the seasonal north-east monsoon is responsible for the flooding in the city of at least 6 million, which like many other parts of India lacks an adequate drainage system.  At least twice as much rain fell in the past 24 hours as the average for the whole month of December, the private weather forecaster Skymet said. Forecasters said the trough of low pressure bringing the rains was very slow moving.  Tamil Nadu is a major rice and sugar cane producing region, and a senior member of a local farmers’ association said floods had washed out up to four agricultural districts.  Modi has ordered rescue teams and paramilitary forces to launch an extensive relief and rescue operation in Chennai.  He had blamed climate change for the heavy rains that hit the southern state last month, tweeting before attending the UN climate summit in Paris this week: “We are feeling the impact of fast-paced climate change.”  Hundreds of divers and army rescue teams entered flooded homes, taking the injured to hospital. Authorities said more than a million people were affected by the flooding, with some residents bemoaning the slow response of the relief teams. Meteorologists had warned late last month that the remnants of Typhoon Marilyn, or In-fa, which had formed near the Philippines, could turn into a tropical depression and bring heavy rains to India’s east coast. Ramana Goda, 56, said his family was stuck in an area where three metres (10ft) of water covered some roads.  “The police want to help but there are no boats. We are trying not to panic,” said Goda, who took refuge at a police station after fleeing his home with his family overnight. "
"In huddles in corners, sitting on the floor in corridors, crowded around smartphones at cafe tables around the sprawling conference centre in Paris where crunch climate change talks are ongoing, a new form of meeting is taking place. These are the “informal informals” - groups of negotiators meeting outside the conventional apparatus of plenary sessions in large halls in order to facilitate a deal.  These meetings are intended to tease out and resolve the remaining differences over the detailed wording of the text of a possible Paris agreement. Often, they will work on a single paragraph at a time, reworking the wording and attempting to forge consensus in small groups that they can then feed into the larger process of negotiations. The informal informals are seen as a key - and novel - strand of the talks. In previous UN negotiations, proceedings have been hampered by the cumbersome process of presenting all 195 countries with long texts - sometimes scores or even hundreds of pages - every word of which must be approved by consensus. By allowing for these smaller, ad hoc meetings, the French hosts and the UN are hoping to lubricate the process of reaching an agreement. While these informal meetings are taking place, another strand of negotiators have broad oversight of the whole package of details that will make up any agreement, attempting to steer it through to a deal, and a third strand are working on some of the important issues that will make up the package, such as financial assistance for poor countries, commitments on greenhouse gas emissions, and mechanisms for ensuring countries are accountable for meeting their targets in a transparent way. Negotiators say that the French, who have put a massive diplomatic effort into the last year of preparations, are acutely aware of the risk that any agreement will be foiled not by a lack of political will to forge a deal, but by being bogged down in the unwieldy details of the text. That was a key problem at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, and the hosts are determined not to repeat the mistakes made there. The two weeks of talks, aimed at drawing up a new global agreement on greenhouse gas emissions that would kick in from 2020 when current commitments run out, kicked off formally on Monday. Negotiators met in back rooms while an unprecedented 150 world leaders took to the stage to emphasise their commitment to tackling global warming. In a sign of things to come, their initial meetings carried on late into the night, with some ending only at midnight. By this Thursday, they are expected to come up with a draft text that will be further refined on Friday, then examined by the French team over the weekend. On Monday, that text should be released again for the negotiations to continue - hopefully, with the removal many of the notorious “square brackets” which denote phrases or issues over which agreement has not been reached. At that point, the French will decide whether to entrust the ministers of each country with the task of coming to an agreement immediately, or demand further work from the facilitators before doing so. The process of UN talks was first developed in 1992, when the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed, and the emphasis is on consensus and transparency. This process can seem arcane and unwieldy, but the task of forging a lasting treaty on the climate among all world governments is so complex that little can be done to change it. Among the remaining unresolved issues at the talks are the proposed mechanism of five-yearly reviews after Paris, at which countries would be expected to take stock of their progress towards their emissions targets, and potentially ratchet up those targets if circumstances permit. Some countries which have set emissions targets for 2030 have reservations about the latter, though most are happy with the notion of a stock-taking exercise. This, and mechanisms for ensuring transparency and accountability in reaching emissions targets, along with the target of providing finance from the rich world to poor countries that will be most affected by climate change, are likely to be the subject of many formal meetings and “informal informals” in the coming days."

"Could drinking beer save the Great Barrier Reef? The unlikely marriage of hedonism and philanthropy seems quintessentially Australian. But the germ of this fledgling local “good beer movement” began a decade ago in Britain, where James Grugeon had his first inkling of opening a “social enterprise beer company”.  Grugeon’s first foray into social enterprise – the idea that a business performing a social or environmental good is as important as turning a profit – was working for a big UK government-funded outfit that helped households in energy poverty cut their power bills and household emissions. Extending the concept to one of the English-speaking world’s favourite diversions, drinking beer, seemed an obvious step to Grugeon. “I’ve been wanting to put up a social enterprise beer company for a very long time, as my friends and family, my wife will tell you,” he says. “I worked as an environmental activist campaigner, I worked in the private sector in corporate social responsibility roles, I was the manager for an NGO in the UK that did environmental protection stuff. “And it’s been for me a real no-brainer. You take something that everybody enjoys doing, like drinking beer, and you help them to raise money for charity at the same time.” But Grugeon’s ambition remained a beer without a cause until he settled last December in Brisbane. This was just as the health of Australia’s most famous natural wonder, the reef, was coming under increased scrutiny from Unesco amid controversial and ongoing moves to expand coal shipping through its waters. Thus, the Great Barrier Beer was born, and with it the local shoots of a concept already proven elsewhere in the world. Grugeon’s Good Beer Company will donate at least half the profits from its first brew to the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS), an organisation that has spent half a century campaigning to protect the reef. While there have been one-off charitable brews and social-enterprise bars, the company says it will be Australia’s first beer company with social enterprise at its core.  The brew is to be produced by Bagara Brewing company, a craft exponent based at Bundaberg, the southern gateway to the reef. At a launch in Brisbane last Wednesday, 250 guests were asked to choose the recipe, between an Australian blonde beer and a white IPA. The IPA edged it on the night. The production will be crowd-funded, with the campaign being launched on Tuesday. Grugeon hopes the campaign results in the first batches being in pubs within months.  Crowd funders will then be able to vote for new brews and new causes, prompting collaborations with other craft brewers across the country. With Australians turning in ever-larger numbers away from corporate brewers, Grugeon thinks the Great Barrier Beer is an idea whose time has come.  We meet in a craft brewery in the inner Brisbane suburb of Newstead, one of three within a stone’s throw, and with a crowd that trumps most pubs on a Friday night. “Drinking of the big brands, the XXXXs, the VBs, the Coopers, is going down and people are getting into craft beer,” Grugeon says. “There’s no better time to launch this in my opinion because if we can make it really easy for somebody to do something they’re already enjoying doing – and we can reinforce that thing that’s so important for people about their love of craft beer, which is it’s of their community – and we make it something that gives back as well then I’m very confident people will get behind it.” The reef was an obvious choice as a worthy cause, Grugeon says. He met AMCS campaigners while working to help set up the Brisbane office of activist group GetUp. This led to having a beer with novelist Tim Winton, an AMCS patron, who “loved the idea” of the Great Barrier Beer. Grugeon hopes the funds that flow from beer sales will help AMCS campaigners from being diverted from their core work on the reef.  “If we can scale this up, make it national and make it a really big success which I’m confident we can do, then there’s no reason why we can’t generate some really good income for them, which is going to help them to do the work that we want them to do protecting the Great Barrier Reef rather than spending a lot of time on the phone trying to find donors,” he says. AMCS chief executive Darren Kindleysides says any extra funding is a welcome prospect at a time when the reef is “at a crossroads”, its chief threat being warmer and more acidic oceans wrought by climate change, he says. “The government’s outlook report says the reef’s condition is poor and declining. One of the seven natural wonders of the world is still in the balance,” Kindleysides says. “The Great Barrier Reef is in our DNA. We formed 50 years ago this year and ran the very first campaign to protect the reef, against coral mining back then. Fifty years later we’re still campaigning on the reef.” Grugeon says the aim is to “scale up this good beer movement” to the point where it is creating “good sustainable income streams” for other charities. There is also a desire to influence the rest of the beer industry by promoting sustainable and environmentally responsible practices through “the whole cycle from its brewing to it being in front of you and me”. It is a righteous remit but the typical reaction to date is positive. “People I talk to are usually like, ‘So what you’re saying is, have a cold one, relax and I’ve just done some good work for the Great Barrier Reef?’” Grugeon says. “It’s just, good beer, doing good. Really simple.” • The Good Beer company’s crowd-funding campaign runs from 1 December via thegoodbeerco.com.au"
"The UN climate negotiations in Paris descended into recriminations on Thursday as China and two groups of developing countries accused the US and others of undermining trust and trying to evade responsibility for cutting emissions. With only one full day of negotiations left before a final text is due to be released by the French presidency for politicians to work on next week, the gaps between rich and poor countries remain wide. But diplomats have been quick to say that all sides can be expected to compromise significantly by the end of next week, and it is not unusual for countries to be so far apart at this stage of the talks.  Su Wei, China’s head of delegation, argued that rich countries like the US, Britain and Germany should not be allowed to evade responsibility for their historical emissions. “The basic facts do not change. The problem has been caused by developed countries. They need to take their historical responsibility into account and take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases”, he said. In a separate meeting, Nozipho Mxakato-Diseko, South Africa’s ambassador to the UN and chair of the G77 and China bloc of developing nations, said that “a small group” of rich countries that she would not name was trying to avoid negotiating a key financial deal.  “Finance must be negotiated. A specific group is not negotiating and is trying to change the terms of reference. Finance will make or break [the talks]. It is critical,” she said.  Developing countries say the principle of rich states taking the lead, which has been the cornerstone of the UN climate convention, is being eroded as the US and others press hard for all countries to act voluntarily according to their ability and without legal liability.  “There are attempts being made to redraft the convention. It is important we do not change the principles,” said Mxakato-Diseko. “New language is emerging that has nothing to do with the convention. It puts us in a precarious position. We do not understand what this language is and where it is coming from. It creates conditions which do not enhance trust,” she said.  “This group of countries feels free to waste time … with no sense of responsibility. The world should ask them what their responsibility is. They are ballooning the text yet we are being cast as the villains,” she said. But Mxakato-Diseko added: “We are mindful that at the end of the day we are going to have to meet our partners half way. It will be a process of give and take,” she said  The world’s 47 least developed countries (LDCs) said separately that there could be no final agreement in Paris if rich countries did not also accept responsibility for causing irreversible “loss and damage” to the environment. The US and Europe have so far refused to accept any liability, fearing that they would be left open to financial reparations. But Pa Ousman Jarju, the Gambian minister of the environment, speaking on behalf of the LDC group, said: “If loss and damage is not reflected adequately, there will be no agreement. It is a red line. “We were very encouraged by the world leaders when they came at the start of the meeting. We thought what they said would filter into the negotiations. We have not seen that yet. We have seen a lot of disagreement.” He accused rich countries of over-inflating the amount of money they have mobilised by classing money borrowed by poor countries to adapt to climate change as “climate finance” from rich countries.  “Finance is the bedrock of this agreement. It is through finance that the trust needed to reach agreement will be strengthened,” he said.  “It will be difficult to come to an agreement but not impossible,” said Giza Gaspar Martins, chair of the LDC group. “Painful choices need to be made at the political level”. The country that looks most likely to put a serious block on an agreement is India. With its massive population and stated commitment to use coal to raise its people from poverty, the country looms as the most difficult single challenge to those aiming to balance justice with a safe climate. The Greenpeace executive director, Kumi Naidoo, interceded on Thursday evening in an open letter to the Indian prime minister Narendra Modi. The floods currently drowning the city of Chennai, he said, were exacerbated by global warming. “Climate change was not made in India, but the price is being paid in India. Could the grounds for a solution now be laid by India? Could you, the political leader of nearly one-fifth of humanity, make history by securing a deal for the world?” asked Naidoo. The move comes against the backdrop of an Indian government crackdown on Greenpeace’s national branch, described as one of the biggest crises the global organisation has faced. But Naidoo was effusive with hope for Modi’s nationalist government to play a “heroic” role at the talks. He noted India’s leading role in the creation of the 120 country Solar Alliance, announced on Monday. “We stand with you in your demand for a deal that serves the interests of India and the wider world – and also for the people of Chennai. And we hope you will stand with the most vulnerable and help deliver success here in Paris by supporting 100% renewables for all by 2050,” said Naidoo."

"The aim of the political game in the Paris climate summit is to reduce global emissions while furthering one’s own interests at the expense of everyone else. There are around 20 negotiating groups, and the rules, which have been set by the rich countries, are bendable. But just as players move between clubs in the English Premier League, so countries at the UN climate talks switch between negotiating groups and make secret alliances. They can also belong to several groups at the same time. The game is played in two halves – the first week when the diplomats talk, the second when the politicians arrive (although not the world leaders who are only required for the anthems at the start of the match). As in football, money is no object for some teams.   In reality several teams can win and the whole world can lose. The referee is French and the match is nigh-on guaranteed to go to extra time. US Most like: Manchester United Arrogant, rich and powerful, the US team plays alone and scores even when not playing, at places like Kyoto. It has fantatical supporters but is a bully. May decline to pay weaker clubs the $100bn it promised them in 2009.  EUMost like: Chelsea This team of 28 extremely rich players negotiates as one, has great individuals but is widely disliked at home and has been in turmoil all season. It is unable to agree on a way forward and is now losing ground to everyone.  Basic group: India, China, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia and South AfricaMost like: Manchester City Thrusting, ambitious, fabulously wealthy world-class team seeking to dominate the league but often caught flat-footed at the end of play by the older teams who set the rules. Expects to do well this year.  Cartegena groupMost like: Arsenal A flash, medium-sized, rich team including Australia, Chile and Norway which has style but no world-class striker. Played a blinder at the Durban round of climate talks four years ago to save the game.  G77 and ChinaMost like: Liverpool Originally set up in 1964 with 77 players this is now by far the biggest team in the league with 132 players made up of developing nations from all over the world. Used to be all-powerful in the climate talks but these days it struggles to hold positions when its players defect to other teams near the end of the game.

"As the world gathers in Paris for the daunting task of switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy, one small country on the other side of the Atlantic is making that transition look childishly simple and affordable. In less than 10 years, Uruguay has slashed its carbon footprint without government subsidies or higher consumer costs, according to the country’s head of climate change policy, Ramón Méndez.  In fact, he says that now that renewables provide 94.5% of the country’s electricity, prices are lower than in the past relative to inflation. There are also fewer power cuts because a diverse energy mix means greater resilience to droughts. It was a very different story just 15 years ago. Back at the turn of the century oil accounted for 27% of Uruguay’s imports and a new pipeline was just about to begin supplying gas from Argentina.  Now the biggest item on import balance sheet is wind turbines, which fill the country’s ports on their way to installation.  Biomass and solar power have also been ramped up. Adding to existing hydropower, this means that renewables now account for 55% of the country’s overall energy mix (including transport fuel) compared with a global average share of 12%. Despite its relatively small population of just 3.4 million, Uruguay has earned a remarkable amount of global kudos in recent years. It enacted groundbreaking marijuana legalisation, pioneered stringent tobacco control, and introduced some of the most liberal policies in Latin America on abortion and same-sex marriage.  Now, it is being recognised for progress on decarbonising its economy. It has been praised by the World Bank and the Economic commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, and the WWF last year named Uruguay among its “Green Energy Leaders”, proclaiming: “The country is defining global trends in renewable energy investment.” Cementing that reputation, Méndez – formerly the country’s national director of energy – has gone to this week’s UN talks with one of the world’s most ambitious national pledges: an 88% cut in carbon emissions by 2017 compared with the average for 2009-13. There are no technological miracles involved, nuclear power is entirely absent from the mix, and no new hydroelectric power has been added for more than two decades. Instead, he says, the key to success is rather dull but encouragingly replicable: clear decision-making, a supportive regulatory environment and a strong partnership between the public and private sector. As a result, energy investment – mostly for renewables, but also liquid gas – in Uruguay over the past five years has surged to $7bn, or 15% of the country’s annual GDP. That is five times the average in Latin America and three times the global share recommended by climate economist Nicholas Stern.  “What we’ve learned is that renewables is just a financial business,” Méndez says. “The construction and maintenance costs are low, so as long as you give investors a secure environment, it is a very attractive.” The effects are apparent on Route 5 from Montevideo to the north. In less than 200 miles, you pass three agroindustrial plants running on biofuel and three windfarms. The biggest of them is the 115MW Peralta plant built and run by the German company, Enercon.  Its huge turbines – each 108 metres tall – tower over grasslands full of cattle and rhea birds.  Along with reliable wind – at an average of about 8mph – the main attraction for foreign investors like Enercon is a fixed price for 20 years that is guaranteed by the state utility. Because maintenance costs are low (just 10 staff) and stable, this guarantees a profit. As a result, foreign firms are lining up to secure windfarm contracts. The competition is pushing down bids, cutting electricity generating costs by more than 30% over the past three years. Christian Schaefer, supervising technician at Enercon said his company was hoping to expand and another German company Nordex is already building an even bigger plant further north along route five. Trucks carrying turbines, towers and blades are now a common sight on the country’s roads.  Compared to most other small countries with high proportions of renewables, the mix is diverse. While Paraguay, Bhutan and Lesotho rely almost solely on hydro and Iceland on geothermal, Uruguay has a spread that makes it more resilient to changes in the climate.  Windfarms such as Peralta now feed into hydropower plants so that dams can maintain their reservoirs longer after rainy seasons. According to Méndez, this has reduced vulnerability to drought by 70% – no small benefit considering a dry year used to cost the country nearly 2% of GDP. This is not the only benefit for the economy. “For three years we haven’t imported a single kilowatt hour,” Méndez says. “We used to be reliant on electricity imports from Argentina, but now we export to them. Last summer, we sold a third of our power generation to them.” There is still a lot to do. The transport sector still depends on oil (which accounts for 45% of the total energy mix). But industry – mostly agricultural processing – is now powered predominantly by biomass cogeneration plants. Méndez attributed Uruguay’s success to three key factors: credibility (a stable democracy that has never defaulted on its debts so it is attractive for long-term investments); helpful natural conditions (good wind, decent solar radiation and lots of biomass from agriculture); and strong public companies (which are a reliable partner for private firms and can work with the state to create an attractive operating environment). While not every country in the world can replicate this model, he said Uruguay had proved that renewables can reduce generation costs, can meet well over 90% of electricity demand without the back-up of coal or nuclear power plants, and the public and private sectors can work together effectively in this field. But, perhaps, the biggest lesson that Uruguay can provide to the delegates in Paris is the importance of strong decision-making. As has been the case at countless UN climate conferences, Uruguay was once paralysed by a seemingly endless and rancorous debate about energy policy.  All that changed when the government finally agreed on a long-term plan that drew cross-party support.  “We had to go through a crisis to reach this point. We spent 15 years in a bad place,” Méndez said. “But in 2008, we launched a long-term energy policy that covered everything … Finally we had clarity.” That new direction made possible the rapid transition that is now reaping rewards.  Uruguay gets 94.5% of its electricity from renewables. In addition to old hydropower plants, a hefty investment in wind, biomass and solar in recent years has raised the share of these sources in the total energy mix to 55%, compared with a global average of 12%, and about 20% in Europe. Costa Rica went a record 94 consecutive days earlier this year without using fossil fuel for electricity, thanks to a mix of about 78% hydropower, 12% geothermal and 10% wind. The government has set a target of 100% renewable energy by 2021. But transport remains dirty. Iceland has the advantage of being a nation of volcanoes, which has allowed it to tap geothermal sources of 85% of its heating and – with the assistance of hydropower – 100% of its electricity. This has made it the world’s largest green energy producer per capita. Paraguay has one huge hydropower dam at Itaipu, which supplies 90% of the country’s electricity.  Lesotho gets 100% of its electricity from a cascade of dams that have enough spare capacity to export power to South Africa.  Bhutan’s abundant hydropower resources generate a surplus of electricity that accounts for more than 40% of the country’s export earnings. But over-reliance on one source can be a problem. In the dry season, it has to import power from India. • This article was amended on 4 December 2015. An earlier version described Ramón Méndez as Uruguay’s national director of energy; he was formerly, but Olga Otegui now holds that post."
"As the nations of the world meet in Paris to address climate change, it is critical that women play a central role in these historic negotiations. Gender equality is central to effective climate action. The world cannot afford to neglect the needs of half the world’s population, nor ignore their talents and potential in innovating solutions. Structural and cultural disparities make women disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Women are more likely than men to die during and in the aftermath of natural disasters and climate change-related events. For the women who survive, many often lack legal assets and rights to property, which leaves them few resources with which to rebuild their lives. As women travel greater distances to collect essential resources like water, firewood and food to support their families, they are often threatened and abused.   Climate change has also contributed to high levels of displacement and forced migration due to environmental degradation and natural disasters. While migration can be a lifesaving tool for adaptation to climate change, forced migration often perpetuates and worsens the inequalities that women face. When male family members migrate, female members are often left to perform traditional roles as caregivers, in addition to becoming the sole breadwinner. When women must migrate, their economic and physical security is compromised, often leaving them to become targets for human traffickers and smugglers. The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security recently released a new study that examines climate change as a human rights imperative, global security threat and a pervasive strain on economic stability. The report highlights how women bear severe gendered impacts of climate change – including adverse health, economic, social and physical consequences – but systematically lack equal representation in decision-making.  The report also demonstrates – through a plethora of examples from around the world – that women are critical agents of change. Despite their vulnerabilities, women contribute to both adaptation and mitigation efforts in many parts of the world through creative, localized solutions. Numerous mediating institutions are working to provide women with opportunities to create their own sustainable businesses that also serve to reduce the global threat of climate change.  Consider Grameen Shakti, a renewable energy social enterprise that trains women as solar technicians. To date, more than 1,000 women have been fully trained in this program, and thousands more have played related roles in solar construction and installation. They have installed nearly 800,000 solar home units in Bangladesh, a country that is particularly vulnerable to the worst consequences of climate change.  Model programs, such as this, transform women’s lives by providing them access to sustainable livelihoods, while improving the lives of their customers and the broader community. Women are also working to combat the negative effects of deforestation. Women farmers in Iztapa, Guatemala have partnered with the International Reforestation Alliance (AIRES) to plant and farm trees, preventing soil erosion and promoting carbon sequestration. The women have planted more than 150,000 trees, contributing to the reforestation of the region’s mountain slopes, and have built more than 800 energy-efficient brick stoves, which use half the amount of firewood as traditional fires. Women’s access to training, technology and financial resources is essential to enhance their vital role in contributing to solutions. Perhaps more than any other global challenge, climate change reminds us both of our interdependence as well as the need for collaboration and meaningful participation. At the Paris climate talks and beyond, women must be included as leaders in decision-making positions within national delegations as well as representatives of multilateral agencies focused on climate change.  It is critical to ensure more open and consistent channels of communication between official negotiations addressing climate change and women leaders of civil society organizations who can relay the ground-truths. Women’s participation is not an option, but a strategic necessity. The language of the new agreement must recognize the gendered impacts of climate change, and also offer measures to strengthen women’s leadership through references in both perambulatory and operative clauses.  Delegates at the Paris conference should strive to build on the progress made in Doha at COP18, where significant progress towards gender equality was made. As world leaders decide how to commit resources to address climate change and its impacts, all financing arrangements should be gender-responsive. All too often, women are shortchanged in their vital efforts. Women have a right to meaningfully participate in efforts to address the broad spectrum of challenges posed by climate change; not only is it the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do for people and for the planet. Our health, livelihoods and the safeguarding of human rights – as well as our collective future – depend on nothing less."

"Malcolm Turnbull has pledged Australia will ratify the second stage of the Kyoto protocol – a move that underlines Australia’s change in attitude towards international climate talks but is unlikely to make any practical difference to reductions in emissions. Experts said formal ratification of Kyoto 2 – which includes Australia’s minimum target to reduce emissions by 5% by 2020 that the government says it is already on track to meet – would have a limited real world impact. But officials and long-term observers of the talks said the announcement sent a positive signal at the start of two weeks of talks in Paris that aim to clinch the next international climate deal, for reductions out to 2030. It was met with some applause from the conference floor. In a day of promises designed, in the words of the French president, François Hollande, to give the conference “a drive and ambition commensurate to the challenge” Turnbull also joined at the last minute a US initiative to double public and private research and development spending on clean energy technology, which in Australia’s case means an additional $100m in government spending over five years. And he announced that $1bn from Australia’s existing aid budget would be directed towards projects that reduce emissions or help countries adapt, including the $200m already committed by the Abbott government to the Green Climate Fund. The environment minister, Greg Hunt, said ratifying Kyoto 2 sent a “very, very powerful symbol to the world” and also helped Australia meet its minimum 5% target by “carrying over” the amount by which it exceeded a very lenient target under the first Kyoto agreement. Turnbull, speaking to the media after a sidelines meeting with Bill Gates, said he came to Paris “in a spirit of realistic optimism” and believed the meeting would result in a successful deal.  But he also said the government had no plans to increase its minimum 2020 target, even though it has inscribed tougher targets into the UN agreement under specific conditions that the independent Climate Change Authority says have been met. Turnbull was also equivocal about whether he would have to increase the longer term Abbott government target for the agreement being negotiated in Paris – to reduce emissions by between 26% and 28% compared with 2005 levels by 2030, saying that would depend on the ambition of the global community. Labor leader Bill Shorten, who is also in Paris, accused the government of coming with a message of hope but Tony Abbott’s old policies. “Ratifying Kyoto 2 is fine as far as it goes ... but it’s not exactly setting the world on fire,” he said. Labor has promised to consider a reduction of 45% by 2030, based on 2005 levels. He accused the government of “playing accounting games” by using existing aid funding for its $1bn climate financing promise. Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, said Australia’s promise to ratify Kyoto 2 was “largely incidental to this meeting, which is all about the next step after 2020”. But the veteran observer of international climate talks said it would underline what negotiators had already noticed – “a quite noticeable change in attitude and demeanour from Australia” in international climate talks. Erwin Jackson, the deputy chief executive of the Climate Institute, said the promise could have some tangible effects, including making it easier for Australian businesses to access international climate markets if Australia tightens the requirements of its Direct Action policy, and opening Australia to world pressure to move to the higher Kyoto 2 targets it had promised if other countries also acted – up to a 25% cut in emissions.  In his allotted speaking slot Turnbull delivered an international version of his domestic message of optimism and faith in innovation and technological advances. “From Australia we come with confidence and optimism,” he said, adding that Australia was confident the conference would “secure our future” because of our “great optimism and faith in humanity’s genius for invention”. World leaders brought both specific promises and persuasive rhetoric to the day of speed-speeches in two simultaneous sessions – with leaders’ attendance scheduled at the start of the conference to “turbocharge” talks, rather than at the end, as it was in the disastrous Copenhagen meeting in 2009. The recent Paris terrorist attacks were used by many as a rallying point – with the US president, Barack Obama, saying the meeting was an “act of defiance” and the attendance of so many leaders a “rejection of those who would tear down our world”. Obama cited his new research and development initiative – “Mission Innovation” –and foreshadowed a new spending promise for least developed nations including low-lying Pacific Islands. He told the meeting it could be the “turning point” in the world’s response to a threat that “could define the contours of this century more than any other”."

"Out past the floating villages, the daytrippers and the mangrove arcades, the brown waters of the Tahas river open into a vast, dull green lake fringed by forest and a seemingly endless horizon. Silhouetted by a sinking afternoon sun, distant figures fish from small boats under a blue sky streaked with low cloud. It is the kind of weather that both tourists and Savon Pen prefer.  “Sometimes you look up at the sky and it’s gloomy and I worry that the boat will capsize,” says the 42-year-old fisherwoman.  “The wind blows them over and when the boats sink, they go straight to the bottom of the water. Every year, people die.” Over the past few months, two people from her community have drowned. Tonlé Sap lake is many things to many people: a Unesco biosphere reserve since 1997; a wetland that supports the livelihoods of more than 1.2 million people; a tourist attraction; and the source of more than a third of all the protein eaten by Cambodia’s 15 million people. In the rainy season, its area can swell from about 2,700 sq km to 16,000 sq km. But to Savon Pen, the largest freshwater lake in south-east Asia is a treacherous but necessary workplace, one on which she and her husband depend to survive and to feed their six children. A good day’s work – which means spending 14 hours on the water to reach the far grounds where the fish are biggest – will net them between $8 (£5.30) and $16. From that, they will have to provide for their children, buy fuel and maintain the boat. “It’s very difficult because if we don’t catch fish, we can’t put food on the table for our children,” she says. “There are times when I have to take the risk and go out even though I know it’s dangerous.” Until three years ago, life around the lake was very different. Before then, much of the fishing was divided up into government-approved lots worked by commercial vessels, leaving many local people excluded. In March 2012, the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, ordered an end to the lots and opened up the waters to those living along its shores.  Although the move was well received by local communities, it has raised fears that unrestricted access could destroy fish stocks. In a bid to safeguard the lake’s population and diversity, an EU-funded programme has established a 200-hectare (494-acre) fish conservation area (FCA) close to the Kampong Phluk commune, which is home to nearly 3,900 people.  According to the local community fisheries, the FCA is paying dividends: its deputy chief claims that only 1% of the fishing in the area is illegal, compared with 30% across the whole commune. But despite its success, some local fisherfolk worry it may be too little, too late. Vey Kuang, who has lived in Kampong Phluk for all of her 54 years, says the fish population has dwindled drastically over the past 30 years. “When I was 18 or 19, there were a lot more fish than there are today,” she says.  “Back then, if we wanted to go fishing, four of us could catch the fish with our bare hands. There were a lot of tree branches in the water then to attract fish, but they have all gone now, so the fish population has decreased and some species are no longer found.” The forests surrounding the lake have been denuded for decades because people rely on wood and charcoal for fuel, but Vey Kuang believes that climate change is also affecting the seasons and the fish. “The weather is getting hotter and now even the rainy season is as hot as the dry season,” she says. “November is meant to be a cool month but this year, it’s hot.” Ning Nee, the community’s commerce chief, agrees: “We have seen an increase in heat. It’s hotter now and we are urging people to plant trees.” Vey Kuang has noticed other signs of climate change. She points to the water below the stern of the boat she is sitting on and says her mother has told her that, in her lifetime, the level of the lake has never been so low. What’s more, she adds, the lake has started to smell, which shouldn’t happen given the fresh downpours of the rainy season. “I hope the fish conservation area will help,” she says. “But I am very worried about how things will be for my grandchildren. If there are no more fish, we’ll have to send people from the community to the city and then the young people will go and we, the old people, will be left here selling fish and vegetables.” Others in the community are more ambivalent about the changing times and are eyeing ecotourism as a way to increase their income. Many already supplement their fishing activities by rowing tourists around their stilted houses and out into the lake.  Even the most vulnerable people in the village – single women without boats of their own – can earn a couple of dollars through the rotational scheme. Tourists are charged $5 for a small boat, of which $2 goes to the boat owner, $2 to the rower and $1 back to the community to fund conservation efforts.  Savon Pen is delighted at the extra income and unfazed by the tourists who cruise the river and study its people and wildlife through a camera lens. “I’m very happy to have my picture taken,” she says. “I hope they will share the pictures and then more people will come.” Although some of her neighbours fear that the changing weather could soon bring an end to a way of life that has endured for generations, and disperse families and communities, Savon Pen is resolutely unsentimental about the future. “If I could choose, I would quit fishing and do tourism. Tourism isn’t difficult – fishing is,” she says. “I’d like to live in a town because I’ve been there and I’ve seen that people there can support themselves in different ways and have time to celebrate holidays with their families.”"
"At the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 world leaders arrived at the end and could not save it from failure. In Paris, 150 leaders came at the beginning and were confident of success. That is partly because the negotiators have reset what qualifies as a success – and not just to allow the leaders to pat themselves on the back. They decided that, counter-intuitively, they might achieve more by demanding less. But the new plan comes with a risk.  For more than 20 years, the world has been struggling to tackle climate change, worried about the cost of acting but always knowing it would cost unthinkably more to leave the problem unattended. Now – in a deal to decide how far emissions are cut until 2030 – rather than horse-trading during the negotiations over what carbon cuts each country will offer, countries were allowed to pledge what they feel is a reasonable contribution to the accepted goal of limiting global warming to 2C. Those pledges are in. That in itself is a remarkable achievement and the job of the leaders in Paris was to give some momentum to the negotiations on the deal that will surround them. Leader after leader took to that task with passion in two simultaneous sessions on Monday that continued into the night to fit them all in. The US president, Barack Obama, came with a message of hope and urgency, saying climate change would “define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other”. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, set out the big steps his country had taken since its intransigent stance in 2009. Canada’s new premier, Justin Trudeau, declared that his country was “back”, in clear contrast to the less helpful attitude of his predecessor Stephen Harper.  The leaders of small island states pleaded, as they always do, for the world to think about what it felt like to face inundation. The Paris attacks were used as a rallying point. “Through our presence here today we show we are stronger than the terrorists,” the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, declared. Global leaders delivered the familiar warnings. “A political moment like this may not come again,” said the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. But even though the mood was optimistic and the words were full of purpose, the attention of the 40,000 assembled officials and media drifted a bit when each leader got down to the details of exactly what their country was actually doing – even at the beginning when there were still plenty of them watching. And that’s the danger. The pledges made so far will still result in global warming of at least 2.7 degrees, even if they are all met – much better than the 5C rise we might expect without action but still short of the 2C goal. Experience suggests there is a very big “if”, and negotiators have virtually given up on the idea that the pledges should be legally binding. Shirkers will face no real sanction, other than international opprobrium. And that means a system to check and report what each country does is critical. But the rules for monitoring remain unfinished. The plans to regularly review and ratchet up the pledges to contain global warming to 2C or lower are not finalised either and will be critical. Developing countries argue they still need more finance. Those details matter. Once the leaders are on their jets back home, sorting out the details will be the job of the same negotiators who have been talking about them for the past 21 years at scores and scores of these conferences. The same things will divide. The developed world will demand verifiable commitments from developing countries like China, India and Brazil – who over decades of talking have become, or are becoming, the world’s major emitters. And the developing world will demand money to help deal with the climate crisis. A weak agreement could still be hailed a success in two weeks’ time because the bar has been lowered and much of the work has already been done. But the real measure of success will be whether countries stick to and strengthen their commitments.  Only then will any deal match all the leaders’ first day rhetoric about really doing something this time. "

"India’s prime minister has launched an international solar alliance of over 120 countries with the French president, François Hollande, at the Paris COP21 climate summit.  Narendra Modi told a press conference that as fossil fuels put the planet in peril, hopes for future prosperity in the developing world now rest on bold initiatives. “Solar technology is evolving, costs are coming down and grid connectivity is improving,” he said. “The dream of universal access to clean energy is becoming more real. This will be the foundation of the new economy of the new century.” Modi described the solar alliance as “the sunrise of new hope, not just for clean energy but for villages and homes still in darkness, for mornings and evening filled with a clear view of the glory of the sun”. Earlier, France’s climate change ambassador, Laurence Tubiana, had called the group “a true game-changer”. While signatory nations mostly hail from the tropics, several European countries are also on board with the initiative, including France. Hollande described the project as climate justice in action, mobilising public finance from richer states to help deliver universal energy access.  “What we are putting in place is an avant garde of countries that believe in renewable energies,” he told a press conference in Paris. “What we are showing here is an illustration of the future Paris accord, as this initiative gives meaning to sharing technology and mobilising financial resources in an example of what we wish to do in the course of the climate conference.” The Indian government is investing an initial $30m (£20m) in setting up the alliance’s headquarters in India. The eventual goal is to raise $400m from membership fees, and international agencies. Companies involved in the project include Areva, Engie, Enel, HSBC France and Tata Steel. “It is very, very exciting to see India nailing its colours to the mast and providing leadership on this issue,” said James Watson, the director of SolarPower Europe, which represents the continents’ solar photovoltaic industry. “It will mean more opportunities for solar across the world and that can only be positive for combating climate change.”  The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, placed the initiative in the context of the body’s sustainable development goals, particularly a related target, set in 2011, of achieving universal access to sustainable energy by 2030. India has repeatedly said that it wants to use cheap solar to connect citizens who are currently without access to the electricity grid in remote and rural areas. “The idea is that larger markets and bigger volumes will lead to lower costs, making it possible to spur demand,” said Ajay Mathur, India’s senior negotiator and spokesperson at the Paris summit. “This bold effort could bring affordable solar power to tropical villages and communities worldwide,” said Jennifer Morgan, the director of the World Research Institute’s climate programme. India’s pledge to the Paris summit offered to draw 40% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. The country is projected to be the world’s most populous by then, with 1.45 billion people. Climate Action Tracker described the promise as being “at the least ambitious end of what would be a fair contribution”, and not consistent with meeting a 2C target.  But some see Modi as a clean energy enabler, having rapidly rolled out more than 900MW of solar energy across Gujarat when he was chief minister there. “India has emerged as the natural leader for this alliance, with its ambitious targets to install 175GW of renewable energy by 2022,” said Arunabha Ghosh, chief executive of the Council for Energy, Environment and Water in India. Modi’s announcement on Monday comes hot on the heels of a pledge by the US and 18 other countries to provide $20bn for clean energy research by 2020, a doubling of current funding commitments. A separate Breakthrough Energy Coalition, which will act as an investment platform for clean energy projects, is also being launched on Monday by Bill Gates and the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg.  On Sunday, Dubai announced a Dh100bn ($27bn) programme to make solar panels mandatory for all rooftop buildings by 2030, part of a plan to make the city a global clean energy centre.  Dubai aims to generate 25% of its energy from clean sources by 2030, rising to 75% by 2050.  The Indian initiative, called the International Agency for Solar Technologies and Applications (Iasta), aims to spread cheap solar technology across the globe with pooled policy knowledge.  “We share a collective ambition to undertake innovative and concerted efforts aimed at reducing the costs of financing and urgent technological deployment for competitive solar facilities throughout our country,” a membership statement by the alliance says.  It adds that the alliance will “pave the way for production technologies and storage of solar energy, adapted to the specific needs of our country”. "
" Russia’s environment has it rough. For close to a century, successive leaders have attempted to bend nature to their will in the drive for economic growth.  Under Stalin, planners tried to make Siberian rivers run south rather than north, Khrushchev dreamed of growing corn in the Arctic circle and attempts were made under Brezhnev to unlock tight oil using nuclear explosives.  Yet Russians hear relatively little about the treatment and exploitation of their own land, because of a lack of media coverage.  In a bid to improve environmental reporting in Russia, a group of journalists is attending a training project held to coincide with the UN climate change conference in Paris. But the participants won’t just report on the summit itself, says Nina Zakharkina-Berezner, who runs D’Est, the organisation behind the initiative. She hopes to open Russians’ eyes to the way environmental problems are reported elsewhere through a series of seminars and exchanges with leading journalists from Le Monde, Radio France Internationale and La Croix. Today, Russia’s economy has become increasingly dependent on fossil fuels, and the Kremlin has reacted to economic slowdown by cutting green subsidies. At the same time, the chance draw attention to abuses has been severely compromised, with Putin attacking NGOs which campaign to protect the natural world by branding many of them “foreign agents”. As Le Monde journalist Simon Roger notes, only “big stories make the national and international headlines” – such as the plan to build an oil pipeline near Lake Baikal, or to cut through Khimki forest for a new Moscow to St Petersburg road. One of the project’s participants, Nikita Kuzmin, has exposed the illegal felling of trees for the construction of mansions on the Curonian Spit, a narrow strip of land running from Kaliningrad to Klaipeda and a Unesco world heritage site.  Another, Maria Chernova, documented how illegal felling in Irkutsk province has been carried out with the connivance, if not wholesale approval, of the local police. “Any exposure is always a threat to corruption,” she says. But the ability of civic activists to cry foul in the face of environmental degradation has come under threat. Of the roughly 100 NGOs designated as “foreign agents” by the Russian Ministry of Justice, around 20 focus on the environment. Their aims are many and far reaching: they protect wild pacific salmon in Russia’s far east (Sakhalin Environment Watch), have brought successful legal challenges against illegal logging in the Altai mountains (Gebler Ecological Society) and protect the rights of people suffering the ill-effects of radiation (For Nature – Chelyabinsk). A report submitted to the Presidential Council on Civil Society and Human Rights in October noted that the number of NGOs operating in Russia since the foreign agent law took effect in 2012 has decreased by a third.  Official harassment does not end there. For over 15 years, Nadezhda Kutepova of Planet of Hopes had stood up for the rights of radiation victims in her closed city of Ozersk, Chelyabinsk province. But, this summer, she was forced to flee the country with her three children after the Rossiya-1 channel ran a documentary accusing her of “industrial espionage”.  Such persecution makes it all the more important that independent journalists can continue to work unimpeded and engage the public on environmental issues.  Despite the recent clampdown, reporters say environmental messages are slowly gaining traction in Russia. Angelina Davydova, a St Petersburg-based journalist who has been covering the beat since 2008, believes that they “have become far more important, both for the general public, and for the authorities and companies”, while she has witnessed “a growing number of civil society movements and initiatives”. One key to encouraging local interest in the environment, she said, is to focus on local disputes over recycling, green spaces or new factories.  “Often, environmental stories are [ones] of access to natural resources, of local groups fighting against a big investor exploiting local resources and not taking account of the externalities of a production process,” says Davydova, who is also head of the German-Russian Bureau of Environmental Information and a co-organiser of the project. The journalists remain hopeful that their reporting can make a difference, and say the slow instigation of much needed initiatives to mitigate against the effects of climate change show Russian authorities are not blind to the issue.  This year, St Petersburg approved an adaptation plan, which calls for better flood defences, and Davydova expects Moscow to follow suit, along with Kazan and Murmansk province. These measures come none too soon – particularly as Russia contains so much territory at extreme northern latitudes, where warming is faster than average."
"Barack Obama declared on Tuesday that some components to a global climate change agreement must carry legal force, easing one obstacle to a successful outcome at negotiations in Paris.  In an apparent compromise, Obama said the US would push for certain aspects of a climate change agreement to be legally binding – going some distance to meeting a key demand of the European Union and some developing countries.  However, Obama offered no change in the US position on the overall nature of the agreement sought at Paris. The US has been clear from the outset that it will not sign on to a full-fledged climate change treaty because it would have virtually no chance of passage through a Republican-controlled Congress. The US has also insisted that countries come up with their own targets for cutting emissions – and that these remain entirely voluntary.  On Tuesday, however, Obama said the US wanted one major component of the deal – the periodic review of emissions reductions targets – to be legally binding.  Such reviews are deemed necessary if countries are to achieve their agreed goal of limiting warming to 2C (3.6F).  The pledges so far would at best hold warming to 2.7C – which would still unleash catastrophic climate impacts on low-lying islands and poor countries.   “Although the targets themselves may not have the force of treaties, the process, the procedures that ensure transparency and periodic reviews, that needs to be legally binding. And that’s going to be critical in us having high ambitions and holding each other accountable,” Obama told reporters in Paris.  The US had earlier proposed a hybrid formula of a climate change agreement with some legally enforceable elements to try to overcome divisions about the nature of the climate change agreement being negotiated in Paris.  The European Union and developing countries have pushed for a legally binding agreement, such as the Kyoto protocol.  However, the US argues a legal treaty would be a no-go because of its domestic political circumstances. Congress failed to ratify the Kyoto protocol in the 1990s, and George W Bush eventually repudiated the agreement. Republicans in Congress have stepped up their rhetoric against what they called Obama’s “suspect climate agenda”. Lamar Smith, the chair of the house science, space and technology committee, told a hearing Obama and US government scientific agencies were misleading the American public and overstating the dangers of climate change. He also accused Obama of improperly avoiding congressional oversight of his policies. “The American people should be suspicious of this administration when it continually impedes congressional oversight of its extreme climate agenda,” Smith said.Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, also lashed out at Obama. “The president simply went around Congress to impose similarly regressive – and likely illegal – ‘power plan’ energy regulations anyway,” McConnell told reporters on Monday. “He’s currently trying to sell that power plan to world leaders in Paris as proof of the American government’s commitment to his energy priorities.” Hillary Clinton, running for the Democratic presidential nomination, hit back in an article for Time. She wrote: “The Republican deniers, defeatists and obstructionists should know – their cynical efforts will fail. Not only are they on the wrong side of science and of history, they are increasingly on the wrong side of their own voters, as a majority of Republicans accept the science of climate change, and support solutions like clean energy. “We must reject the false choice between combating climate change and fostering strong economic growth.” Obama’s statement in Paris came as the House science, space and technology committee heard from the controversial Danish economist, Bjorn Lomborg, who claimed that a climate deal at Paris would reduce warming by only fractions of a degree and would cost close to $2tn a year by 2030. His conclusions run counter to those of most economists and major international financial institutions such as the World Bank. Campaign groups meanwhile welcomed Obama’s remarks, especially his optimism that the international community would succeed in meeting its climate goals through technological advances in green energy. “It’s good to see the president support a long-term goal, but calling for the global economy to become low carbon over the course of the century falls short of what we need,” said Kumi Naidoo, director of Greenpeace. “To remain credible, he needs to support the vulnerable countries who have just called for all energy to be renewable energy by 2050.”  According to a New York Times/CBS News poll published on Monday 63% of Americans support the US signing up to a binding international agreement to curb the growth in carbon emissions. But a majority of Republicans in Congress deny the existence of climate change or oppose action on it. In the run-up to Paris, and while Obama has been at the summit, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly threatened to block climate aid to developing countries. Obama at his press conference on Tuesday dismissed such threats, saying the funds were already in the process of being allocated.  He also said that his climate legacy would survive after he leaves the White House at the end of his presidency next year. “Whoever is the next president of the United States if they come in and they suggest somehow that that global consensus – not just 99.5% of scientists and experts but 99.5% of world leaders – think this is really important I think the president of the United States is going to think this is really important.” Obama spoke only hours before the House of Representatives was due to vote to repeal the rules cutting carbon emissions from power plants that are the linchpin of the president’s climate plan. The White House has said it will veto any measure blocking the power plant rules, and Congress does not have the votes to overcome a veto. The Senate has already voted to repeal the climate rules.  The hybrid nature of a deal is critical to US thinking about how to counter domestic political pressure against signing on to a global climate deal. With that in mind, the Obama administration moved years ago to circumvent Congress by pressing for an agreement that would fall short of a legal treaty.  The strategy mirrors Obama’s efforts on the domestic political front, where – facing a wall of opposition in Congress – he has used his existing authority to cut greenhouse gas emissions.   The US was a major force behind the thinking underpinning the deal being negotiated in Paris, of a cut-what-you-can strategy, where countries volunteer their own emissions reductions targets.  So far, more than 180 countries have come out with climate plans ahead of the Paris meeting, which the US claims as a vindication of the voluntary strategy."
"As leaders start to thrash out the details of what could be a major agreement on climate change in Paris, they’ve been given an incendiary warning – a new song from Antony Hegarty, now recording under the name ANOHNI, that instantly earns its place in the pantheon of great musical protests. On releasing the track, Hegarty wrote on Facebook:  In solidarity with the climate conference in Paris,giving myself a good hard look,not my aspirations but my behaviors,revealing my insidious complicity.It’s a whole new world. Let’s be brave and tell the truth as much as we can. Its title, 4 Degrees, seems to allude to a rise in global temperature; twice the level that underpins the climate modelling at the conference, but the amount that Australian researchers predicted the world would reach by the year 2100. Hegarty sings an apocalyptic wishlist: “I want to hear the dogs crying for water / I want to see the fish go belly up in the sea / And all those lemurs and all those tiny creatures / I want to see them burn.” For the chorus, she shrugs: “It’s only four degrees”. One reading is that this is a persona, a kind of cartoonishly nasty oil baron. But much more interesting is the idea that this is Hegarty herself speaking, voicing a monumental act of self-laceration at her own “complicity”. Merely by living as she does, as all of us do with our air-freighted fruit and phone upgrades, Hegarty is willing death upon the planet. The song contains all our collective arrogance: we all wonder how much difference four degrees could really make, and assume that the world will weather our rapacity. She goes further still, voicing the ultimate taboo: that we revel in the exciting end-times madness of climate change, and even perhaps wrecked the world as a perverse declaration of our power over it. The song prickles with the shame of this idiocy. It is hugely affecting, its sledgehammer galvanised by the superb production by Hudson Mohawke and Oneohtrix Point Never. It’s a kind of modulation of the former producer’s Scud Books, but where his trademark horns were sexily macho on that track, that alpha male posturing is now repellent. By casting the apocalypse as uplifting and beautiful – even liberating – the horror is made all the more vivid. This is the charred flipside to Hegarty’s earlier masterpiece, Another World, a piano ballad that waved goodbye to the beautiful Earth: “I need another world / this one’s nearly gone... I’m going to miss the sea / going to miss the snow / going to miss the bees / miss the things that grow.” As a lament, it was heart-stopping, and yet 4 Degrees is more powerful still. It goes beyond mere sadness, and into guilt, and panic. This is a song that reminds us what is at stake in Paris, and how all of us have sleepwalked to the brink."

"Bara några minuter efter att jag har träffat kommunstyrelsens ordförande i staden som har utnämnt sig själv till Europas grönaste stad, står det klart varifrån han får mycket av sin inspiration. Det är inte bara det faktum att 61-årige Bo Frank har på sig en svart Beatles t-shirt och bär en Beatles-knapp på kavajslaget. När han visar in mig till sitt kontor på bottenvåningen i Växjö stadshus ser man memorabilia från popgruppen vart man än tittar. Där finns också fotografier av Sveriges kung och drottning, Barack Obama och en svartvit teckning av honom själv med långt hår och iklädd en blommig skjorta, från tiden då han först blev vald till kommunfullmäktige, för 41 år sedan.  De svallande lockarna är sedan länge borta, men Bo Frank har inte förlorat idealismen från sin Beatles-tid, när han nu styr denna lilla svenska stad (89000 invånare) mot att bli fossilbränslefri 2030 – ett mål som kommunfullmäktige under Franks ledning enades om redan 1991 och som man var den första staden i världen att göra. Bo Frank undertecknar sina e-mail med den sista raden av Beatleslåten ”The End” från Abbey-Road-skivan från 1969: ”The love you take is equal to the love you make” (Kärleken du tar motsvarar kärleken du ger) – och meningen står också på några av kommunfullmäktiges miljöbroschyrer. ”Varje medborgare måste bidra” förklarar han. ”Man kan inte bara skylla på andra och förvänta sig att de ska göra något. Man måste börja med sig själv: hur man handlar, hur man lever, hur man kör, hur man använder transporter, uppvärmning och el. Efterfrågan är mycket viktigt för att uppnå förändring”. Och förändringen har hittills varit imponerande. Förra året var koldioxidutsläppen per invånare 2,4 ton – bland de lägsta i Europa, och en minskning med 48 procent från när staden började mäta sina utsläpp 1993. Och man har lyckats med detta utan att offra tillväxten: mellan 1993 och 2012 ökade BNP per capita med 90 procent. I en BBC-dokumentär från 2007 kallades Växjö ”den grönaste staden i Europa”, och staden har uppenbarligen ansträngt sig hårt för att leva upp till lovorden – trots att det inte finns något officiellt sätt att jämföra städers ”grönhet” på. Danmarks huvudstad Köpenhamn, med koldioxidutsläpp på 2,8 ton per invånare, siktar nu på att överta Växjös plats och bli fossilfritt 2025 – men för tillfället ligger staden efter när det gäller energiomställningen. Bo Frank förklarar sin stads framgång med det faktum att inkomstskatten i Sverige går direkt till kommunfullmäktige som har stor handlingsfrihet över hur den spenderas, och de åtta politiska partierna, som spänner över hela det politiska spektrumet, har under årens lopp varit enade kring den gröna dagordningen. ”Vi debatterar inte ens ämnet på lokal nivå. Man kan säga att vi är åtta gröna partier”. När det gäller värme och elektricitet är Växjö redan nästan fossilfritt. Staden ligger mitt bland granskogar och sjöar i södra Sverige, och avfallsträ från skogen står för 90 procent av stadens uppvärmning och en fjärdedel av dess elektricitet, via en enorm kombinerad kyl-, värme- och elanläggning. Resten av Växjös elektricitet produceras i små lokala vattenverk, vindverk, biobränsleverk och solverk, samt med hjälp av import från Sveriges elnät, vilket till största delen produceras från vattenkraft och kärnkraft. Jag får en rundtur på Veab, kraftverket som ägs av staden, av vice ordförande i kommunstyrelsen, den ungdomliga Åsa Karlsson Björkmarker. Medan vi ser på hur väldiga lastbilar elegant tippar sin last av träflis, kommer jag att tänka på en annan Beatles-rad, som med en lokal twist blir: ”Isn´t it good, Swedish wood” (Visst är det bra, svensk trä?) Det har varit en mild höst i Sverige, men på vintern, då temperaturen kan sjunka till minus 10 grader, behövs det tre av dessa lastbilar i timmen för att hålla Växjö uppvärmt, förklarar Marianne Mattila, Veabs kundchef. Men till skillnad från biomassakraftverk i Storbritannien, som Dax, som får sitt trä från så avlägset håll som Kanada, så kommer Växjös lastbilar från inom en radie av 80 – 100 km från staden. Jag har aldrig varit helt övertygad det hållbara med biomassa – borde inte träden få stå kvar för att absorbera koldioxid, snarare än att avge det när de huggs ned och bränns för att bli energi? Marianne Mattila förklarar att Veab bara använder det resträ – grenar och toppar – av träden som går till lokala pappersfabriker, eller till Ikea för att användas till möbler (det näraliggande Älmhult – A:et i Ikea – är födelseorten och huvudsätet för företaget) [A:et i Ikea står för Agunnaryd, ö.a.] Annars kanske den biomassan skulle lämnas kvar att ruttna och avger då metangas som är en mycket kraftigare växthusgas än koldioxid, säger Marianne Mattila. I stället förs askan från det förbrända träet tillbaka till skogen och används som gödningsmedel. Jan Johansson, Växjös energichef som har anslutit till oss på rundturen, säger att det finns fler ekonomiska fördelar: “En av fördelarna är att biomassa är ett mycket billigare bränsle än fossila bränslen”. Trä brinner också rent, utan att avge svaveldioxid, och småpartiklar har betydelse, säger han. Och Veab, som har beställt en ny värmepanna i år, räknar med att dikväveoxidutsläppen också kommer att gå ned till noll. Som i de flesta skandinaviska städer är det centrala värmesystemet mycket energieffektivt och värmen levereras till Växjös bostäder och företag genom 400 kilometer rör som går under marken. När mark ska säljas till byggherrar kräver staden att man ansluter sig till fjärrvärmenätet. Så sent som i förra veckan vann Växjö en viktig seger när en domstol meddelade avslag i ett ärende där Konkurrensverket hade framställt att det skulle innebära brist på konkurrens att låsa fast 500 husköpare i ett nytt bostadsområde till en energileverantör. Senare, medan vi åt middag på en mysig ekologisk restaurang, förklarade Åsa Karlsson Björkmarker vikten av att staden vann den fajten. Växjö växer snabbt, 1100 människor flyttar in varje år, och staden erbjuder tillfälliga boenden för hundratals asylsökande från Syrien, Afghanistan och andra länder. Att kunna bygga ut fjärrvärmen för att möta kommande behov är avgörande för att kunna nå klimatmålen: ”Det finns inte något annat värmealternativ som någonsin skulle kunna mäta sig med så låga koldioxidutsläpp”. Den ökande befolkningen utgör också ett hinder i stadens kamp för att hålla nere utsläppen för transporter, som är den absolut största utmaningen för att nå ambitionen om ett fossilfritt samhälle. Av de 2,4 ton koldioxid som Växjös invånare släppte ut 2014, kom mer än två ton från transporter. Åsa Karlsson Björkmarker förklarar att staden sträcker sig över ett område på 30 km, och drar till sig arbetstagare som bor så långt som en timmes bilfärd bort. Alla kommunala bussar går på biogas från skogsavfall, men staden fokuserar på att utöka andelen cyklister, genom att bygga ut de redan nu omfattande cykelbanorna och gågatorna, för att minska fordonsanvändningen och främja elcyklar och elbilar. När Bo Frank kör runt mig nästa dag i en av stadens miljöbilar, återvänder han till Veab för att visa mig elstationen för elbilarna, som drivs av biogasanläggningen, och där taxichauffören Lars Göranson håller på att ladda sin nyligen levererade Tesla. ”Jag är så stolt över detta, det är lokalt producerat och miljövänligt” säger Frank. Nästa stopp är det kommunala daghemmet i den nya stadsdelen som heter Vikaholm, där de flesta av husen är byggda helt av trä och av passivhusstandard – så energisnåla att de hålls varma av de boendes kroppsvärme, till och med under den kallaste svenska vinter. Det är på förskolan som Växjö börjar forma sina framtida miljömedvetna medborgare. Från och med ett års ålder får de lära sig sopsortering, och under de många utflykterna i den närbelägda skogen får de lära sig att värdesätta naturen, berättar förskoleläraren Lena Rydell. Det är nu lunchtid, och när Bo Frank visar mig veckomenyn, förklarar han att 40 procent av all mat som serveras i kommunal verksamhet som daghem och sjukhus är ekologisk, och vegetarisk minst en gång i veckan. ”Jag hoppas kunna införa köttfria måndagar”, lägger han till. ”Paul McCartney har sagt att om alla slakterier skulle ha väggar av glas så skulle alla vara vegetarianer”. Jag är inte säker på om de här små människorna på Vikaholms daghem är med på hans resonemang. Varje onsdag får barnen rösta fram sina egna måltider, och de hugger in på pasta med köttfärssås, älsklingsrätten. Kocken Nathalie Johansson säger att de vegetariska rätterna främst är baserade på quorn, som fungerar som ställföreträdande kyckling. Jag ser andra tecken på motstånd mot Växjös centralt planerade gröna revolution under min 24 timmars vistelse i staden. En ung boende i en av lägenheterna i ett passivhus klagar på att man ibland måste öppna fönstret för att kyla av den. ”Vi har en termostat, men det verkar inte spela någon roll vad jag sätter den på”. Men överlag tror Bo Frank att Växjös invånare är stolta över stadens miljövänliga rykte, och han tänker tala mer för sin sak under kommande månads FN-konferens om klimatet i Paris, under lanseringen av ”Växjö-deklarationen”, en uppmaning till alla europeiska lokala myndigheter att bli fossilfria. Växjö var en av de grundande medlemmarna av Borgmästaravtalet, en sammanslutning av 6612 europeiska städer som har förpliktat sig att gå längre än EU när det gäller miljöskydd. Bo Frank har kära minnen från Beatles-eran och radikalismen på 1970-talet – men han är ännu mer exalterad inför den kommande miljödebatten, som han menar måste ledas av städerna. ”Under 70-talet var jag så pessimistisk. Jag kände inte ens att det fanns något liv efter 1984 [George Orwells dystopiska bok],” säger han. ”Men i dag är jag riktigt optimistisk. Vi har all kunskap om vad vi måste göra och vi har tekniken för att göra det. Allt handlar om att politikerna måste vara modiga nog att fatta beslut – och borgmästare gör ett bättre jobb än nationella regeringar när det gäller klimatskydd, eftersom de står närmare folket.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion"
"The Independent has revealed that Prince Charles demands a set of pre-conditions before giving television interviews. These include advance knowledge of questions, the right to monitor the editing process and also the right to block any unapproved broadcast. The heir to the throne expects broadcasters to sign a 15-page contract in advance of any interview, reports the Independent’s Ian Burrell.  A plan to interview the prince in Paris on Sunday by Jon Snow for Channel 4 News was cancelled because the programme’s producers refused to agree to the conditions. Other broadcasters appear to have agreed to his extraordinary list of draconian conditions in order to secure interviews with him. The contract amounts to a form of censorship. The Indy cites one unnamed source as saying that the degree of news control was reminiscent of North Korea. It will add, says the paper, “to controversy surrounding Prince Charles’s attempts to influence national debate.” It reminds readers of Charles’s “black spider” memos to ministers in which he sought to influence political decisions. These were finally published in June this year following a 10-year freedom of information battle by the Guardian. Now, with the revelation of the prince’s “access agreement” for broadcasters, comes further evidence of the way in which he seeks to avoid media accountability for his views. He clearly wishes to influence public opinion without the scrutiny that other public figures, notably politicians, must face. In a leading article, “The Prince of PR”, the Independent argued that “like all other commentators” Charles “should be open to journalists and, by proxy, the public scrutinising his opinions”. It said: “If Charles wants to play a role in the public debate - as he does over the importance of the Paris climate talks - he must play by the same rules as everybody else... It is inappropriate for an opinionated man such as he to be able not only to dictate the precise questions in advance, but also to pull his own material from the final cut if the programme does not satisfy him... Charles should think again. If he does not, the media should break royal protocol, and dare to report on him properly.” Well, I don’t see how anyone could possibly disagree with that. And if any broadcaster has signed Clarence House’s contract then it should be ashamed of itself.  As the Indy said, someone should remind Charles that Britain no longer has “an absolute monarchy.” Quite so."
"Many of the world’s companies pay no attention to how their supply chains are damaging forests, the Prince of Wales has warned as he urged action to stop deforestation. Speaking at the UN climate talks in Paris, Charles also called for large-scale restoration of forests, warning the world would need much more forest “as all the horrors” of global warming started to bite.  On the issue of saving the forests, he told a packed audience, which included the King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, that “there can be no room for failure”. Protecting forests from being cut down is a key part of tackling climate change, he said. “It is very simple: we must save our forests, for there is no Plan B to tackle climate change or many of the other critical challenges that face humanity without them,” he urged. While some companies had taken steps to transform their supply chains so they did not damage forests, he urged a redoubling of efforts to ensure a shift in global markets. “Encouraging though the progress made to date has been, it remains the case that many of the world’s largest companies - and their financial backers - pay scant, by which I really mean no, attention to the deforestation footprint of their supply chains.” This was especially true in markets with limited pressure from consumers to do the right thing, he said. All companies should be committed to stopping destruction of forests, with zero net deforestation becoming the norm rather than the exception, he urged. The prince was speaking at an event at the UN climate talks, where 195 countries are attempting to hammer out a deal to help prevent global temperatures rising more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.  Preventing the destruction and degradation of forests is a key part of tackling climate change, as the UN estimates the loss of around 12 million hectares a year is responsible for around 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions.  Charles also called for action to to bring about large scale forest landscape restoration, pointing to the need for such a move in the face of the loss of 500 million hectares (1.2 billion acres) of tropical rainforest since 1950.  It should be an equal priority to halting deforestation, not an afterthought, he said. And he warned: “As all the horrors of even a 2C warmer world bite - and bite they will - we are going to need a lot more forest, not a slight reduction in the existing rate of attrition.”  As well playing a key role in carbon storage and climate change, the world’s forests are directly relied on by around one billion people for their livelihoods, while everyone relies on services they provide such as regulating rainfall and supplying commodities.  Charles called for support for indigenous communities and those who live in or alongside forests. “All our efforts should in the first instance be guided by the people whose lives are so much more intimately intertwined with the forests than our own; and that the approaches we take should both recognise and protect their rights, and draw on their wisdom, their perspectives and, of course, their hopes for the future,” he urged.  At the start of the two-week conference, leaders from 20 countries including the UK and major forest nations such as Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, put out a joint statement recognising the “essential” role forests play in protecting the planet and avoiding dangerous climate change.  “We are committed to intensifying efforts to protect forests, to significantly restore degraded forest, peat and agricultural lands, and to promote low-carbon rural development,” they said.  A number of new initiatives have been announced, including a partnership by Colombia with Germany, Norway and the UK to back the Latin American country’s efforts towards green growth and to reduce deforestation in the Amazon.  The UK has also announced an aim with Germany and Norway to provide $5bn by 2020 to countries if they pursue ambitious schemes to cut deforestation and degradation, improve sustainable management, conservation and carbon stocks in forests.  The move forms part of a climate programme, known as Redd+, to provide financial incentives for developing countries to protect their forests by putting a value to their carbon stores and other natural benefits.  In his speech, the Prince of Wales said he was “heartened” to see the focus at the climate talks on supporting forest conservation, but said international frameworks could give even more consideration to the role of forests and land use in both cutting climate change emissions and coping with its effects.

"People ride a bike for all sorts of reasons: they’re fun; they keep you fit; in congested cities they have an amazing ability to deliver you to your destination on time. But what about saving the planet? That’s a tricky one. While cyclists face occasional taunts about being smug, self-righteous eco-warriors, in truth environmental considerations tend to be lower down on their lists of reasons to ride. But for governments it should be a different matter altogether.  As the great and good gather in Paris for climate change talks, it’s time to consider what role the humble bike can play in combating global warming. Amid all the talk about the prosperity of developing nations and China’s coal addiction, bikes might seem a bit trivial, and will likely get little mention at the summit. But this is unfair. Transport is a major contributor to overall greenhouse gas emissions – in most nations the second-biggest element after energy generation. In the EU, road transport alone makes up about 20% of all emissions, and unlike for most other sectors it is still tending to rise. Obviously, not every single road journey can be made on a bike. But a lot could. Across Europe, half of all car trips are less than three miles, a distance most people could happily cycle in about 20 minutes. The rise of the e-bike means such trips are more possible even for older people, or those living in a hilly area. So if, hypothetically, every nation set about building a Dutch or Danish style network of bike infrastructure and took other measures to encourage people on to two wheels, what would it do for emissions? One of the most exhaustive studies was carried out by the European Cycling Federation (ECF) in 2011. This began by trying to compare the average emissions for bikes and e-bikes with other forms of transport, calculating both the environmental cost of manufacture and of use, which for ordinary bikes included extra calories consumed. Even with an assumption of the average bike weighing a hefty near-20kg, the study came up with an emissions rate for ordinary bikes of 21 grams of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) per kilometre travelled. For e-bikes, the figure was barely more, at 22g/km. In contrast, the emissions for a car were 271g/km per person, and 101g/km for bus passengers. Overall, the ECF study calculated that if all the EU’s nations achieved Danish levels of cycling this alone would account for between 5% and 11% of the emissions reductions needed to reach the EU’s official 2020 emissions targets, and would be between 57% and 125% of the reduction needed in transport emissions. A similar study came out last week, from the New York-based Institute for Transportation and Development Policy and the University of California, Davis. This found that even e-bikes can often prove more energy efficient per passenger-kilometre than many rail systems. It concluded that a not-too-outrageous upshift in global cycling use – from a current 6% or so of all urban passenger miles to 11% in 2030 and 14% in 2050 – would cut overall emissions by 7% (in 2030) and then 11% (in 2050). To an extent, all this is pretty well known. So, given David Cameron was to tell the opening of the climate summit that he is “serious about decarbonising”, is his government pressing ahead with pro-cycling policies? No. For all Cameron’s call for a “cycling revolution”, last week’s autumn statement laid out precisely £300m in cycling investment in the five years from 2015/16. That’s £60m a year, or around £1 per person (outside London, where spending is higher), against a Dutch equivalent of about £20. That £300m would get you about a mile-and-a-half of Crossrail, or about two miles of HS2. In contrast, the Department for Transport announced on Monday the initial phase of what is known as road investment strategy 2, or RIS2, a successor to RIS1, which devoted £15.2bn to road schemes between 2015 and 2020. Of course, many more people currently drive than cycle, and RIS2 will tackle motorways and trunk roads, not urban streets. But it illustrates a general approach of planning for a road-dominated future, one where transport-based greenhouse gas emissions will, inevitably, remain high. It’s worth noting that even if everyone suddenly switched to electric cars overnight – unlikely, given they currently make up just over 20,000 of the 2.2m UK new car sales a year – the emissions involved in making them, and their extra weight, would still make them greatly less efficient than bikes. It’s one of the curious paradoxes of bikes in the modern world, that this largely low-tech device – if you exclude e-bikes the fundamentals have stayed broadly similar for 130 years – is so beautifully suited as a solution to the very modern problem of global warming. And yet so little is being done. It speaks eloquently of a failure of imagination, of ambition, of will, of vision among the politicians gathered in Paris. And that doesn’t fill me with optimism about the talks."
"The Copenhagen climate summit in 2009 contributed to the demise of Kevin Rudd’s first prime ministership. But Rudd, back for the Paris summit of 2015, insists Copenhagen wasn’t quite the failure it was made out to be. He says his views on global warming haven’t changed and that unlike other, unnamed, colleagues from his time in office, his attendance in Paris proves that his interest in the issue of global warming has not wavered.   “I am a believer in climate change action. Let me say it again in print, I believe it is the greatest moral challenge of our age,” he says in an interview with Guardian Australia. “My position hasn’t changed on that, nor will it change. The reasons I am here, supporting this process today when very few of my colleagues of five or six years ago are here, is because I attach great importance to this. That is why I continue to work on climate change projects with the world’s largest polluters in China and India,” says Rudd, now the president of the New York-based Asia Society Policy Institute. Rudd invested enormous effort in the diplomatic efforts before and during the Copenhagen talks, and afterwards colleagues said he fell into a “slump”, missing the window of opportunity to call a double-dissolution election on his defeated emissions trading scheme at a time when the polls said he would have easily beaten the new opposition leader, Tony Abbott. Now Rudd insists the Copenhagen talks provided an important stepping stone to the current negotiations and will be viewed more positively by history than they are now, even though they were clearly a political failure. “If you read this draft Paris accord, its essential architecture is what was contained in the Copenhagen accord,” he says. Copenhagen, he says, “stands up well as a major policy building block to where we are now. But in terms of the political stage management of Copenhagen, everyone knows that was a spectacular disaster.” Like most observers in Paris he identifies India’s insistence that it needs to continue to use coal-fired power, and that its development needs cannot be compromised, as the major potential stumbling block in the Paris talks, which are scheduled to last two weeks. “In Copenhagen, both China and India were not supportive of a globally binding arrangement and sought to reduce it to a de minimis outcome.  “The remarkable thing is there has been a 180-degree shift in the Chinese position since Copenhagen. The big question is now India’s position. The Indian industrial development curve is 30 years behind China and the most carbon-intensive part of India’s industrial development has yet to begin.  “So if we are serious about having India on board and India acting in a manner different to the China carbon explosion of the last 30 years, then this conference has to make clear how it will help India with its own rapid transformation of its energy mix.” On Malcolm Turnbull, Rudd says his discussions in diplomatic circles indicate “the jury is out” about the new Coalition leader. “People are looking and hoping, but suspending judgment for a while. There is a palpable sense of relief that Abbott is no longer directing climate change policy, not just because of his position that climate change is absolute crap but also his general hostility to multilateralism. But there is also a genuine suspending of judgment about Turnbull,” he says, arguing that in the end there will be factual evidence available as to whether the Coalition’s carbon policies are working. He says he attended Turnbull’s address to the UN summit on Monday as “the respectful thing to do”, sitting with the prime minister of Papua New Guinea. “I appropriately applauded when Malcolm announced Australia would ratify the second Kyoto commitment period. Ratifying Kyoto is useful as a baseline to Australia’s commitment to multilateral action.”"
"The official sherpas and their political masters preparing for the global climate change talks in Paris which start today, have their already complicated task beset further by concerns over security, following the appalling attacks in Paris on Friday 13th November. Beyond questions of security, the attacks are likely to have much broader impacts on the climate change talks, which are a make or break moment in the effort to prevent runaway global warming. Politics and diplomacy have a long track record of being shaped by events, which open or close windows of political possibility. In the UK, the shock of the first world war helped create the political will to pass universal suffrage, while the second world war created a state of mind in the United Kingdom which made a welfare state possible.  In recent years, terrorist attacks have played significant roles as drivers of change. In 2001, the 9/11 attacks galvanised a dormant attempt to launch a global round of trade talks. I was in Qatar six weeks after the attack on New York’s twin towers, and watched as world leaders swallowed their differences in a collective determination to show that the international community could come together in the face of atrocity, launching the Doha round of WTO trade negotiations. Four years later, the British government and Make Poverty History campaigners put debt relief and aid on the agenda of the G8 summit at Gleneagles in July 2005, but it was the 7/7 London bombings in the middle of the summit that made it diplomatically inevitable that the other G8 leaders would throw Blair a bone in the form of an ambitious agreement on aid and debt (pdf).  In Paris in the weeks to come, there will be an equal determination to close ranks and give President Hollande a much-needed diplomatic victory. The President has already set the tone by telling a joint session of the French parliament that the conference would go ahead, to “show that the world must stay united against terrorism.” President Barack Obama will still speak in person at the beginning of the conference. With that kind of political momentum, the window is now open for a more ambitious climate change agreement than might otherwise have been possible.  After the attacks, the language around the impending Conference of the Parties will undoubtedly be full of the need for a moment of global solidarity, moving on from the tit-for-tat horse trading that has typified international climate negotiations to mutual cooperation between governments to tackle what Lord Stern called: “the biggest collective action problem in history.” But the lesson of 9/11 and Doha is that the new momentum behind a deal could be a double-edged sword. There, pressure was piled on developing countries to dilute their demands in the interests of standing up to terrorism. The trade talks soon slid back into the mire as North-South differences resurfaced.  There is a risk that a similar lowest common denominator deal could be agreed in Paris by negotiators understandably keen to grab diplomatic victory and jump on the first plane home. That would be a terrible missed opportunity, because the tide of events on climate change is already heading in the right direction – since failure in Copenhagen in 2009, developing and developed countries have got on board, the scientific consensus around the need for action has grown even stronger, and new technologies have made the inevitable carbon transition less painful.  Leadership, public pressure and not a little luck will be needed to make sure that Paris produces a deal worthy both of the moment and the climate challenge that faces us all.

"As the world puts its hope in the Paris UN climate change conference to bring real sustainable change to the future of our planet, Guardian Australia is pleased to announce the launch of Guardian Sustainable Business (GSB) in Australia.  Businesses, alongside governments and citizens, will lead the way towards a more equitable, sustainable future. Along with our UK and US counterparts, GSB Australia will investigate the social and environmental impact of business in Australia.  To ensure we know about the most important sustainability issues, we asked Australia’s top thought leaders and change-makers in this area to form an advisory council. The members include Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, Climate Council’s Amanda McKenzie, Social Ventures Australia’s Michael Traill, Sustainable Business Australia’s Andrew Petersen, Diversity Council Australia’s Lisa Annese, WWF’s Dermot O’Gorman, 350.org’s Blair Palese, Greenpeace’s David Ritter, Beyond Zero Emissions’ Dr Stephen Bygrave, BLabs Australia’s Alicia Darvall, Australian Youth Climate Coalition’s Amelia Telford, Earth Hour’s Anna Rose, Do Something! Jon Dee, Professor Stuart White, the Director of the Institute for Sustainable Futures’ and Professor John Thwaites of Monash Sustainability Institute & ClimateWorks Australia. We asked these members to nominate the issue they consider the most pressing. Here is a selection of their thoughts. Clover Moore, Lord Mayor, City of Sydney Our cities have become one of the crucial battlegrounds in the fight against climate change. They cover just 2% of the earth’s surface, but contain over half the world’s population – even more here in Australia – and cities generate 75% to 80% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. That’s why in Paris, city leaders will be part of the discussion for the first time at a UN climate conference. It’s vital we demonstrate the pivotal role cities can play in reducing global emissions. Our experience in Sydney is that you can deliver on ambitious emissions reductions targets without compromising economic growth. We have the most ambitious target of any Australian government – to cut emissions 70% by 2030, on 2006 levels – and we’re well on track. And those targets have been matched by strong growth and an unprecedented construction boom. Indeed 40% of new jobs in greater Sydney in the five years to 2012 were created in our local government area, and $3.9bn of new development was approved last year. Our Better Buildings Partnership brings together the owners of more than half of the city centre’s commercial-floor space in a group that works collaboratively to reduce emissions. So far, the program has reduced emissions in these buildings by 35%, reducing their energy bills by $30m a year. The City’s residential apartment plan, on the other hand, outlines a suite of simple measures to reduce the environmental impact of apartment living – applicable to over two thirds of the city’s population. And our climate adaptation strategy, which was prepared with help from major science groups and leading business and property organisations, contains 39 actions to deal with issues ranging from changing rainfall patterns and rising sea levels to more severe heat waves. The uncomfortable truth is that the slow response to this urgent threat means some climate change is now inevitable. But we must not waver from the common goal of limiting a global temperature rise to 2 degrees. Cities are where these national commitments will turn from words to action. David Ritter, CEO, Greenpeace Australia Almost 30 years since Paul Keating’s “Banana Republic” speech, Australia faces another vital moment of economic transformation arising from the greatest sustainability issue of our time. The coal industry – soon to be followed by oil and gas – must be swept into the dustbin of economic history. And clearly, things are rapidly changing. According to Goldman Sachs coal is in decline and will never come back. The collapse of coal is to be celebrated. Coal is the single largest global driver of climate change and the CO2 generated when Australian export coal is burned overseas is our biggest source of emissions. According to the Climate Council (pdf), 90% of Australia’s current coal reserves will need to be left in the ground if global warming is to be kept to no more than 2C. But the demise of coal raises profound questions around how we handle the change. It is essential that the transformation in our economy is managed justly and fairly. Good new jobs must be found for coal workers. Coal communities must be economically supported in transition. Genuine alternatives must be found for traditional owners who may have been relying on coal for revenue streams. Low-carbon economic alternatives must receive appropriate government support. But underlying all these practical measures must be an exercise in truth-telling. The Abbott government was particularly egregious in its ludicrous worship of coal as good for humanity. But no Australian state or federal government has as yet been honest with the Australian people and spoken the truth: that the days of coal are over. An absurd political charade persists; somehow Australia is going to have a coal industry and the world is going to tackle climate change. The problem is political economy. The fossil fuel mining industry has too much influence over Australian politics. Astonishingly, the Australian government still provides $1.8bn in production subsidies to the coal mining industry every year. According to the IMF, Australia provides fossil fuel subsidies equivalent to $1,712 per person per year, or around $40bn a year. Bizarrely, despite the downward spiral of coal, new mine proposals such as Carmichael and Shenhua Watermark, remain in play. The reign of coal is over. It is time for our political leaders to do their job and to call it and to bring on the reforms to match the necessary reality. Blair Palese, CEO, 350.org Australia The end of coal is not a radical, future idea but a reality already upon us. Scientists tell us that if we want a liveable planet in the future, we must keep 80% of fossil fuel reserves in the ground. That’s why Australia’s need for a rapid and well-planned transition from fossil fuels and out-of-date power plants to clean energy is our most critical sustainable development issue. It’s high time to end the divisive political rhetoric and to set a progressive action to make the move. As other countries have moved to rapidly take up renewable energy such as solar and wind, Australia has turned climate change into a political football and largely opted out. Despite being a solar energy dream nation, our entrenched leaders have ignored and even blocked renewable energy development and tied itself to polluting king coal. We are now a nation playing “catch up” in an industry experiencing exponential growth and evolution. This week the Climate Council of Australia released a report (pdf) showing that global clean energy investment has grown by 43% with 7.7m new jobs created in the industry worldwide, nearly doubling renewable energy job numbers since 2009. China’s renewable energy investments have increased by 32% from last year, adding 1.2m more jobs to their economy. In the US, investment is up by 8% and with a jump of 31,000 new jobs created since 2013. By comparison, Australia’s investment in renewable energy has dropped by 35% to its lowest level since 2009. Thank you Tony Abbott! Meanwhile, a new report by Barclays estimates that US$5.8tn will be wiped off the global coal trade by 2040 as the world addresses climate change. Australia’s Whitehaven Coal recently reported losses of A$343m and the company’s shares are down more than 80% in five years. If that doesn’t supercharge Malcolm Turnbull’s party to heed his call for innovation including renewable energy, nothing will. Australia needs to plan for the transition away from fossil fuels, especially coal and coal exports. The move toward clean energy is now our most critical environmental and economic issue. Our failure to do so is already impacting workers, communities and our economic opportunities in this rapidly emerging new global market. It’s time to turn that around. John Thwaites, chairman of Monash Sustainability Institute and ClimateWorks Australia Despite the significant global success in reducing poverty and improving health in the past 20 years, we can’t go on as we are. Global growth has come at the expense of unsustainable environmental degradation and potentially catastrophic climate change. The challenge for those leading sustainable development is to find ways to achieve economic prosperity and social opportunity for the world’s growing population, while protecting the environment from degradation that threatens human livelihood. This will require good planning, the right incentives, new technologies and behaviour change. Decoupling growth from resource use, pollution and climate change is possible. In Australia we have shown we can use water much more efficiently in irrigation and industry, boosting output while reducing water consumption. Our cities are now much more water–sensitive, and we are using far less water than we were. We can do even better with more recycling, stormwater harvesting and integrated water cycle management. However as one of the world’s worst per capita carbon polluters, we need to urgently decarbonise our economy. If global warming is to be kept below 2 degrees, Australia will need to be near net zero carbon pollution by the middle of the century. This will only be possible if we start now to implement the four steps to decarbonisation: energy efficiency, 100% renewable electricity, shifting fuels in transport and industry to low carbon electricity and planting forests to sequester carbon. Lisa Annese, CEO, Diversity Council Australia Sustainability is usually related to natural resources, food supplies and energy. However, humans are a vital resource to the future of our planet, and like any other resource, it is important that we consider the workforce and the ways in which businesses manage people in a sustainable way. Having a sustainable business requires us not only to think about the way our companies impact on our environment, but also our impact on temployees, people working in our supply chains and the communities in which we operate. It also means thinking about our longer term human impact and whether we are contributing to a sustainable and, inclusive global economy. To ensure companies deliver the greatest social impact benefit, it is critical that organisations examine their workforce, and whether they attract and retain a diversity of people who can contribute fully. Happily for employers, there is also a strong business case to support diverse and inclusive workplaces, with well documented bottom line benefits. Research shows that diverse and inclusive workplaces are associated with improved job and team performance, greater innovation, productivity, profit and employee wellbeing and engagement. Too many organisations across the globe have yet to properly understand these benefits to their own business, in addition to the greater social good. Many still churn through their people, treating human resources as dispensable tools, and failing to recognise the consequences for broader society in unemployment, mental health impacts, substance abuse and poverty. Many groups in our society currently remain underrepresented and undervalued in the workplace including people with disability, Indigenous Australians, older workers, and those from culturally diverse backgrounds. Barriers to equal participation and more inclusive workplaces are still substantial for women and LGBTI Australians. And while we know that flexibility is a key enabler for a healthy and productive workforce, it is still out of reach for many employees. There is a lot to gain if we can change this picture. Better harnessing the full potential of the workforce can have significant economic benefits. For instance, it has been estimated that removing barriers to women’s workforce participation has the potential to increase the size of the Australian economy by about $25bn a year. And closing the gap in labour market participation and unemployment rates between people with and without disability by one-third would provide a $43bn increase to Australia’s GDP over a decade. It’s time for more businesses to step up to the plate. Overcoming the barriers to long-term workforce sustainability will require commitment, innovation, creativity and ingenuity. We need to get serious about diversity and inclusion by implementing robust strategies with measurable goals, and holding people accountable for achieving them. Until we do, we will continue to waste our greatest resource – people – to the detriment of individual businesses, our communities and our economy. Michael Traill, founding chief executive of Social Ventures Australia and chair of Goodstart Early Learning. We have a pool of close to $2tn in superannuation funding in this country. How liberating would it be if we could think a little differently about how even small chunks of it could be allocated in ways that do not compromise the financial returns reasonably expected to sustain retirement incomes of fund members and contribute a sustainable social, environmental and productivity dividend to the nation? This is a real possibility, as a transaction like Goodstart Early Learning is demonstrating. In the case of Goodstart, $165m in capital was raised to acquire the bankrupted assets of the nation’s largest childcare chain, ABC Childcare centres. In the five years since the deal was closed, the initial investors received a 12% annual interest coupon and the debt provider, National Australia Bank, has had virtually all its debt repaid. This $850m revenue social enterprise is being run effectively with business disciplines for social purpose. The surpluses being generated in Goodstart are directly funding improved quality early learning across the network of 643 centres and targeting improved outcomes in postcodes of need. The model, thinking and capital structure behind Goodstart is entirely repeatable. If we think about the many sectors of the economy across spheres of education, aged care and health where there is a combination of revenue generation and a public policy imperative for high quality social purpose outcomes, Goodstart provides a precedent in demonstrating that both reasonable financial returns and high quality social purpose outcomes are possible. The Goodstart capital structure was predicated on contributions from private investors, the government and a traditional debt provider. If we can bring the most significant capital provider in the country – the masters of our $2tn in superannuation to allocate even 2% of the funding pool to such large scale opportunities - we would create a sustainable $40bn pool of impact investment.And we could help to change the country in the process. Dr Stephen Bygrave, CEO, Beyond Zero Emissions Climate change is pervasive, cuts across all sectors, does not discriminate, affects rich and poor, all races of the world, both men and women and young and old, as well as all living species on Earth. It is the most urgent issue facing humanity. We are all deeply connected to this issue, but most importantly we are all part of the solution.  With technical disruption and innovation occurring in almost every sector, individuals, households and communities are increasingly empowered to take climate action in the absence of any real commitment by national governments. Renewable energy is now cheaper than new coal and new gas, and with the price of solar power dropping a third over the past few years, Australian households continue to have one of the highest penetration rates of rooftop solar in the world. Battery storage is here, making the prospect of households generating their own energy and storing it 24/seven a reality. Autonomous and electric vehicles, as well as companies providing innovative car sharing arrangements, are shaking up the way we move ourselves around the landscape. With LED lighting, induction cookstoves, highly efficient electrical, heating and cooling appliances, as well as smart home energy management systems, our houses can be net generators of energy, not net consumers of energy. Energy retailers are becoming as much our customer as we are theirs.  Every home can achieve energy freedom, empowered to be renewable energy powerhouses. Communities are embracing micro–grid technology, renewable energy community projects, electric bicycle networksand virtual net metering. Additionally farmers are revegetating, using zero or minimum tillage approaches, recycling nutrients and minimising the need for costly inputs such as fertilisers.  This is the present and, increasingly, the future of climate action. Serious action on climate change will make for a more prosperous, more equal , cleaner and fairer world. Action on climate change is not a threat but a huge opportunity. Alicia Darvall, executive director, B Lab Australia & New Zealand One of the greatest sustainability issues Australia faces is the drive for business to deliver return to its shareholders at any cost. The impact that rapid growth and profit focushas had on society, community and especially the environment in the last 50 years is detrimental.  This drive for short-term gain at the cost of both our stewardship of the environment and social equality has lead to a loss of trust in our most powerful institutions. While business has all too often been a bad influence on our world, that is not always the case, nor does it have to be. We are beginning to see an evolution in business from a 20th century view that the purpose of business is to maximize value for shareholders to a shared view that the purpose of business is to maximize value for society. I believe our challenge is to create a generation of conscious consumers, employees and investors who make decisions based on the impact of a business on society and the environment not just price, salary and financial return. This in turn will create a cultural shift so that one day all companies compete to be Best for the World and society will enjoy a shared and durable prosperity."
"Secret trade talks in Geneva could outlaw subsidies for renewable energy, undermining climate discussions in Paris that aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions, anti-poverty campaigners have warned. The Geneva summit involving 22 countries including the US, Mexico, Australia and the 28 EU member states, aim to create a “level playing field”, with the possible consequence that fracking companies could dispute subsidies for solar or wind power.  Unions and anti-poverty campaigners said the implications for developing world economies that want to promote investment in renewable energy would prove disastrous. According to leaked documents, a draft chapter of the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA) would, if adopted, force governments to accept “technological neutrality”. Disputes over subsidies to renewables would be resolved in a tribunal system outside national government control. “This chapter shall apply measures affecting trade in energy related services, irrespective of the energy source dealt with, technology used, whether the energy source is renewable or non-renewable, and whether the service is supplied onshore or offshore,” says the draft obtained by WikiLeaks. EU officials have consistently argued that achieving climate targets will not be undermined by trade talks. The EU has set targets that include a cut of at least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 1990. Brussels must also reach a target of 27% energy consumption from renewables within the same timescale. A European commission said: “The EU is absolutely committed to increasing the renewables share and has demonstrated so over many years, by adopting policy measures to achieve that, complemented by many national policies authorised by or exempted from EU state aid rules. It is inconceivable that the EU would sign up to a trade agreement undermining that.” However, critics of the talks said the proposals as drafted would leave “elected policymakers unable to encourage renewable energy over non-renewable, clean over dirty, or local over imported”. Rosa Pavanelli, general secretary of the PSI international trade union, said: “This is the great climate change swindle. As ambitious targets are being discussed in Paris, in Geneva the means to achieve them are being negotiated away in the interests of the largest corporations. It is becoming clear why our governments try to hide these negotiations by conducting them in secret.” The TiSa discussions are one of several attempts to break the deadlock in global trade deals since the World Trade Organisation’s Doha round of talks became mired in disputes more than 10 years ago. Countries involved in TiSa also include Turkey, Austria, Canada, South Korea and Pakistan. Together they account for about 70% of global trade.  The EU said: “TiSa aims at opening up markets and improving rules in areas such as licensing, financial services, telecoms, e-commerce, maritime transport, and professionals moving abroad temporarily to provide services.” Countries can submit proposals to the talks with the aim of finding a consensus among the states involved.  This year Turkey tabled proposals that aimed to promote health tourism by forcing countries such as Britain, Germany and France to pay for health procedures in countries with cheaper services.  The negotiations are being conducted in tandem with trade talks between major economic blocs covering goods and various regulations. The US recently signed the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement with Japan and 10 other countries, and is in the closing stages of talks with the EU under the umbrella of the Transtlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). While the EU has released some documents related to the TTIP discussions, the TiSa talks have been conducted behind closed doors. The trade page on the European commission’s website says it is seeking a level playing field for domestic and foreign firms and between various energy types. “The EU will seek to end discrimination against foreign suppliers of environmental services. This means removing the existing barriers – not just abstaining from introducing new restrictions,” it reads. The leaked text of the Annex on Environmental Services for the Trade in Services Agreement confirms many of these fears about the agreement’s potential use to reverse regulatory safeguards related to the environment and to inhibit the promulgation of new environmental measures to protect people and the planet. A European commission spokesman said: “Just as with TTIP, nothing in TiSA inhibits a continuation and reinforcement of efforts to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix. The draft TiSA text contains a clear provision applicable to the entire agreement and to all services that clearly recognises the right of TiSA Parties to regulate services within their territories to meet policy objectives.”"

"Where you would expect to see caution and circumspection, instead there is a rush to action. Where you would expect to see determination and resolve, there is only vacillation and delay. The contrast between the government’s handling of the Syrian crisis and its handling of the climate change crisis could not be greater. It responds to these issues with an equal and opposite recklessness.  “We have to hit these terrorists in their heartlands right now,” David Cameron told parliament last week. While it is hard to contest the principle of fighting Islamic State, to do so without a clear strategic purpose and intelligible objectives is lunacy. The 70,000 fighters Cameron believes he can call upon may exist, but most of them are fighting President Bashar al-Assad in other parts of the country. Does he really intend to draw them away from that fight, even if – and this seems unlikely – they are willing to be drawn? After all, he insists (correctly, I believe): “We will not beat Isis if we waver in our view that ultimately Assad must go.” Redeploy Assad’s opponents against a different enemy, and he will consolidate his hold on Syria. This flaw in the plan is so obvious that it should scarcely need stating. Where are the targets, and how will our bombers hit them? Isis is buried among the remaining residents of the city of Raqqa. What ratio of dead civilians to dead fighters does Cameron consider acceptable? For there will be a ratio, and it is likely to be a large one: the terrorists will make sure of that. On what grounds does he believe that a military campaign in one part of the world will discourage terrorism in others? One of the astonishing features of counterterrorism is the dearth of empirical assessment. A paper in the journal Psicothema found “an almost complete absence of evaluation research on counterterrorism strategies … [We] conclude that counter-terrorism policy is not evidence-based.” Of the 11 military adventures the researchers analysed, they found that five had had no discernible impacts on subsequent terrorism; six were followed by more terrorism than there had been before. By contrast, we need no further research to tell us that climate change requires a fast and decisive response. Yet, on every front, Cameron’s government dithers – or worse. The UK is now the only G7 nation substantially to increase its subsidies for fossil fuels: this year, George Osborne granted a further £1.7bn of tax breaks for extracting oil and gas from the North Sea. Cameron has imposed, through the Infrastructure Act 2015, a legal obligation on the government to “maximise economic recovery” of the UK’s oil and gas. As it also has a legal obligation (through the Climate Change Act 2008) to minimise the burning of oil and gas, this creates something of a quandary. But no one in the government appears to care. Cameron has, in effect, shut down the development of onshore windfarms and large-scale solar power, and now wants businesses to invest in gas instead. The only way in which more gas burning could be reconciled with our climate change commitments is to capture and bury the carbon dioxide it produces. But seven days after the government announced its dash for gas, it dumped its carbon capture and storage competition, ensuring that its contradictions are now impossible to resolve. It has cut the funding for energy efficiency in homes by 80%. It is selling its Green Investment Bank. It has cut the incentives to buy less polluting cars. It wants to build new roads and runways. Only with a reversal of these policies, and the vastly expensive closure of the plants Cameron now seeks to commission, could Britain meet its climate targets. So while one Cameron claims to protect us from global threats, another Cameron contributes to a catastrophe likely to dwarf anything Isis could unleash. Even if they are honoured, the pledges that nations have brought to the climate change conference in Paris commit the world to dangerous global warming. But bad faith is contagious, and if governments undermine their own commitments, as Cameron is doing, the outcome will be even worse. A study published in Nature Climate Change last month found that if climate breakdown is not curtailed by the end of this century, temperatures in parts of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Kuwait, Iraq and Iran “are likely to approach and exceed” the levels that human beings can survive in. That doesn’t sound to me like a formula for peace on Earth. During his statement on Syria, Cameron told the House of Commons: “My first responsibility as prime minister … is to keep the British people safe.” So why does he expose us to such threats? Why, when the outcomes are so unlikely and uncertain, does he pursue his bombing campaign with such passionate intensity, while his statements on climate change – where the need for action is so clear – lack all conviction? No politician does anything with enthusiasm unless they wanted to do it all along: look at the glee with which George Osborne pursues austerity, even as its initial justifications are forgotten. Cameron, like other prime ministers, appears to suffer from Churchill syndrome: the belief that, to be a great leader, you need a great conflict. Unlike Tony Blair, he has not invented the war he wishes to join, though his involvement risks its escalation. There is nothing thrilling, nothing that conjures a mental image of sitting codpieced and cockaded on a rearing steed, gazing into the middle distance, about decarbonising the economy. The measures required are mundane and unglamorous. To make your mark, to take your place on the political panelling, you need a few explosions. If the political effort and expense devoted to the bombing of foreigners over the past 25 years had instead been addressed to the world’s environmental issues, we might not now be facing a multitude of crises. But the threshold for bombing has always been low, and the threshold for protecting the living world has always been high. It’s as if governments were indifferent to life and in love with death. • A fully linked version of this article can be found at Monbiot.com"
