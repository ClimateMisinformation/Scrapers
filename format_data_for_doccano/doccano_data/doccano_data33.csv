Suppose a commenter posts a libelous comment here at NorCalBlogs. It’s been known to happen. Can the blogger, Enterprise Record, and its corporate owners be sued for defamation? A federal appeals court just held that no, they cannot. The court noted that a federal law was designed to ensure that ‘within broad limits’, message board operators would not be held responsible for the postings made by others on that board,’ adding that, were the law otherwise, it would have an ‘obvious chilling effect’ on blogger free speech.

Anybody who wonders what we are fighting for in the middle east should read the article below in today’s Boston Globe. In case you didn’t know, there are places where you could go to jail for just reading this.

Iran bloggers test regime’s tolerance
Push boundaries of political dissent
By James F. Smith and Anne Barnard, Globe Staff  |  December 18, 2006
TEHRAN — By day, Alireza Samiei covers banking and insurance for an industry newspaper. By night, he writes a daring online blog about Iran’s social and political ills.
In a recent blog entry, he described a scene he saw while talking to a greengrocer about soaring prices: A young child was pleading, ” ‘Mommy, I want watermelon.’ The woman, shy and sorrowful, singled out one broken, small watermelon from the spoiled fruit bin and told the grocer, ‘Just this one, please.’ She put 20 cents on the counter and hurried away.”
Samiei, 27, is among the growing ranks of Iranian bloggers who are relentlessly pushing the boundaries of free expression, making Farsi one of the 10 most popular languages for blogs. The bloggers are testing just how much political and social dissent the nation’s rulers will tolerate on the Internet.
The authorities are pushing back. They have blocked access to thousands of websites in recent years that are deemed to threaten Iran’s Islamic revolution, including the BBC’s Farsi-language site. A trial began this month against four bloggers on charges including propaganda against the state. And in October, the government barred high-speed Internet service in private homes.
Especially threatening, it appears, are sites that create online communities that might allow Iranians to assemble virtually. The government banned the hugely popular Orkut site, an online Iranian social club. The latest casualty this month: YouTube.com, the American site for sharing videos online. Click on it in Iran and the screen reports, “Access denied.”
The Paris-based rights group Reporters Without Borders includes Iran on its list of 13 countries designated “enemies of the Internet.” That organization’s website is also blocked in Iran.
The organization said repression of bloggers has eased somewhat in 2006. But in a report in November, the group said Internet filtering has accelerated, with two political sites, tik.ir and meydaan.com, closed down in recent weeks. Both had criticized the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Bloggers agree that they have found some latitude in recent months. Many have developed a feel for the boundaries, and some are trying to stretch them rather than break them.
Farzana Sayid Saidi, a 29-year-old reporter and colleague of Samiei, has two blogs, one political and the other showcasing her poetry. She has been blogging in her spare time for two years. Her first blog was shut down within three days, she said, after she wrote that school officials were providing access to abortions in clinics for young students.
Now she’s back at it. She blogged a few days ago that while Ahmadinejad wants people to have more children, his economic policies make it difficult for many families to do so. She said she received some obscene and abusive replies. In a poem on her other blog, she compared Iran’s leaders to the pharaohs of Egypt.
She estimates her readers at only in the hundreds, but adds: “We just want to express ourselves. We don’t know how many people are reading.”
Farzana’s colleague Samiei admires her courage.
“Of the things she writes in her blog, only 1 percent would be acceptable in print,” Samiei said.
She and hordes of other Iranian bloggers are pushing the envelope of the permissible. Technorati, a Silicon Valley search engine for blogs, said in October that Farsi has moved into the top 10 languages worldwide for bloggers. Most estimates put the number of active blogs in Iran at 70,000 to 100,000, and growing fast.
Iran has a long tradition of controlling the airwaves and the print media, banning papers and jailing journalists who criticize official policies.
But Iran’s online activists have proved harder to quash. They have used fast-changing Web addresses, proxy sites, and other technological tricks to get around the restrictions.
“They block us and we evade the blocks,” Samiei said. “It goes on every day. They code, we decode.”
The Ministry of Information periodically sends lists to Internet service providers saying which keywords to filter out so that users can’t get access to websites or blogs that contain them. The government contends that the principal target is pornography and other morally offensive material. The word “sex” is among those blocked.
That has some odd consequences. At one point, an Internet café owner said, the word “hot” was blocked. And that briefly prevented access to Hotmail, the popular e-mail program.
Amirhussein Jaharuti, the manager of a major Internet service provider in Tehran, said the government’s restrictions focus on pornography, and he feels that filtering is appropriate.
“This is the demand of Iranian families, that they don’t want their children to use these kinds of sites,” he said. Asked about the political restrictions, he said: “All governments have ways to control their societies. . . . It’s natural that when we see that someone wants to destroy us, we limit them.”
Jaharuti said his client base has doubled in the past two years, to nearly 70,000. He provides dial-up and digital-subscriber line service to home and business customers at a cost of 20 to 40 cents an hour, or about $20 per month.
Internet use in Iran has exploded in recent years, with about 7.5 million users in 2005 in a country of nearly 70 million people.
Some journalists say the Internet has become even more vital in Iran as the government has suppressed other, more easily controllable forms of expression. Several opposition newspapers have been shut down since September, including the prominent paper Shargh.
The editor, Mohamed Atrianfar, said in an interview that the closure of Shargh and other publications and renewed pressure on critical websites reflects the government’s concern that “the more challenges we have, the more agile and fresh the society becomes.”
“All the hard-liners have mustered all their strength to fight this war. I am proud that we have invoked this reaction in them,” he added.
Despite its closure, Shargh has maintained a website to continue coverage of elections last week.
Atrianfar estimated that about 70 to 80 Iranian journalists have their own blogs.
“Websites and blogs have real impact,” he said. “They have been very powerful in forming a word-of-mouth culture, especially for those between 17 and 35.”
An Internet café owner in central Tehran who gave only his first name, Shariar, said the filtering of keywords rather than individual sites often blocks legitimate websites that people need for academic research. He also said limits on credit cards resulting from US financial sanctions against Iran have all but eliminated e-commerce on Iran’s Internet, a major obstacle to economic growth.
Shariar said that while the government contends it is aiming its restrictions at pornography, “I think they are worried about politics. . . . I think they fear everything. They don’t want people to make connections overseas. They are worried about information.”
The authorities also close Western media sites temporarily. Both The New York Times and Los Angeles Times sites were blocked briefly this month.
A 22-year-old university student, Morteza Yeganeh, said the state-owned broadcasters and newspapers “brainwash people, so we need to find ways to educate ourselves.”
But he said the filtering of sites is effective because “even though people can get around the filters, it is difficult and time-consuming and people give up.”
Most Iranian blogs are apolitical, and government members — including Ahmadinejad himself — have their own blogs to convey their views. But those with blogs that challenge the government know they are taking a risk.
Niloufar Taslim, 24, said that three years ago, she was one of Iran’s first bloggers, writing about social and political problems. But she started receiving e-mails signed by a group calling itself the Army of God, listing her name, telephone number, and address and threatening to kill her.
She shut down that site, but now has two new blogs. One talks about social problems without crossing what she also considers political red lines: transportation and environmental problems.
Another blog features her poems. One laments that she has lost her voice, that in “a situation without possibilities” her hands are “in pain because they cannot write.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Berlin today, some 200 scientists shivered at a scientists4future demonstration in front of the Chancellor’s office in order to protest government inaction on combatting global warming.
German activist scientists silently demonstrated before the Chancellor Merkel’s office to protest inaction over warming. Cropped image: ScientistsForFuture.
One prominent attendee was FridaysForFuture activist Prof. Volker Quaschning, who proudly took the day off from lecturing on taxpayer expense. Here’s what he tweeted just before attending the modest demonstration:

Auf dem Weg zur #scientists4future  Schweigedemonstration heute 12:30 vorm Kanzlerinnenamt. Zur #Klimakrise ist alles gesagt. Handel, liebe Regierung!#FridaysForFuture pic.twitter.com/LNycIksdXa
— Volker Quaschning (@VQuaschning) November 15, 2019

Quaschning, a HTW Berlin professor, is seen above at a bus stop on his way to the demonstration, holding the propaganda temperature stripe chart to protest the German government’s inaction on fighting global warming. Unfortunately the professor looks rather silly all dressed up for winter cold in gloves, knit hat, scarf and coat – to protest warming!
200 scientists shiver to protest warming
The activist Berlin professor wasn’t the only scientist trying to stay warm today while protesting climate warming. Two hundred other scientists also showed up in front of Chancellor Merkel’s office, all bundled up in winter clothes, demanding a stop to the warming and that they be listened to – instead of the working class taxpayers.

Low IQ scientists in Berlin outside freezing, dressed in winter clothing, protesting warming! https://t.co/dOwWfFHoEy
— Pierre L. Gosselin (@NoTricksZone) November 15, 2019

The science-is-settled scientists held up signs declaring, “Everything has been said! Act now!” or: “Decades of climate research: Ignored!”
The question is whether they will be taken seriously by the hundreds of millions of Northern Hemisphere inhabitants who are getting socked by a premature frigid winter this year.
Silent protest
The scientists4future all appeared with their mouths taped shut in order to symbolize a “silent protest”. Or perhaps the tape was to keep their teeth from chattering as they shivered in the bitter November cold.
Of course, the scientists didn’t stick around too long. Reportedly they left for an early start to the weekend – in the warm comfort of their homes.
Today the German government voted to pass measures that among other things will make heating and fuel more expensive for ordinary citizens starting next year.

"The US Federal Trade Commission issued a report on the “internet of things” this week. It announced: Six years ago, for the first time, the number of “things” connected to the internet surpassed the number of people … Experts estimate that, as of this year, there will be 25 billion connected devices, and by 2020, 50 billion. Moments later, UK telecoms regulator Ofcom proclaimed a major initiative to ensure the nation “plays a leading role in developing the internet of things”. So the internet is more than just a topic of work, fun, friends, and family that we routinely mention around the kitchen table; it actually happens there, thanks to such canny innovations as “smart chopsticks”. These new wonders can detect rancid food and hence protect animal-eating diners from fish-oil infections. The technocentric promise of this golden age is that electrical appliances will connect to the internet via subscriber identification modules (SIMs) and radio-frequency identification devices (RFIDs). Technology boosters promise a world where digital wallets will replace cheques and credit cards; personalised electronic adverts will compete with static hoardings; and transport, electricity, power and water systems will provide a continuous real time update of their performance and user status. Firms will offer us advice and services built on analysis of such data. The internet of things is described as a marvel – the moment when wireless becomes limitless. Building sensors save energy; homes are automated beyond even the vision of post-war suburban idylls; transportation is effortlessly streamlined; smartphone applications direct daily life; manufacturing is tied to merchandising which is tied to consumption; and healthcare occurs at a distance from the bodies being cared for. The very idea is proclaimed as an expansion of knowledge, convenience, and hence wellbeing. Cybertarians hail a new age of ethical consumption in which customers know the environmental and labour history and future of the devices and services they purchase and have greater control over their own lives than ever before. We are at the peak of what the Gartner research firm calls a “hype cycle”, when expectations of new technologies rise giddily. This is followed by sober realism and everyday use. The Design Museum has rapturously announced that we are entering “A New Industrial Revolution”. Given the costs as well as the benefits connected to the first one – illness, death, pollution, slavery, and war are all there on the downside – one might think the advent of this miraculous new age would provide opportunities to rethink the absurd lightness of being routinely attributed to the internet. For the past two decades of cybertarianism have been an era of ignorance. We have neglected the dirty, material origins and processes that characterise communications technologies like tablets, phones, and laptops. We have forgotten the real story of Cold War militarism, undersea cables, conflict minerals, slave labour, toxic exposure, and illegal recycling. We got such things (the environment, workers, and legality) badly wrong the first time, and risk repeating the mistake due to the obfuscatory claims for a post-smokestack internet age. Then there are the problems with architecture, security, robustness, interoperability, regulation, and privacy across the internet of things – and doubt even encircles the holy fetish of modernity: economic growth. In 1987, the year he won the pseudo-Nobel prize for economics, Robert Solow identified what has become known as the “Solow Paradox”. He came to this insight while reviewing the tide of futurism that accompanied the Cold War and is now reborn via the internet. Solow doubted the wonders of a service economy, which he thought might produce “a nation of hamburger stands and insurance companies”. The memorable phrase he used was: “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” Last year, the National Bureau of Economic Research published findings that buttress Solow’s Paradox, a decade after it was supposedly dispatched to the dustbin of history courtesy of the internet. This research suggests that unemployment hastens productivity growth, not information technology. And of course, the internet of things will see labour displaced onto customers, who will become increasingly responsible for work previously undertaken by full-service utilities providers, for example, through properly-employed experts. And what about the instant purchase and upgrade fetishes that will add massive over-consumption to mass capitalism’s inexorable crises of overproduction? The internet of things will create a mountain of junk. Its electronic detritus will be untold. Suddenly your light switch, toothbrush, trousers, tights, kettle, bedroom toys – and chopsticks – will be rendered useless thanks to software upgrades, otherwise known as built-in obsolescence. And that fish-oil prophylactic – do you need it? Why not cease industrial fishing?"

Anyone who knows much about me knows that I’ve been a strong advocate for alternate energy, and that I’ve put my money where my mouth is by putting solar power projects on my home as well as at Little Chico Creek School in my former role as CUSD Trustee.
Now I’m going to push an alternate way to do home or business computing.
A couple of months ago I wrote about the upcoming release of Windows Vista, and how I was disappointed that this new release from Microsoft and all of its Digital Rights Management (DRM) nonsense made the operating system turn your PC into a version of George Orwell’s Big Brother.
A friend of mine, school Trustee Rick Anderson recently dumped his PC and bought a Mac Mini because he said he was tired of all the viruses, spyware, upgrades and the like. I pointed out that if all he needed to do was do email, web browsing, word processing, some digital picture work and maybe some video editing, then the Mac Mini would be a good choice since it comes with all those things right out of the box.
It’s an important point, because what I described is what the majority of non technical people need in a personal computer. So why go through the expense and hassle that has become Windows? That got me to looking at an operating system that I once only thought of to be the domain of the uber Geeks – Linux.
For those who don’t know about Linux, or have the view that you have to be one of those people that stares at a computer screen until 3AM and then falls asleep on a stack of empty pizza boxes, that used to be the case. But Linux has grown up. While there are still a few distributions aka distros out there that cater to that some new ones have emerged recently that are as easy to use as Windows. They even come with applications like word processors, spread sheets, etc and the best part is they are free or low priced. Some work right out of the box, requiring only a simple install.

Since Microsoft had me so ticked off because of the expense and corporate control issues in Vista, I recently started experimenting with a Linux distro called Ubuntu. Now don’t let the weird name scare you, this is actually the most amazing thing I’ve seen in awhile. Ubuntu is as African word meaning “humanity to others” and the company that is distributing it bills the software as “Linux for Human Beings”. The company seems to be setup like a philantrophy, they want to bring computers to people whom can’t afford it. With Vista costing upwards to $500 for ll of its features, they are positioned well to do that.
I recently installed it on a blank PC, and was instantly impressed. Best of all it’s free if you know how to download it and burn it to a DVD. If not, they have lost cost media you can buy.
My installation experience was fast and easy. And I had Ubuntu up and running within 30 minutes. It was just as simple as putting in the DVD, answering a few simple questions about configuration, and off it went. It came up, updated itself automatically wiht the web connection and was ready to run.

It comes with everything a home or small office might need. Word processor and Open Office Application Suite, Firefox web browser, Email, and a bunch of other applications including a cool paint program called “gimp” that rivals Adobe PhotoShop. Ubuntu comes installed with a project management application called Planner. The tool allows users to create simple Gannt charts, tasks, and allocate resources. There’s even a Microsoft PowerPoint clone. And you can read or save Microsoft document formats for all their office applications.

There are hundreds of other free aplications available for download.
Ubuntu recently announced they are offering a free video/graphics/audio editor to make DVD’s and edit video from camcorders and sound/music tracks. You can see a preview of Ubuntu Studio here
If you can run Windows you can just as easily run Ubuntu Linux. It’s fast, relaible and virus/spyware free.
I gotta say that if you just want a simple and reliable student, home, or office PC at minimal cost, one that will actually run effectively even on older inexpensive hardware, Ubuntu is it.
Microsoft is going to lose some of their edge to unique companies like this.

"The UK’s onshore wind power industry may have been dealt a huge blow by new government policies announced last week, but this apparent setback should instead be seen as an opportunity. Elsewhere in Europe local, cooperative wind power is flourishing – could your town be next? This wind turmoil comes at a point when politicians are widely struggling with the “energy trilemma” of balancing affordability and sustainability while also securing national supplies. The Queen’s Speech on behalf of the new Conservative government explicitly included a new Energy Bill designed to increase energy security – a clear prioritisation of one side of the “energy trilemma” in the next parliamentary period. Changes affecting the UK’s onshore wind power sector include devolving consent powers for any large onshore wind farms away from the secretary of state to local planning authorities. The government also plans to end its commitment for new subsidies for onshore wind farms. Taken together these measures appear to send out a strong signal that government support for onshore wind power in the UK is ending. Unsurprisingly, reactions to the announcements have been largely negative with companies fearing job losses and the terminal decline of this sector. Industry representatives are concerned about the capacity of local authorities to deal with these new powers in a competent and timely manner. Yet at the same time, these proposals may provide the sector with a much-needed incentive and an opportunity to develop new business models that increasingly rely on and reward local ownership and support given that communities are now in charge. The question is whether the onshore wind sector is able to turn this situation to its advantage, perhaps similar to the way the sector has flourished in countries such as Denmark and Germany. There, onshore wind projects are predominantly in the hands of mid-size firms and owned largely by communities and small investors. In Denmark, too, local municipalities determine whether and where wind turbines can be placed. This suggests that empowering local decision makers and drawing on citizen investment schemes can actually have positive effects on the industry. This is a model that could be adopted in the UK but there are caveats. First, the success and growth of small-scale wind in the past has relied on financial support in the form of feed-in tariffs – a scheme that is now under review and likely to be limited. the industry must now demonstrate the ability to stand on its own feet to support itself financially. In fact, onshore wind is already competitive and one of the cheapest forms of energy production. But it still has to compete with solar, offshore wind and other renewables for financial and governmental support, which leads to media complaints about how much these subsidies are adding to consumer energy bills. Much then depends on project size. Typically, big wind farms tend to be developed by large companies backed by institutional investors. A modern 2.5MW (commercial scale) turbine, on a reasonable site, will generate 6.5m units of electricity each year – enough to make 230m cups of tea. So the large wind farms above 50MW affected by the changes would typically consist of more than 25 turbines. For them, the challenge will be to cooperate with and convince local authorities of the wider benefits of these projects in order to gain planning consent. By contrast, many of the smaller projects have an inherent advantage. Increasingly they are crowd-funded such as one proposal by Yorkshire-based Edgehill, which seeks to raise £2.5m from investors chipping in as little as £50 to build ten turbines in ten different rural locations. With their risks and benefits shared between large numbers of individual investors, these projects are used to keeping locals happy, dealing with NIMBYs, and bringing them on as investors.  The question is which of the two project types and business models will become more successful in garnering local support over the coming years. It is possible that developers with closer links to local government authorities and community organisations are likely to emerge stronger from this political shift. In short, we might see more, but smaller wind farm projects. There is also a regional dimension to this, as the proposed Energy Bill will definitely not apply to Scotland, and perhaps also exclude Wales. The UK currently has 538 projects worth 7,240 MW in the pipeline which will be affected differently depending on where they are located. For onshore wind, devolved powers for Scotland are a good thing. For example, 37 out of 45 proposed sites for large-scale projects awaiting planning consent are based in Scotland and so would remain unaffected by the latest proposals. The future viability of the UK’s onshore wind energy sector will be determined by developers’ skills in attracting capital funding, managing local authorities and obtaining a “social licence to practice” from affected communities. Less clear, however, is how the government intends to square its declining support for the cheapest form of renewable energy and increased efforts to shore up the nation’s remaining oil and gas reserves with its other aim of “seeking to address climate change through ambitious action at home”. It seems that despite prioritisation ultimately the government cannot escape the energy trilemma."

Global warming alarmists like claiming that a certain place is seeing more warming and climate change than everywhere else. Remarkably, they say that about almost everywhere, which of course makes no sense.
Today we look at Canadian temperature trends using the data from the Japan Meteorological Institute (JMA) for stations where they have data available going back to at least the mid 1990s.
First we look at December mean temperatures. What follows is a chart depicting the results of 9 stations across Canada:

Of the 9 examined stations, seven show no warming taking place at all in Canada over the past quarter century for the month of December. Data: JMA.

The data hardly show the trends you’d expect from a place that is supposed to be “warming faster than anywhere else”.
Canada mean annual temperatures show no warming 
Okay, those are only data for December. How about the annual mean temperatures?
What follows are plots for the mean annual temperatures for the 9 stations: 
Data source: JMA
The plots speak clearly enough: we have been seeing more cooling than warming.
Though the surface of the globe may be have warmed modestly as a whole, nothing unusual is going on. What we are likely seeing are mainly natural oceanic cycles at work, which we still know very little about.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProbably the most disturbing aspect of wind energy is its destructive impact the green energy source has on the environment, never mind its sporadic supply, adverse health impacts and high costs.
As Germany ignored all warnings about wind energy’s shortcomings and its threats, government officials charged ahead blindly and obstinately, without a plan, into the uncontrolled development of the power source.
Germany wrecks its landscape
What follows is a photo video montage of how a beautiful natural landscape near the (once) scenic central German community of Wartenberg was tragically transformed into an industrial eyesore.

The photos were taken by Herrmann Dirr
The “Vogelsberg” wind project was carried out by a cooperation consisting of utility HessenEnergie, “scrupelous” forest owners and the community of Wartenberg.
The video posted on YouTube starts by showing a once idyllic scenery the area offered before the wind project came along and stamped it out. At about the 1:20 mark we begin to see the destruction inflicted on nature to build the project and then how today it is an almost inhospitable area for much wildlife.
Ruining communities to “save the planet”

It’s a classic example of how people professing to have good intentions, yet lacking in vision and judgement, allow themselves to be hijacked by populist green ideology and end up ruining everything they touch around them. They tell us they will rescue the planet, but only end up ruining their communities. It’s a disgrace.
These “leaders” operate according to true populism. They make promises that sound good to the masses who cannot think one step ahead and see the true consequences.
Vermont’s, Bernie Sanders’s disaster
It all reminds me how a few years back my home state of Vermont (whose source of power was in large part green hydro to begin with) deforested and dynamited its green mountain tops which took nature millions of years to sculpture, and then installed large wind turbines. Also see here and here.

How Vermont protects the environment by installing wind turbines. Photos taken near Lowell. 

Silent spring for Vermont wildlife. Making way for green energies. Stupid as stupid gets.

"Is the Guardian really arguing that leaders who don’t jet into Davos aren’t committed to poverty reduction and climate action (World Bank chief’s Davos snub dashes hopes of climate consensus, 23 January)? The World Bank Group (WBG) is taking concerted action to tackle global poverty and boost shared prosperity by delivering concrete results for the world’s poorest and most marginalised people, including broad-based and sustainable growth, jobs, debt transparency, rule of law, good governance, human capital and green financing.  In his first year, the WBG president, David Malpass, has met more than 100 leaders around the developing world, in countries from Pakistan and Egypt to Ethiopia and Mozambique. Our strong focus on country results is one reason why the World Bank has repeatedly been given the highest rating among international agencies in the UK Department for International Development’s reviews of multilateral development partners. The WBG is committed to climate action and provides by far the most climate-related finance among multilateral development banks and other international organisations, almost half of the total. In the last fiscal year alone, the WBG committed $17.8bn (£13.6bn) to climate-related investments – and we announced $200bn of climate finance over the period 2021-25. The World Bank Group and our leadership remain focused on the urgent and significant challenges facing more than 700 million people living on less than $1.90 a day.Jeremy HillmanDirector, corporate communications, World Bank Group • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

You know the old saying that “no two snowflakes are alike“? Well it may be possible for two snowflakes to be alike after all. There’s a fascinating article in LiveScience that details how this may be possible.
For anyone who studies probability, this seems reasonable, given that the article mentions that 10^24 snowflakes fall in any given year. The article also contains a photo gallery of fascinating snowflake pictures like the one shown above.
From the article: “A typical snow crystal weighs roughly one millionth of a gram. This means a cubic foot of snow can contain roughly one billion crystals … It is probably safe to say that the possible number of snow crystal shapes exceeds the estimated number of atoms in the known universe.”
Kenneth Libbrecht, a professor of physics at California Institute of Technology runs a website devoted entirely to Snow Crystals at www.snowcrystals.com which is also visually impressive.

Here’s an interesting graphic on the formation of Snow Crystals:

"More than 90% of the £2bn in energy deals struck at this week’s UK-Africa investment summit were for fossil fuels, despite a government commitment to “support African countries in their transition to cleaner energy”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opened the summit on Monday, citing the climate emergency: “We all breathe the same air, we live beneath the same sky, and we all suffer when carbon emissions rise and the planet warms.”  But the commercial energy deals revealed later were dominated by oil and gas production. The official UK government statement on the summit and a press release failed to mention these, citing only the far smaller support for clean energy. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the “hypocrisy of the government’s position is breath-taking”. Johnson also announced that UK taxpayers’ money would no longer support overseas coal-fired power plants and coal mining. Yet MPs on the environmental select committee reported in 2019 that “UK Export Finance (UKEF) has not supported a coal project since 2002”.  A report by Greenpeace and Newsnight also found that UKEF spent billions of pounds abroad supporting fossil fuel projects that will emit an estimated 69 million tonnes of carbon a year. The UK will host a critical UN climate summit in Glasgow in November, at which nations must dramatically increase their pledges to cut carbon emissions to avoid a disastrous 3o-4oC rise in global temperatures. The five oil and gas deals announced after the summit are worth £2.1bn, led by oil company Tullow investing £1.2bn in continued oil production in Kenya. The other fossil fuel contracts span the continent from Nigeria to Mozambique and Tunisia to Cote D’Ivoire. In contrast, just £161m in deals – 8% of the total – were related to clean energy, the biggest being for £80m of solar-powered irrigation pumps for Uganda and £50m to help build a solar farm in Kenya. Before the summit, Lucas asked ministers which companies would attend, but the Department of Trade refused to reveal the names, citing “commercial interests”. “Now we know why the government was so secretive,” said Lucas. “The hypocrisy of the government’s position is breathtaking. It boasts of its green credentials one minute, and then hosts an investment summit which sees billions being invested in carbon-intensive industries in Africa. This government’s promises on climate action are completely hollow. “As hosts of this year’s UN climate summit, the UK needs to show international leadership and bring other countries with us. We can’t do that while UK money and business is supporting dirty energy around the world.” A spokesman for the Department for International Trade (DIT) said: “The UK is committed to tackling climate change and supporting African countries in their transition to cleaner energy. Less than one-third [of the total £6.5bn in deals] were in oil and gas.” At the summit, Johnson said the UK would help African nations “extract and use oil and gas in the cleanest, greenest way possible”, while also delivering “an electro-convulsive lightning bolt through our renewables industry”. Other deals struck at the summit included a total of £170m for aircraft and airports and £224m for a new Kenyan gold mine. The biggest deal was £3.2bn for Bombardier to construct and operate two monorail lines in Cairo, Egypt. The UK taxpayer is directly funding £50m of clean energy projects, including energy storage batteries and energy-efficient housing. “The government is stepping up our offer to work with African countries to unlock their massive renewable energy potential,” said the DIT spokesman. Nick Dearden, director of campaign group Global Justice Now, said: “The supposedly transformative £6.5bn UK investment in Africa includes oil, gas, gold mining and airlines. So much for fostering ‘climate-friendly’ development. “In the 19th century, the ‘scramble for Africa’ was carefully disguised as a humanitarian project. Now, 150 years later, what we saw at the UK-Africa summit was a desperate and unseemly grab for markets, dressed up as ‘development’.”"

From the France surrenders just to be safe department :
Some “experts” think we should put the U.N. in charge of our space defense against large meteors or asteroids that could wipe out Earth. Ok, let me ask you a question.
Can you name one thing the U.N. has been able to accomplish with complete success? …..Yeah, I thought so.
If the world needs to deflect an asteroid, or even practice doing it, failure is not an option. So rather than leave the fate of the world in the hands of this, ahem, “capable” diplomatic organization, who you gonna call? (Hint, they have headquarters in Florida and Texas). Please, leave space work to space agencies, and the hand wringing to diplomats.
SAN FRANCISCO (Feb. 18) – An asteroid may come uncomfortably close to Earth in 2036 and the United Nations should assume responsibility for a space mission to deflect it, a group of astronauts, engineers and scientists said on Saturday.
Astronomers are monitoring an asteroid named Apophis, which has a 1 in 45,000 chance of striking Earth on April 13, 2036.

Although the odds of an impact by this particular asteroid are low, a recent congressional mandate for NASA to upgrade its tracking of near-Earth asteroids is expected to uncover hundreds, if not thousands of threatening space rocks in the near future, former astronaut Rusty Schweickart said.
“It’s not just Apophis we’re looking at. Every country is at risk. We need a set of general principles to deal with this issue,” Schweickart, a member of the Apollo 9 crew that orbited the earth in March 1969, told an American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in San Francisco.
Schweickart plans to present an update next week to the U.N. Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on plans to develop a blueprint for a global response to an asteroid threat.
The Association of Space Explorers, a group of former astronauts and cosmonauts, intends to host a series of high-level workshops this year to flesh out the plan and will make a formal proposal to the U.N. in 2009, he said.
Schweickart wants to see the United Nations adopt procedures for assessing asteroid threats and deciding if and when to take action.
The favored approach to dealing with a potentially deadly space rock is to dispatch a spacecraft that would use gravity to alter the asteroid’s course so it no longer threatens Earth, said astronaut Ed Lu, a veteran of the International Space Station.
The so-called Gravity Tractor could maintain a position near the threatening asteroid, exerting a gentle tug that, over time, would deflect the asteroid.
An asteroid the size of Apophis, which is about 460 feet long, would take about 12 days of gravity-tugging, Lu added.
Mission costs are estimated at $300 million.
Launching an asteroid deflection mission early would reduce the amount of energy needed to alter its course and increase the chances of a successful outcome, Schweickart said.
NASA says the precise effect of a 460-foot object hitting the Earth would depend on what the asteroid was made of and the angle of impact.
Paul Slovic, president of Oregon-based Decision Research, which studies judgment, decision-making and risk analysis, said the asteroid could take out an entire city or region.

"Air pollution pumped out by factories and power plants in Europe and North America has led to drier spells in the tropics, thousands of miles to the south. Scientists had long suspected this was the case and even had modelled the change in computer simulations, but now for the first time we have direct evidence – straight from a cave in Belize. Most of us, when asked to think about climate change, think of global warming and the unequivocal rise in greenhouse gases. But greenhouse gases aren’t the only pollutants we produce which have the potential to disrupt the climate. Atmospheric sulfate and nitrate aerosols, produced from burning fossil fuels, alter the climate both directly by reflecting solar radiation and indirectly by altering clouds. The impact of these aerosols is to offset the warming caused by greenhouse gases – where GHGs cause the Earth to retain heat, aerosols keep heat out in the first place.  However, as aerosols don’t stick around in the atmosphere for long, their effects are much stronger close to their source. It’s one reason why we see big regional differences in climate change. Indeed, observational and modelling studies provide considerable evidence that aerosols have lowered surface air temperatures in the northern hemisphere, offsetting greenhouse warming. Characterising our influence on the climate is challenging for many reasons. Climate is a complex web of intricately bound variables, difficult to understand and even more difficult to predict. But there is one issue with climate science that complicates things more than any other: the lack of instrumental data. Beyond the past 130 years, instrumental and observational data is sparse and uneven. It’s not very useful when looking to give context to our current climate debate. The study of climate history therefore relies on proxies to reconstruct the conditions at a given point.  These proxies are natural archives such as sediment cores, ice cores, tree rings and rocks – these record certain aspects of the climate in their physical characteristics. The width of tree rings, for instance, or the amount of carbon found inside air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice for thousands of years. By analysing these archives we can create climate records that extend far beyond the short era of thermometers and rain gauges. In our research, published in Nature Geoscience, we present one such climate reconstruction produced from a stalagmite collected from a cave in Belize in Central America. Stalagmites (the ones that grow upwards from the ground) grow incrementally as saturated water, filtered through the rock above, drips into the cave and leaves behind what becomes new rock.  Every drop of water has a unique chemical signature that is largely controlled by prevailing climate conditions above the cave, meaning that stalagmites record climate changes as they grow. By analysing the geochemistry of these incremental growth layers in a 450 year-old stalagmite, we were able to construct a historical rainfall record for the region. Recently it has become increasingly clear that climate changes in one region can have an impact in a totally different latitude. The IPCC’s 2013 summary for policymakers IPCC 2013 concludes with confidence that man-made changes in the North Atlantic climate are linked to rainfall at lower-latitudes. Precipitation in the tropics, including Belize, is governed by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) – a belt of monsoon rainfall encircling the Earth near the equator that migrates seasonally between the hemispheres. The relative temperature difference between the hemispheres plays a crucial role in controlling the position of the ITCZ and hence, rainfall distribution in the tropics. What we found was a distinct drying trend in Belize since 1850 that coincides with a steady rise in industrial aerosol emissions in North America and Europe. This presents strong evidence that industrial sulfate emissions have shifted the position of the ITCZ through reflecting the Sun’s incoming radiation and therefore moderating warming in the northern hemisphere. In other words, aerosol pollutants have changed the relative thermal contrast between the two hemispheres and subsequently led to the ITCZ moving southward. This means less rainfall for the northern tropics. The role of sulphate aerosols in repositioning the ITCZ was previously identified through computer modelling techniques, but until now no suitable climate record existed to support those ideas. Our claims are backed up by the volcano record. Emissions from volcanoes are similar to those produced by burning fossils fuels – basically lots of sulphur – and we identified short-lived drier spells in the northern tropics following very large volcanic eruptions in the northern hemisphere, such as the Icelandic Laki eruption in 1783.  This provided evidence that any injection of sulphate aerosols into the upper atmosphere, both natural and man-made, can disrupt temperatures and rainfall. These volcanically forced dry periods essentially rule out the possibility that the climate shifts were caused by a previously unknown natural climate cycle or increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.  Although warming due to man-made carbon dioxide emissions has long been at the centre of discussions regarding climate change, the shifting of rain belts has significant regional-scale effects. The tropics are heavily populated and extremely reliant on regular rainfall. Linking human-induced changes and natural changes from the past to understand where the climate currently stands, and where it might go in the future, will be as socially important as it is scientifically challenging."

In a nod to alternate energy, Ford annouced a new sports sedan with roots in the Mustang design that will run on E85 ethanol fuel. It’s called the Ford Interceptor. It is shown above. The fuel it can burn, E85,  is a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.
Ford says: âOur customer target for this powerful masculine sedan was a man with a family,â? Horbury said. âHeâs essentially a good guy, but a bit mischevious. He loves power and performance. But ultimately, heâs responsible. When he has his family on board, he values new safety technology as well as a powerful engine that runs on E-85 ethanol.â?
You may have read in the ER where Rick Keene went to South America to view how ethanol is produced and used as an alternative to gasoline. In Brazil, ethanol is produced from sugar cane and fuels a major portion of their automobiles. It was Brazils response to the Opec induced oil crisis of the 1970’s, and it’s a good idea.
In the USA, ethanol is produced from corn, but its production efficiency is reportedly not as good as with sugar cane. Nonetheless, demand for ethanol continues to grow, with new production facilities coming online each year.

Ford has issued the following press release:
Building on its legacy of bold muscle cars, Ford is introducing a modern, all-American sedan concept that combines âBuilt Ford Toughâ? attitude with the sporty elegance of its iconic 1960s sedans.
The Ford Interceptor concept comes equipped with a manual six-speed gearbox mated to a Ford Racing 5.0-liter V-8 Cammer engine that delivers 400 horsepower and runs on E-85 ethanol.
âThis concept celebrates the best of American muscle, showing customers what âmodern muscleâ is all about,â? said Peter Horbury, executive director â Design, The Americas. âThe Interceptor concept is much like a Marine in dress uniform. He looks smart and elegant but you can see the raw power that lies beneath.â?
Flexing Modern Muscle
The Ford Interceptor conceptâs exterior design features substantial, sometimes brutish, surfaces and sections that give the concept its modern, powerful look.
The Mustang-based concept features a traditional rear-wheel drive proportion that includes a short front overhang, long rear overhang and extended dash-to-axle ratio.
The Ford Interceptor also has a low cabin and higher beltline, adding to the vehicleâs attitude and sense of mystery.
âThe Ford Interceptor concept is a pure sedan that speaks to performance car lovers everywhere,â? said Freeman Thomas, director, North American Strategic Design. âThese people might need more space, but they still appreciate the power and attitude that cars like this represent,â?
Painted a deep blue, the Ford Interceptor conceptâs strength exudes from its strong, high shoulders. And much like on last yearâs Ford F-250 Super Chief pickup concept, a single character line runs the length of the body side, slightly sloping downward as it reaches the back of the sedan.
This adds wedge to the car, making it dynamic, without detracting from its smooth, clean design.
Signature Ford touches include the horizontal three-bar grille, which has been structurally integrated into the bumper beam, as well as âsquirclesâ? â or professionally square circle-shaped graphics â inside and out.
As a nod to performance purists, the ultimate muscle lies under the powered clamshell âshakerâ? hood, which caps a thoroughly detailed engine compartment that houses a 5.0-liter V-8 Cammer engine.
This is an upgraded variant of the 4.6-liter engine under the hood of the current production Mustang GT. The Cammer modular engine powered Ford Racingâs FR500C race car to the top of the Grand Am Cupâs GS class, achieving five victories on its way to the Drivers, Manufacturers and Team Championships in its first season of competition.
The Interceptor conceptâs Cammer engine is mated to a manual six-speed transmission. The car, equipped with 22-inch wheels, also features a solid rear axle for more hard-core performance feel.
Attitude Within
Inside, the Ford Interceptor concept is sleek and thoroughly modern, completed in contrasting black leather and metal finishes.
The dash, headliner and thick steering wheel are leather-wrapped. Plus, the Interceptor conceptâs four low-back bucket seats are wrapped in thick black belt leather with exposed-edge seams and contrasting caramel stitching. The seats are accented with Ford GT-inspired squircle grommets finished with Titan Metal painted inserts.
Squircle accents are repeated in the conceptâs door trims, floor, console and instrument panel.
Designed within a pair of squircles, the speedometer and tachometer are eye-catching. The needles for both start at center and move opposite each other as the speed and RPM climb.
Other clever touches include retractable headrests that deploy from the roof when the car is parked. They adjust fore and aft, as well as up and down for each occupant. Audio control panel and climate controls also are stowable.
On the other hand, the gated six-speed shifter is exposed, just waiting to be thrown into gear.
âThe Interceptor concept is a sedan â but with the heart and soul of a performance car,â Thomas said. âThis car is about restraint â and not clouding the driving experience with too much technology. There arenât a lot of layers between the driver and the road with this car.â?
Safer travels
For safety, the Interceptor concept incorporates Fordâs patented four-point âbelt and suspendersâ? safety belt design in all four seats and inflatable seat belts in the rear.
While current three-point safety belts are extremely effective in reducing the risk of injury in a crash, Ford Motor Company is researching these two potential safety belt technologies as possible ways to further reduce injury risk in vehicle crashes.
A number of technical challenges still need to be overcome before such restraint systems could ever be used, but these technologies might one day further enhance safety belt effectiveness.
The four-point belt showcases a possible next-generation safety belt that is more comfortable and easier to use than traditional three-point belts, according to consumer research. Additionally, inflatable belts have been included in the rear seat of the concept to help better protect occupants in a variety of crashes.

I’ve been saying this all along…the sun is the Big Kahuna of climate change on earth. CO2 effects pale in comparison to the effects of the sun. I’ll have more on this in part 3 of my series on 2006’s Record setting temperature year.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The brightening and dimming of the sun may account for a 1,500-year cycle of cooling and warming on parts of the Earth, a study of ice in the North Atlantic suggests.
Researchers found that a very slight difference in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth can have a powerful chilling effect on the climate: ice builds up in lands bordering the North Atlantic, the average temperature drops in Europe and North America.
see the full story here from USATODAY
This goes hand in hand with another study by the University of Main Climate Change Center as reported by SPACEREF
And just in case that’s not enough light reading for you, here is a study from Harvard that talks about “Chaos” and the sunspot cycle.
Part of the abstract is quite telling: “…by examining 1500 years of sunspot, geomagnetic, and auroral activity cycles. Sub-harmonics were found of the fundamental solar cycle period during the years preceding the Maunder minimum and loss of phase of the subharmonic on emergence from it. These phenomena are indicative of chaos. They indicate that the solar dynamo is chaotic and is operating in a region close to the transition between period doubling and chaos.”
Translation: The sun can easily tip from one state to another, with resultant changes in solar output.

It’s not often that I get to have a glass of wine at a restaurant in Chico and have WiFi Connectivity at the same time. Having both of these at the newly opened Market Cafe where Highway 32 meets 99 I decided I’d do my first “Live” blog entry.
Restaurants come and go in Chico, some don’t ever rise above the level of having an “open” sign. Finding new ones with ambiance and class is a treat. Finding one that gives every customer a free appetizing plate after 5 is even better.
This restaurant used to be “The Bean Scene” which was started by a couple of people I used to call “The Evil Blonde Ladies” because they’d come into Bidwell Perk and take notes on that business just before opening up their own gig. They didn’t make it, partly because it took them 20 minutes to toast a bagel.
So seeing a new restaurant in Chico is always a good thing, as on Friday and Saturday nights it’s often impossible to find a classy place to eat that isn’t fully booked. So while I’m never mentioned any Chico business before, I thought this one was worth a mention not only because they are new, but because its run by locals, Bob and Patricia Johansen.
I’m partial to wine blends, as they tend to take the edge off of the aftertaste. Tonight I sampled one of the best blends I’ve had in a very very long time. Its called Falling Star Merlot-Malbec (shown above), and I gotta tell you it beats my former favorite “Clous du Bois Marlstone” by a long shot, and costs about 66% less. ($19/bottle -vs- $60)
It’s worth checking out, if nothing else for the free appetizer and WiFi.

Years ago in the 50’s, nuclear energy was the big idea of the time. Clean and nearly limitless energy for everybody was the promise, and ideas such as having a home nuclear power station were even floated to provide independence from the power grid.. I was so impressed with this idea that I did lots of work in nuclear physics even at my own high school, building a 1 MEV cyclotron (a form of atom smasher) which I powered with my dad’s arc welder.
After winning my state science fair, I went to the national science fair with it, but didn’t win there, partly because I think I terrified some of the judges when I fired it up. Getting it there was quite a job, lugging a 1200 pound steel electromagnet cross country and setting it up again was a good lesson in logistics.
I even started out in college in nuclear engineering, then 3 Mile Island happened and I saw the handwriting on the wall. Nuclear fission, which is what we use now, creates all sorts of radioactive isotopes as byproducts of the fission, and they remain radioactive for thousands of years, making disposal/storage a problem.
Nuclear FUSION on the other hand, doesn’t have such byproduct problems, and its been the holy grail of clean nuclear power for 50+ years, but it’s been elusive because its so difficult to do and still produce a net power gain.
That’s why I found this story from the Detroit Free Press interesting, it hit close to home, building a nuclear fusion reactor in your basement brings back memories of my own tinkering. Maybe someday, we’ll see a safe and clean fusion reactor in your home. If I’m still of this earth, I’ll be the first to buy one.
The work this young man did in his basement was a continuance of work done by eccentric inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, who is credited with inventing television, though RCA clearly stole the idea from him and commercialized it.
Farnsworth’s approach to fusion has been dubbed “Inertial Electrostatic Confinement” or “IEC” for short. (VERY) simply put, the process uses forces within the atomic particles themselves to bring them close enough to fuse. The more common approach uses tremendous external forces to achieve the same effect. These enormous machines employ powerful magnetic fields and the method is called “magnetic confinement” Literally billions of dollars have been spent in the last thirty years with little to show in the way of meaningful results. After thirty years, the “experts” still say that a practical fusion power plant is still – would you believe? – at least another thirty years away.
This article underscores why we need to encourage more science and technology
for our youth. The US keeps slipping behind.


TEEN GOES NUCLEAR: He creates fusion in his Oakland Township home
November 19, 2006
BY GINA DAMRON
On the surface, Thiago Olson is like any typical teenager.
But to his friends, Thiago is known as ""the mad scientist.""

Thiago Olson, 17,
stands near his nuclear fusion reactor, which he calls ""the Fusor,"" at
home in Oakland Township on Friday. After more than two years and 1,000 hours of
research, the Stoney Creek High School senior, with a little help from his dad,
built the machine. (PATRICIA BECK/Detroit Free Press)
In the basement of his parents’ Oakland Township home, tucked away in an area
most aren’t privy to see, Thiago is exhausting his love of physics on a project
that has taken him more than two years and 1,000 hours to research and build —
a large, intricate machine that , on a small scale, creates nuclear fusion.
Nuclear fusion — when atoms are combined to create energy — is ""kind
of like the holy grail of physics,"" he said.
In fact, on www.fusor.net,
the Stoney Creek senior is ranked as the 18th amateur in the world to create
nuclear fusion. So, how does he do it?
Pointing to the steel chamber where all the magic happens, Thiago said on
Friday that this piece of the puzzle serves as a vacuum. The air is sucked out
and into a filter.
Then, deuterium gas — a form of hydrogen — is injected into the vacuum.
About 40,000 volts of electricity are charged into the chamber from a piece of
equipment taken from an old mammogram machine. As the machine runs, the atoms in
the chamber are attracted to the center and soon — ta da — nuclear fusion.
Thiago said when that happens, a small intense ball of energy forms.
He first achieved fusion in September and has been perfecting the machine he
built in his parents’ garage ever since.
This year, Thiago was a semifinalist for the Siemens Foundation’s National
Research Competition. He plans to enter the Science and Engineering Fair of
Metropolitan Detroit, which is in March, in hopes of qualifying to be in the
Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in New Mexico in May.
To his mom and dad, he’s still reminiscent of the 5-year-old who toiled over
a kid-friendly chemistry set and, then at age 9, was able to change the battery
in his older brother’s car.
Now, in a small room in the basement, Thiago has set up a science lab —
where bottles marked ""potassium hydroxide"" and ""methanol""
sit on shelves and a worn, old book, titled ""The Atomic Fingerprint:
Neutron Activation Analysis"" piled among others in the empty sink.
Thiago’s mom, Natalice Olson, initially was leery of the project, even though
the only real danger from the fusion machine is the high voltage and small
amount of X-rays emitted through a glass window in the vacuum chamber — through
which Olson videotapes the fusion in action..
But, she wasn’t really surprised, since he was always coming up with lofty
ideas.
""Originally, he wanted to build a hyperbaric chamber,"" she said,
adding that she promptly said no. But, when he came asking about the nuclear
fusion machine, she relented.
""I think it was pretty brave that he could think that he was capable to
do something so amazing,"" she said.
Thiago’s dad, Mark Olson, helped with some of the construction and electrical
work. To get all of the necessary parts, Thiago scoured the Internet, buying
items on eBay and using his age to persuade manufacturers to give him discounts.
The design of the model came from his own ideas and some suggestions from other
science-lovers he met online.
Someday, he hopes to work for the federal government — just like his
grandfather, Clarence Olson, who designed tanks for the Department of Defense
after World War II. Thiago, who is modest and humble about his accomplishment,
said he knew from an early age what he would do for a living.
""I was always interested in science,"" he said. ""It’s always
been my best subject in school.""
But, his mom had other ideas.
""I thought he was going to be a cook,"" Natalice Olson said,
""because he liked to mix things.""

Image: Average temperatures warmed in nearly all parts of California between 1950 to 2000. Image credit: NASA/JPL/Cal State L.A Click for Larger Image
Average temperatures in California rose almost one degree Celsius (nearly two degrees Fahrenheit) during the second half of the 20th century, with urban areas leading the trend to warmer conditions, according to a new study by scientists at NASA and California State University, Los Angeles. Results of the study appeared in the journal Climate Research.
But 50 years of temperature trends hardly proves anything relevant about climate change, other than its gotten warmer in the past fifty years. 50 years in terms of our planet and the suns processes is a blink. I have to think that because NASA chose to co-author this paper with researchers at California State University, that some of the statewide “global warming as man-made problem bias” crept into the thinking for the purpose of this paper, i.e. “we need another study to show that its getting hotter so action is justified”.
What is troubling about this study is that many of California’s historical climatological stations, when done on a 100 year trend, rather than a 50 year trend, show a net cooling over the period, or a reversal of trend. The northern Sacramento Valley has very few reporting stations that go back 100 years, so I only have 4 data points, but it makes me wonder just what data the NASA/CSU study used to come to the conclusion that our area has warmed 1.1 degrees F over the last 50 years.
I’ve prepared some side-by-side graphs below of Sacramento Valley stations to illustrate that point:

My data source: U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) Data Set
Yet the NASA/CSU paper claims “The only area to cool was a narrow band of the state’s mainly rural northeast interior“. None of the stations above are in that area, but are in the North Sacramento Valley.
Even odder than that, cold and snowy Mt. Shasta, where you’d expect to hear about depleted snowpack, it’s melting glacier on the side of the mountain, and other “signatures” of “global warming” shows a significant drop in temperatures over the last 50 years. yet the NASA/CSU study for that area concludes that a 2.1 degree F rise in temperature occurred.

Granted a few data points don’t equal a complete study, but the fact that I’ve been able to find and plot in a couple of hours, several places that don’t match the trends in the NASA/CSU study calls their methodology into question. Note the cities I used are all small rural cities, but the NASA/CSU study plotted major, medium, and minor cities in California to draw their conclusions. From their own paper they admit that the areas that have grown the most have shown the greatest temperature increases:
Southern California had the highest rates of warming, while the NE Interior Basins division experienced cooling. Large urban sites showed rates over twice those for the state, for the mean maximum temperatures, and over 5 times the state’s mean rate for the minimum temperatures. Average temperatures increased significantly in nearly 54 percent of the stations studied, with human-produced changes in land use seen as the most likely cause. The largest temperature increases were seen in the state’s urban areas, led by Southern California and the San Francisco Bay area, particularly for minimum temperatures.
For example, look at Pasadena, CA once a small city itself,  but in the last 100 years it became a dot in the sea of the second largest American City, Los Angeles. It’s temperature trend, unsurprisingly, is sharply upward, for both the 50 and 100 year trends. Its drowning in a sea of asphalt and concrete, is it any wonder it shows a temperature increase?

The inescapable conclusion is that the NASA/CSU study is plotting the effects of urban heat islands, and applying that trend to the entire landmass of California to reach the conclusions they have mapped onto the state map of temperature trend they present.
A simple filtering based on urban growth factors would yield a temperature map with a far different result.
To their credit though, they recognize this fact:  “If we assume global warming affects all regions of the state, then the small increases our study found in rural stations can be an estimate of this general warming over land. Larger increases would therefore be due to local or regional changes in land surface use due to human activities.” 
For the most part, “urban warming” has dwarfed “global warming” in its magnitude, a fact that is lost on some who look at temperature data from weather stations worldwide and treat them all equally in the quest to prove a theory.

"Greta Thunberg has criticised world and business leaders for ignoring calls to break away from fossil fuels, as young people protested in Davos over the climate emergency. Speaking on the final day of the World Economic Forum, the 17-year old climate campaigner said leaders were not reacting to the crisis, and were not being held accountable for their inaction. “Before we came here we had a few demands for this WEF and of course those demands have been completely ignored, but we expected nothing less,” said Thunberg, speaking before marching through Davos with fellow climate activists. “As long as the science is ignored, and the facts aren’t taken into account, and the situation is not treated as a crisis, then world and business leaders can of course continue to ignore the situation,” she said. Thunberg, who appeared on two panels at the forum, has called for an immediate end to investments in fossil fuel exploration, fossil fuel subsidies and for investors to ditch fossil fuel assets. But while many delegates spoke about the importance of climate issues, actual action was harder to find. Luisa Neubauer, a 23-year-old German climate activist, said she had met the chief executive of Siemens, Joe Kaeser, at Davos this week to press him to abandon a contract to supply rail signalling to a mine in Australia. The Adani project would be one of the world’s largest coalmines, and Neubauer said such fossil fuel activity needed to be curbed by companies and investors. Otherwise the Paris agreement’s goal of keeping global heating to 2C this year could not be met, she said. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  “If you add up all the contracts that have been signed by today on fossil fuel projects, we will be far beyond 2C,” said Neubauer. “Some of those contracts, if not all of them, will have to be cancelled if we want to actually do something about Paris. “This is not a radical demand, this is a rational demand,” she added. On Thursday, the US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said climate activists should recognise the impact of fossil fuel divestment on jobs, and said Thunberg should go study economics before offering advice. Thunberg said such barbs, like Donald Trump’s criticism, had no effect on her. “We are being criticised like that all the time. If we cared about that, we wouldn’t be able to do what we do,” she said, before leading a Fridays for Future protest in the ski resort. Some climate actions were announced at Davos, including a push to plant 1tn trees, which Donald Trump backed. Thunberg warned earlier this week that planting trees was not enough to tackle the climate crisis. But Micah White, the co-founder of the Occupy Wall Street movement, said the trillion tree campaign would work as a Trojan horse to help mobilise people to fight the climate emergency. “I love the trillion tree campaign, because hundreds of millions of people will need to be mobilised at the grass roots,” he said on the sidelines of WEF. “To actually mobilise that number of people, and plant that number of trees, will be such a systemic disruption of our day-to-day lives that it will be revolutionary.” White said corporations would have to tell staff, “You don’t have to come into work this week, we’re all planting trees”, and governments will have to deposit trees in all the schools, to actually carry out the plan. White attended Davos with a manifesto titled “An Alliance Of Opposites”. It proposed that protest movements, governments, activists, industry, and civil society could work together on the climate emergency. THIS IS WHAT I SAID TO ELITES AT DAVOSIt was a surreal experience to hand this candidly written activist manifesto to a few of the world’s most powerful people at the World Economic Forum in @Davos. https://t.co/dmuwyU0NJP#WEF2020"
"Sun-kissed walkways in the sky, platefuls of seafood ceviche, a private helicopter pickup from the beach – the Instagram account of Danish architect Bjarke Ingels has unfolded like an escapist travelogue epic in recent weeks, as his adventures in Latin America have taken their place in his dizzying globetrotting itinerary. But there is one photograph he hasn’t been so keen to share with his 730,000 followers: of him standing next to Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s far-right president, with the uneasy smile of a man who’s just secured his latest big commission from another unsavoury despot, in this case one who has boasted of being “proudly” homophobic. According to a statement from Brazil’s ministry of tourism, Ingels visited Brazil to tour several states and discuss strategies for developing sustainable tourism on its north-east coast, in partnership with the Nômade Group, which recently built an eco-conscious luxury resort in Tulum, the ruins of a Mayan walled city in Mexico.  “They’ve pioneered this incredible barefoot light-impact environment,” says Ingels, speaking by phone from Santiago in Chile. “It’s a model of tourism development that doesn’t replace the forest or the sand, but strengthens and preserves it. It’s a very welcome alternative to the kind of high-rise hotels that spring up on the beach in many places.” Such an eco-conscious approach doesn’t seem to chime with Bolsonaro’s reactionary regime. Since he came to power last January, Brazil’s president has confirmed every fear that he would be a “Trump of the tropics”. He has appointed climate-change deniers to prominent roles, dismissed deforestation statistics as fake news, and sacked the head of the institute that undertook the research. Last year, he played down the worst fires for a decade in the Amazon, calling the global outcry the result of “deceitful” media hype. He once said he would prefer a dead son to a gay one, rails against Brazil becoming a “gay tourism paradise”, and his recent introduction of abstinence-based sex education has been likened to “going back 40 years”. So what is Ingels, self-styled seer of a progressive liberal world, doing with such a figure? “I’m happy to share the ideas and ideals that I hold with any government willing to listen,” he says, “especially if they hold different beliefs. If there’s a responsibility that comes from the creative platform we’ve created, it is to use that platform to change the world for the better.” He says that the political leaders of the north-eastern Brazilian states they visited are “from the opposite end of the political spectrum” to Bolsonaro, adding that ultimately “great ideas transcend political parties”. Over the last few years, Ingels has gone from being the mischievous young designer of mountain-shaped apartment blocks on the outskirts of Copenhagen, to becoming the go-to celebrity architect for some of the world’s biggest corporations. Now 45, he has recently popped up as the face of everything from Hyperloop to WeWork, and is currently designing a city-sized HQ for Google in California. Then there’s his actual city for Toyota in Japan, right under Mount Fuji.But most audacious of all, he tells me, is the masterplan he is now working on for the whole of Earth – provisionally titled The Masterplanet. His status as big tech’s cheeky go-to boy is perhaps what also makes him so attractive to a growing client base of autocrats. Both kinds of patron share an insatiable desire to shape every aspect of the world to their exacting vision, be it a future of autonomous vehicles, or a world where the Amazon rainforest is seen as a “virgin” that should be “exploited”, as the climate-crisis-denying Bolsonaro has put it. BIG, which stand for Bjarke Ingels Group, is also engaged in several major projects in Saudi Arabia, including a new leisure resort city called Qiddiya, 45km from Riyadh, billed as a new “capital of entertainment”; there’s also a confidential project that Ingels describes as “a human-made ecosystem that is as close to a utopia as you dare imagine”. Would this be a utopia that had – in accordance with Saudi law – flogging for drunkenness, amputation for robbery and extrajudicial killing for anyone criticising the regime? “I do sincerely believe that the urban transformation of Saudi Arabia that we’re taking part in is part of paving a path to a clearly needed social and cultural reform of the country,” says Ingels. Following the state-sanctioned murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, he says his office debated whether to pull out of the projects (as Norman Foster did), but decided they could do more good by continuing to engage. “The road to ethical impact as an architect is to [propose] the future we want to companies and governments,” he says, “even if they have different views. We have to embrace our differences if we want to create a future that is different.” It’s easy to dismiss his words as naively optimistic, like a TED Talk for dictators, but he has a point – architecture and cities long outlast the ideologies that created them. But they do also reinforce the politics of their sponsors. Ingels is by no means alone. French architect Jean Nouvel has become the darling of the autocratic Gulf monarchs, designing the Louvre Abu Dhabi, the National Museum of Qatar and now a luxury resort in Saudi Arabia. He has in the past dismissed the issue of human rights as “an old question”, echoing the response of the late Zaha Hadid, architect of the vulva-shaped stadium in Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. “I have nothing to do with the workers,” Hadid said when challenged about the fact that hundreds of migrant workers had died on construction projects in Qatar. “I think that’s an issue the government – if there’s a problem – should pick up. It’s not my duty as an architect to look at it.” Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas was equally frank about his work in China, when asked about designing the enormous HQ of China Central Television, the chief organ of state propaganda. “A position of resistance seems somehow ornamental,” he said. “On our own, we can at most have good intentions. But we cannot represent the public good without the larger entity, such as the state.” Revealing the allure of totalitarian regimes, he added: “To make matters worse, the more radical, innovative and brotherly our sentiments, the more we architects need a strong sponsor.” Sharing Ingels’ belief that architects can effect change from within, Jacques Herzog compared his work on the Birds Nest – the 2008 Beijing Olympic stadium – to designing a “Trojan horse”. He told German newspaper Der Spiegel that “only an idiot” would have turned down the project on moral grounds, adding that his firm’s design creates “all kinds of niches” and “meeting places” around the edge of its latticework structure, hidden away from government surveillance. This is a recurring theme. Whenever the topic of ethics comes up, most architects who work in repressive climates believe their projects can transcend the abuses of the host regimes and make everyday life a bit better for the people who live there. The dilemma is whether to boycott or engage. Should a well-intentioned architect avoid working with any system they disagree with – or hope that the conditions of workers, or freedom of speech, might be improved by using their platform to raise these issues? “It’s just surface rhetoric,” says Jeremy Till, dean of Central Saint Martins art school in London and author of Architecture Depends, which examined the discipline’s relationship with money and power. “The idea that a single building is going to be emancipatory for a whole totalitarian state is ridiculous.” Till was involved in the RIBA’s recent ethics report, which asserted an “unequivocal commitment” to placing public interest, social purpose and sustainable development at the heart of RIBA activities. He is particularly critical of some of the practices that have signed the recent Architects Declare manifesto, pledging to advocate for low-carbon, eco-friendly development – while also designing airports. “There are some architects who abdicate their responsibility,” he says. “I do understand that – but then they shouldn’t virtue-signal by signing up to these agreements.” As for Ingels’ latest foray into the tropics, Till doesn’t hold out much hope. “It’s a fantasy that by doing a nice greenwash project in the north-east of Brazil, you are going to save the nation from fascism.” Ingels differs. “The proof will be in the pudding,” he says. “I don’t know if we’re going to succeed in bringing positive change, or come up with a great alternative to the traditional developments that destroy the landscape and debase the local community. But we will definitely not succeed if we don’t even try.”"

PlayStation3 is out. I’m under-whelmed. The most odd part of this is
that people are actually leaving their jobs, schools, and family to camp out in
front of stores to be first to get a GAME. Go figure. Are they so lacking for
meaningful things in their life that this becomes the most important thing?

For those who wonder why there’s a bunch of hoopla surrounding this game,
part of the reason that it is so anticipated is that this game box has a very
powerful CPU and GPU (graphics processing unit) combo that gives tremendous
real-time 3D rendering capability for unsurpassed realism. Reportedly up to 2 Teraflops per second (2 trillion floating point operations per second) which is the kind of performance a supercomputer like a Cray used to boast ten years ago. While the PS3 isn’t quite there yet for 100% photorealism in real-time, I anticipate PS4 or PS5 to render things so realistically you won’t be able to discern it from photographic or film imagery. Here is an image
from the PS3 game ""Gran Turismo"". Is it real or rendered?



Another feature of the PS3 is the built in Blue-Ray DVD
player, which plays HDTV DVD’s now starting to be available. Hi-Definition TV is
catching on and for gaming with a big 52"" flat panel it can be an immersion
experience. I’ve seen demos at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Vegas. Its
really getting hard to tell what is real anymore.
Living in alternate reality is OK for some people…its
a diversion. But I worry about the kind of folks whom get so addicted to this
that they have to camp out to get the next game. What sort of future do they
have? Gaming doesn’t put food on the table, nor help our economy, or foster good
citizenship.
My son will be asking for these games someday. When that
day comes I plan to call up Michael Jones and ask him to help me give my son a
crash course in hiking the natural world.
In the meantime, I may just buy one of these:

An erupting solar prominence photographed by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). [More]
In a post a few days ago I mentioned scientists discovering that global warming appears to be happening on Mars in its polar ice caps and that this was likely evidence of a solar linkage that also affects Earth’s climate. Today NASA announced in an article shown below that the next solar sunspot cycle due in 2010 is likely to be one of the historically largest in 400 years of sunspot records.

What does this mean? Well if you follow sunspots and temperature trends on earth you’ll be able to see clear correlations between the ebb and flow of sunspots and Earthly temperature. While global warming proponents brush this off as inconsequential, the fact is that when sunspots happen in larger numbers, Earth warms up, when they disappear, the earth cools, as evidenced by a 50 year cold period in Medieval history with virtually no sunspots known as the Maunder Minimum. Its also called The Little Ice Age.
So, with a big sunspot cycle in the next few years, we can expect many record high summer temperatures and warmer than normal winters. We’ll see melting sea ice, retreating glaciers, and wailing of those saying “We told you so, CO2 is killing the planet!”. Al Gore will probably get elected President by a panicked nation, and general worry and angst will reign supreme. Emergency CO2 emissions measures may be enacted. Perhaps a rationing on driving our cars?
And then, when solar cycle 25 hits ten years later, which will likely be much smaller, the “crisis” will subside and those whom enacted those emergency measures will pat themselves on the back and bask in their “heroism”. Except, it won’t have anything to do at all with changes in emissions. It’s all about the sun. Just take a look at the picture above and notice just how small earth is compared to the sun, or even a large solar flare. Anybody whom thinks the human race has more effect on our global energy balance than an active sun does is just deluding themselves.
There’s a monetary bet out there: two Russian solar scientists are so certain that its the sun driving climate change and nothing else, they have put down a $10,000 bet with a prominent climate change scientist saying we’ll see a cooler of the earth by about 2015.
I want some of that action. Bets anyone?

From NASA, Dec. 21, 2006: Evidence is mounting: the next solar cycle is going to be a big
one.
Solar cycle 24, due to peak in 2010 or 2011 ""looks like its going to be one of the most intense cycles since record-keeping began almost 400 years ago,"" says solar physicist David Hathaway of the Marshall Space Flight Center. He and colleague Robert Wilson presented this conclusion last week at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.
Their forecast is based on historical records of geomagnetic storms. Hathaway explains: ""When a gust of solar wind hits Earth’s magnetic field, the impact causes the magnetic field to shake. If it shakes hard enough, we call it a geomagnetic storm."" In the extreme, these storms cause power outages and make compass needles swing in the wrong direction. Auroras are a beautiful side-effect.
Hathaway and Wilson looked at records of geomagnetic activity stretching back almost 150 years and noticed something useful:. ""The amount of geomagnetic activity now tells us what the solar cycle is going to be like 6 to 8 years in the future,"" says Hathaway. A picture is worth a thousand words

Above: Peaks in geomagnetic activity (red) foretell solar maxima (black) more than six years in advance. [More
In the plot, above, black curves are solar cycles; the amplitude is the sunspot number. Red curves are geomagnetic indices, specifically the Inter-hour Variability Index or IHV. ""These indices are derived from magnetometer data recorded at two points on opposite sides of Earth: one in England and another in Australia. IHV data have been taken every day since 1868,"" says Hathaway.
Cross correlating sunspot number vs. IHV, they found that the IHV predicts the amplitude of the solar cycle 6-plus years in advance with a 94% correlation coefficient.
“We don’t know why this works” says Hathaway. “The underlying physics is a mystery. But it does work.”

According to their analysis, the next Solar Maximum should peak around 2010 with a sunspot number of 160 plus or minus 25. This would make it one of the strongest solar cycles of the past fifty years—which is to say, one of the strongest in recorded history
Left: Hathaway and Wilson’s prediction for the amplitude of Solar Cycle 24. [More]
Astronomers have been counting sunspots since the days of Galileo, watching solar activity rise
and fall every 11 years. Curiously, four of the five biggest cycles on record have come in the past 50 years. “Cycle 24 should fit right into that pattern,”says Hathaway.
These results are just the latest signs pointing to a big Cycle 24. Most compelling of all, believes Hathaway, is the work of Mausumi Dikpati and colleagues at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. “They have combined observations of the sun’s ‘Great Conveyor Belt’ with a sophisticated computer
model of the sun’s inner dynamo to produce a physics-based prediction of the next solar cycle.” In short, it’s going to be intense.
Details may be found in the Science@NASA story Solar Storm Warning
“It all hangs together,” says Hathaway.

Picture above – Sunpot numbers have been increasing for the last 150 years and have been at their highest average levels during the last 20 years, which could explain much of the global warming conditions observed on earth.
Note that during the 1970s, sunspot numbers decreased, we had some severe winters, and many scientists and popular press at that time talked of a coming ice age.  You can read a June 24th, 1974 article about a coming ice age in the TIME Magazine archive here:
http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944914-1,00.html
Even as recently as 1994, TIME was concerned about a possible ice age coming as we see in this article:
http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980050,00.html
Chances are, we’ll see another dramatic dip in sunspots by 2015 through 2022 and global cooling will set in again as it did in the 1970’s.

Share this...FacebookTwitter[Correction: James Taylor is Director of Heartland’s Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy, and not the President of The Heartland Institute]
Today I’m writing about a public relations disaster here in Germany by the Heartland Institute where its president, James Taylor, allowed himself to be fully duped by leftist journalists posing as industry lobbyists offering half a million dollars to his Chicago-based think tank.

Image: Correctiv
Just days ago, flagship ZDF German public television broadcast a segment here — created by “investigative” site Correctiv here — at its popular weekly Frontal 21 magazine. Frontal 21 describes how the two “investigative” journalists from the leftist Correctiv infiltrated Heartland Institute and exposed its “lobbying and climate disinformation campaign”.
The ZDF’s Frontal 21 magazine shows how Correctiv set up a phony PR agency, fake website and printed phony business cards so that two of its reporters could pose as lobbyists representing the German automotive and coal industry. Their Project Veritas-like mission: to infiltrate Heartland and uncover “what goes on in the climate denier scene, how it works, which strategies it’s pursuing in Europe and how influential it is.”
“That’s how we want to find out whether and how to question climate change in exchange for money and to buy influence,” reported Frontal 21.
Unfortunately, James Taylor fell for the entire ploy. The ZDF’s Frontal 21 (and Corectiv) took the material and later pieced together a major hit piece seen nationally on February 4th. A blow to the skeptic scene in Germany.
First meeting in Munich
The two undercover German journalists started by making their way from their base in Berlin to the Munich Climate Conference last November, where they had an easy time fooling James Taylor.
Equipped with hidden cameras, they sat down with Taylor for dinner and asked how he went about convincing people of his mission. ZDF’s Frontal 21 quotes Taylor: “The people cannot be motivated by logical things; you have to argue emotionally.”
$500,000 offer in Madrid

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




According to Frontal 21, after dinner Taylor then personally invited the two “German lobbyists” to Madrid for a later conference, where they met again with Taylor in the Marriott Hotel lobby.
ZDF Frontal 21 reported: “Taylor boasted about his good contacts to the Trump administration. ‘The Trump administration often asked for advice and about what we could do. We worked closely together.'” Taylor even told the undercover journalists that Heartland’s budget was $6 million.”
When asked how a $500,000 donation could be made, Frontal 21 says Taylor told them to donate it directly to Heartland. “And if you want to remain anonymous, then give it to an organization. One of them is Donors Trust.”
“To keep it hidden?” one undercover Correctiv journalist asked.”
“Yeah right, exactly,” replied Taylor, alleges Frontal 21.
Untypical for interviews, Taylor’s voice is completely filtered out by Correctiv editors, so it’s impossible to ascertain whether Frontal 21 translated Taylor’s words accurately.
In the Marriott lobby meeting, Taylor discloses Heartland’s future plans for Germany, where he also brings up young German influencer Naomi Seibt – the “anti-Greta”.
Duped by the mean and nasty media
Weeks later, Taylor sends the two undercover journalists his proposal dubbed “Funding Proposal: Germany Environmental Issues”, outlining Heartland’s strategy for Germany and that Heartland was interested in the funding in order to inform the public about the minimal effects of diesel exhaust and to produce videos on the negative impacts of excessive environmental regulation.
The set-up succeeded, and Correctiv got all the footage they needed, and much more, to allow German ZDF public television to weave a highly distorted, one-sided, yet believable hit piece. All in all, a major PR blow for climate skeptics in Germany.
A little research and precaution on Heartland’s part could have avoided being duped to the extent they were. They were sloppy. And we also have to feel bad that a young, promising German influencer got caught up in it and was so inaccurately portrayed on national television.
In her latest video, a visibly distraught Naomi tells of her experience of being observed by impostors under the table by hidden cameras, yet bravely pledges to keep up the fight for what she believes to be the truth. Now she understands just how mean and nasty the German media really are.

And yet the rate at which a CO2 molecule retains or slows down heat loss is, at most, a negligible 0.0001 of a second. A CO2 concentration of 300 ppm versus 400 ppm will therefore have no detectable impact.
SkepticalScience, a blog spearheaded by climate science “consensus” advocate John Cook, is widely considered the explanatory guidebook for the anthropogenic global warming movement.
The blog claims CO2 molecules, with a representation of 4 parts in 10,000 in the atmosphere (400 parts per million, or ppm), collectively function like a blanket does in slowing down the rate at which the human body cools.

Image Source: SkepticalScience
The rate or time lapse involved in this “slowing” of heat loss is problematic to the paradigm that says CO2 drives global warming, however.
Professor Nasif Nahle has mathematically assessed the rate at which heat is retained by CO2 molecules; his work was endorsed by the Faculty of Physics of the University of Nuevo Leon (Mexico).

Nahle found the “mean free path” for a quantum wave to pass through the atmosphere before colliding with a CO2 molecule is about 33 meters (Nahle, 2011a). Such a wide chasm between molecular collisions would appear to undermine a visualization of CO2 functioning like a blanket does.
Even more saliently, Nahle determined that the rate at which CO2 molecules can retain heat at the surface may only last about 0.0001 of a second (Nahle, 2011b).
If heat-loss is slowed down at a rate of 0.0001 of a second by CO2 molecules, the atmospheric CO2 concentration – whether it’s 300 ppm or 400 ppm – effectively doesn’t matter. The time lapse differential would be immaterial for either concentration.
Consequently, Nahle concludes “carbon dioxide has not an effect on climate changes or warming periods on the Earth”.

Cities are usually hotter than rural areas, and get referred to in the jargon as “urban heat islands.”  Cities are hotter for a number of reasons. Traffic pollution creates a greenhouse effect that keeps heat in at night. Cutting down trees means you lose their ability to absorb heat and convert it into nutrients. Paving and tarmac quickly release the heat they retain back into the air, and rainwater has to be drained away in sewer systems, which deprives the area of the cooling effect of rain-soaked soil. Then there are people. They both generate body heat and heat buildings to keep themselves warm – or use air-conditioning to cool them down. Aircon means they are transferring warmer air into the streets outside, so it adds to the city’s warmth just as much as heating systems.  As cities expand in size and more people live in them, these warming factors have gradually been exacerbated. In the south of England, the difference between rural areas and London is as much as 6°C. In Glasgow, even though the population has subsided until recently, the difference can still be as much as 8°C.  In hotter parts of the world, this is reaching breaking point in some cases. Colombo in Sri Lanka has seen people migrating away in substantial numbers to live in cooler areas, for example. The searing heat in Phoenix, Arizona, may prevent the city from continued expansion. Even in more temperate cities like London or Paris, unexpected heatwaves can kill hundreds and even thousands of people.  Discussions about global warming tend to overlook the contribution of urban growth to the problem, and instead concentrate on what is happening to the temperature across the world.  And policy developers aiming to fight global warming overlook the fact that by focusing on ways to make cities cooler, they might contribute in a big way to the solution – perhaps much more than focusing on global carbon-reduction agreements that either fail or end up badly watered down. Given the forecasts for climate change out to 2050, this looks like a vital trick that is being missed.  The good news is that cities have been living with the effects of local warming for decades. By observing different cities around the world, we can see what needs to happen – the problem is getting those cities that do less to focus on doing more.  The solutions in hotter and cooler climates are different. [Research](http://researchonline.gcu.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/rohinton-emmanuel(c687e6ca-47ef-47f5-810c-b662ff2eda72/publications.html) in warm, humid Colombo shows excessive amounts of solar radiation. But because of the availability of abundant water from year-round rainfall and a large amount of urban vegetation, there is much less temperature difference between the city centre and rural surroundings. This suggests that were this not in place, the migration problem could be even worse.  The research found that you a big difference can be made to the climate in tropical cities, whether humid or arid, through shade. This requires an ethos of urban design that turns on its head the old idea of “thou shall not cast shadow on thy neighbour’s property” and instead says, “thou shall cast shadow on public spaces.” This is not about shading buildings per se (nor is this desirable) but to encourage an urban geometry that makes the spaces between buildings naturally shaded without compromising buildings’ ability to draw in the sunlight as and when required.  Achieving this when the tropical sun is so high in the sky means that you have to use an intelligent combination of building heights and geometry together with elements such as canopies, awnings and urban vegetation.  With care and attention to detail, built-up areas can combine good shading with generous urban vegetation to cool neighbourhoods to temperatures that are even below those of rural areas. This is good news given the continued acceleration of urban growth in many tropical cities and rising concentrations of people. And even a couple of degrees’ difference can make a city unbearable in an area that is already hot.  London and New York are a good examples of what cities in cooler areas can do to make a difference. Their heat island policies include things like planning requirements to plant trees, reduce paved areas in parking lots and reduce traffic. But these sorts of policies are still quite rare across the board, and neither do you see much similar action in hotter climes. Singapore is one of very few tropical cities that prioritise traffic control for example.   Finally a word on colder cities such as Glasgow, where I am based and have been involved [in work](http://researchonline.gcu.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/rohinton-emmanuel(c687e6ca-47ef-47f5-810c-b662ff2eda72/publications.html) to look at ways to make it cooler. This may not seem very necessary when the temperature is not particularly high but we need to bear in mind that it is likely to get hotter in the coming decades, so it will still contribute to global warming. For example our simulations suggest that if you increase tree cover by 20%, you could eliminate a third to half of the expected urban heat increase by 2050. This sort of intervention looks well worth considering. "

What do the numbers 923, 930, 935, 941 and 944 have in common? Answer: They’re different names for the same sunspot, this one shown above.
Greg Piepol of Rockville, Maryland, took the picture yesterday using a Solar Max Solar telescope/camera. It shows sunspot 944 coming around the sun’s eastern limb–for the fifth time! Usually sunspots form and dissolve in a matter of weeks, but this spot has endured for more than five 27-day solar rotations. By long and idiosyncratic tradition, a sunspot receives a new number each time it reappears and is visible to earth.
Sunspot 944 may not seem impressive now, but one month ago as “941” it was a lovely spiral. Three months ago as “930” it produced one of the strongest solar flares of the past 25 years and Northern Lights as far south as Arizona. What will it do this time?
Even though we are in between peaks in our 11 year sunspot cycle, we still seem to have quite an active sun. The trend over the last century has been that our solar cycle has had more activity than centuries before.

Of course, that couldn’t possibly have anything to do with global warming.

Whew! It has been a busy week, with lots of things to report. So rather than
making a blog entry for each one I thought I’d condense them all into one entry
with links.
The emphasis this week seems to be on the sun, and the fact that maybe its
really the sun which has been driving climate change after all. That’s what I’ve
been saying for years, because its just unrealistic to ignore the largest and
single most important contributor to our planets energy balance and to only
focus on made-made CO2 and nothing else.
Here are some headlines and links to the reports:

Share this...FacebookTwitterI feel obligated to upgrade a reader comment by Jim Lakely, Communications Director, The Heartland Institute, to a post. He says I was “being very unfair” yesterday.
My main gripe is that these two very dishonest Correctiv “journalists” should have never been allowed to get as far as they did. Now we independent skeptics here in Germany have to deal with being smeared nationally again.
In Germany, the skeptics are outnumbered by like 20 to 1; it’s not a 50-50 deal like in USA. German MSM journalists like those at ZDF are very nasty, unfair and dishonest to legitimate climate science critics.

Jim Lakely, Director of Communications, The Heartland Institute
I have other comments, but will hold them for another time.
I’d love to see a point-by-point rebuttal from Heartland to the nonsense made by ZDF Frontal 21 and Correctiv so that we can defend ourselves here.

Pierre,
You are being VERY unfair to James Taylor and Heartland, and Naomi Seibt — who is not “distraught,” but angry (as is Heartland) at how this has been able “to weave a highly distorted, one-sided, yet believable hit piece.” You had it right on “distorted,” and not so right with the rest.
First: James is surely flattered by your battlefield promotion, but he is not the president of The Heartland Institute. He is the Director of Heartland’s Arthur B. Robinson Center on Climate and Environmental Policy.
Second: They “worked” James spottily over several days in two cities over two weeks before he sat down for a brief talk. That’s a lot of squeeze for no juice. Their big “get” was a big nothing. They tried to bait James into agreeing for a “pay to play” arrangement, and the reporters say … “he didn’t say no.” Really? After two weeks of work, they finally get around to asking their “money question” and that’s it?
There’s a reason James didn’t say “yes”: Because “pay to play” is not what Heartland does, unlike many think tanks on the left. You’re seriously faulting James for steering a (fake) potential donor away from that “gotcha” dishonorable idea into discussing honorable like-minded work with a donor? By that standard, no one in the climate realist movement would ever be able to raise any funds to support our work.
Ask yourself: If these “journalists” had a genuine “smoking gun,” wouldn’t they have presented that instead of that lame “gotcha”?
Third: To compare this lame, days-long caper to the work of Project Veritas is a massive insult to the latter’s fantastic work.
I hope, Pierre, that you will consider giving Heartland some space on your site to more fully rebut for your readers your unfair and uncharitable take on this. Considering all Heartland has done to promote climate realism over many years, I hope you don’t consider that an unreasonable request.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGrand media deception
So typical of climate science. Everything in and around it gets wildly exaggerated in order to feed media consumption and deceive the public. Reports are emerging that the “500,000 people” crowd awaiting Greta in Madrid was in fact as low as 15,000, according to Spanish federal police.
That would make the 500,000 claimed figure a 3000% exaggeration!

Ms. Thunberg, media, claim crowd in photo was 500,000 people. But Spanish federal police say the crowd was closer to 15,000. Image: Greta Thunberg.
=========================================
Greta demonstration in Madrid: Crowd number – 97% is exaggeration?
By A. R. Göhring
(German text translated/edited/supplemented by P Gosselin)
After Greta Thunberg’s arrival in Madrid, there was an “unprecedented demonstration” for climate protection in the Spanish capital, supposedly involving 500,000 participants.
But the federal police say there were about 15,000 (!) demonstrators.
At German news outlets, people could read that Greta Thunberg at first had to interrupt participating at the demonstration in Madrid – because of so many people and security could not be guaranteed. Later she stood on a stage with famous Hollywood actor Javier Bardem and gave a speech.
There were, as usual, no scientific facts to be found, but a lot of feeling, self-righteousness and general demands to an ominous elite, who officially stand behind Thunberg’s FFF.

The leaders are betraying us. Enough is enough. Change comes whether you like it or not. We want to see action.” [translated from the German]

Bardem seconded: “We only have ten years to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.” He also hit the Mayor of Madrid, José Luis Martinez-Almeida, and President Donald Trump for their “stupid” measures against climate change.

Sources revealing much smaller numbers
The Spanish media, but also the Austrian ORF, are now discussing falsified numbers of participants. The mass media had spoken of 500,000 demonstrators. That would mean that Greta caused one of the largest climate protection demonstrations on the planet in Spain.
Largely empty seats in Katowice in 2018
Those who remember the coverage of the world climate conference COP24 in Katowice, Poland, know that Thunberg’s “breakthrough”, an emotional and panic-stricken speech in front of a “large” audience, had already been manipulated. In fact, the 15-year-old Swede spoke in front of largely empty rows of chairs, which was not visible in the media due to the skillful selection of photographic and film perspectives.
Police figure: only 15,000
Therefore the brash falsification of the numbers is not surprising. The organizers of the demonstration spoke of half a million participants, but the large newspaper El País spoke of 25,000 to 35,000, and the Spanish federal police of only about 15,000 people with the help of helicopter images.

Excerpt screen shot from El Pais.
Experience has shown that the police always give quite low numbers of demonstrators, but the unusual use of aerial photographs makes this figure seem convincing.
If one calculates the real number percentage of the FFF fantasy figure, then you come up with three percent. 97% of the claimed figure is presumably a lie. Demonstration organizers like to give slightly higher figures, but 30 times above reality is already extraordinary, especially in a globally important political PR campaign filmed by numerous cameras.
The knowledgeable climate sceptic is also quite familiar with the 97% figure – with respect to ex-President Barack Obama and climate psychologist John Cook. One sees how huge and audacious exaggerations / counterfeits are part of the climatic profiteering business. Isn’t that risky? Wouldn’t it be better to manipulate more cautiously so that there’s less to be accused of?
Obviously, those who don’t panic enough achieve less. Moreover, even critical citizens often would not imagine that someone would publicly falsify in such a brazen manner.

"When released in 1975, Jaws not only transformed the face of cinema, it would also change the way many of us perceived the ocean. We were exposed to a vengeful, human-eating, boat-destroying great white that although fictional, would end up haunting our relationship with sharks for decades to come. It would appear that the 40-year-old shark is still stalking many of us. The iconic tones of the theme song is still heard by many as they enter the ocean: “Da-dum, Da-dum …” A dorsal fin breaking the surface still encourages imagery reminiscent of a puppy wrestling a chew toy, only with added clouds of crimson and shrills of terror. Jaws resonated so strongly with audiences because Peter Benchley, author of the original novel, took inspiration from real-life events. Shark incidents did happen and with expanding populations, more and more people were encountering them while enjoying the ocean. Stories of “rogue” sharks caused headlines that added kindle to the embers of fear that Jaws had started. The shark had quickly become the villain that we loved to hate. Much like the chiming bell of a buoy, the film’s tagline – “Don’t go in the water” – rang loud for many people. The reality was that even with increased shark accidents the number of annual incidents was low. In 2014, only three people died from shark bites. Dogs, cows, driving and even vending machines would kill more people in 2014 than sharks did. Yet, without fully understanding the shark, many beaches would employ destructive measures in an attempt to reduce the risks. Gill nets, hunts and shark culls were adopted in an attempt to reduce the risk to ocean users, all of which would end with the death of our new “villain”. As exposure of shark incidents increased, so did our fascination with this “monster”. While no doubt responsible for the fear felt by most, the film was also a catalyst for progressing scientific research within the field of shark biology. Primarily set on mitigating the occurrences of shark attacks, we slowly began to unravel the enigmatic world of these “big fish”. Portrayed in the film as an indiscriminate killing machine capable of seeking revenge and sinking our boats, we slowly began to see there was much more behind the shark’s dark, “doll eyes” than first appeared. Research groups around the world began dedicating their work to uncovering the cryptic behaviour of these animals. We learnt of their incredible feats of transoceanic migrations, complex 3-dimensional movements and intricate population structuring. They weren’t too dissimilar to us with social interactions, learned behaviours, and even feeding preferences. These revelations were made across the shark species, from freshwater to the deep-sea.  Turns out, not all sharks were formidable apex predators and we very quickly realised that few species actually posed any threat to us whatsoever. The most alarming of all scientific discoveries however, would capsize everything we thought we knew about our relationship with sharks. Sharks are key predators within ocean habitats and are, in turn, vital components within these environments. Removal of sharks from the oceans can have disastrous effects that reverberate throughout an ecosystem. Unfortunately, sharks were under decline. With post-film popularity in trophy hunting and an on-going global expansion of fisheries, sharks were being removed from the ocean at an unprecedented rate. The fate of many would be in the soup bowls on Asian tables, where a dish called shark fin soup was being consumed on a growing scale. With estimates of 63 to 273 million sharks being killed every year, the once feared villain was now the imperilled victim. Despite scientists unanimously warning of the importance and vulnerability of shark populations, many countries are still failing to provide adequate fisheries management and regulatory enforcement to inhibit further declines. In the 40 years following the release of Jaws, it is quite remarkable the advancements we have made in understanding the ocean and its sharks. Yet, despite these advancements, countries continue to retaliate to shark incidents in much the same way that the residents of Amity Island did in Jaws: with shark hunts and culls. A recent study that evaluated the kill-based strategies adopted by Western Australia (and other countries), exposed the ineffectiveness of these destructive methods. Instead, hazard mitigation policies should focus on expanding scientific research, developing non-lethal mitigations and further improving education, outreach and public awareness/opinion. Our relationship with the shark is one riddled with complexities. After four decades of research by people inspired by these animals, education, ecotourism and fisheries regulations are improving. However, fantastical media inaccuracies and economic greed are preventing us from truly escaping the misconceived clutches of one of the ocean’s most misunderstood monsters."
"This week, among the private chalets and deep snow of Davos, the world’s leading politicians and businesspeople have been spending their time at the World Economic Forum (WEF), and they’ve been talking about the climate crisis. Greta Thunberg and Prince Charles have given stark speeches warning of the dangers of a warming world, and CEOs and presidents have promised long overdue action.  For those of us in the climate movement, this shift of focus is no surprise. Last year changed everything. From the wave of schoolchildren going on climate strike, to large scale non-violent uprisings like Extinction Rebellion, 2019 proved to be the year that people in power couldn’t hide any more from the need to act. And then Australia caught fire: no amount of money could put those fires out. With this sudden focus on climate it’s no wonder that attendees of the WEF have come under fire for their choice of transport in getting there. Prince Charles flew to the summit in a private jet, before demanding new green taxes. And he wasn’t the only one. Figures from last year suggest over 300 private jets landed for the talks – somewhat overshadowing the summit’s eco-credentials, including the carpets made from “end-of-life fishing nets” and the rooms painted with renewable resources “like seaweed”. But though the egregious use of private jets is both deeply hypocritical and climate-wrecking, it shouldn’t be the main focus of our ire. Instead, let’s look at what those sitting around this year’s mountaintop tables have on their climate record. And let’s be real about how much big corporates can plan for a carbon-free future, in light of the fact that just 100 companies have been the source of more than 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. Just 20 companies have contributed to 480bn tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent since 1965 – that’s a third of all emissions. Many of them – including the two largest emitters on Earth – are listed as “affiliates” on the WEF website. And it’s not just big oil – the financial institutions participating in the WEF are responsible for pumping at least $1.4tn into fossil fuel investments since the Paris climate agreement was signed. And then there’s the governments. Prince Charles’ speech was a powerful challenge to those in power, asking if “we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink?” But the UK government was this week revealed to be supporting fossil fuel mega projects around the world with the combined emissions of a country the size of Portugal. Such climate failure is not a byproduct of the economic system advocated by the WEF, it is baked into their model. An ideological commitment to free markets – advocated by those at Davos every year for the summit’s 50-year history – has been a consistent block to progress on the climate crisis. Just look at the world emissions data – an endless pursuit of economic expansion, of marketising every aspect of our lives, of extracting oil and gas to the point of no return, has put us on course for climate catastrophe. Climate data isn’t, as Thunberg says, “anyone’s political opinions or views”: it’s just a statement of fact. And that’s why over the last week I trekked across the mountains to Davos. Alongside 1500 people I spent three days walking from Landquart to Davos in possibly the coldest and most high-altitude climate justice march of all time. On the final day, we even managed to block the road to Davos, which has been blocking progress for a fairer and more just world the past 50 years. While Australia is burning and frontline communities all over the world are threatened by the very real consequences of the climate crisis, Davos-style meetings will never give us the answers we need. In truth, it would be foolish for anyone to expect a private club whose 1000 member companies have paid between 60,000 to 600,000 swiss francs to be a member (the more you pay the more access you have) should be trusted to solve an issue they created. A crisis of this scale needs scalable and just solutions – whether that’s a Green New Deal, divestment from fossil fuels, or decarbonisation targets in richer countries being rapidly brought forward. If the rich and famous at Davos really want to tackle the climate crisis, they should make this the last World Economic Forum. • Payal Parekh is an international climate activist and media spokesperson for the Swiss based Strike WEF Collective"
"A whistleblower from Bristol Zoo has revealed a series of unfortunate accidents involving endangered species. One involved a golden-headed lion tamarin, a small monkey native to Brazil, which fell into a pond and was killed by otters. In another incident, a male warty pig attacked his mate and killed his offspring. These critically endangered pigs are found on just two islands in the Philippines. The knee-jerk media reaction to such accidents is to directly or implicitly blame the zoo for what happened. “So much for conservation!” said the Daily Mail, which also said the zoo was “under fire”. Gawker even dubbed it the British Zoo of Horrors. However such reactions ignore something very important – it is impossible to completely eliminate accidents. Yes we should be asking whether an accident was foreseeable and therefore preventable. But we also need to consider the probability of it occurring in the first place. It is of course possible to imagine a monkey falling off a branch into a pool, but it is not highly probable.  Primates make thousands of movements per day in trees and yet rarely fall. It’s the same with us humans. I once fell on ice and broke my ankle but I knew the risk and I’d still take my chances again. Imagine a world or a zoo where we do not factor in probability when managing accident risk – a world of strict liability. Perhaps zoos should keep monkeys away from their monkey bars because of the risk of falling. When one reads the news reports about such accidents it is clear that probability does not matter – it should not have occurred full stop. Yet I wonder how many of these journalists or interviewees will be campaigning for the elimination of stairs. After all, these dangerous devices are responsible for millions of accidents and thousands of deaths each year. There is a serious issue here: if we ignore probability and try to eliminate all accidents in zoos then we will need to keep animals in padded cells. And social species could not be kept together in case one injures another one. It is after all foreseeable that these animals will compete aggressively with one another – male chimpanzees will fight for the opportunity to mate, for example. Animals living in an accident free world would have a terrible time and these animals would have minimal value for us humans in terms of education, conservation, research or leisure – the goals of modern zoos.   The case of the warty hog is similar. Males of many species can present a threat to females and their offspring. One way to eliminate this risk would be to use artificial insemination – but of course this is usually more risky than allowing natural mating.  Allowing accidents to happen in zoos simply mirrors conditions the animals experience in the wild. Monkeys may be well adapted for swinging between trees, but I have seen them fall to the ground on several occasions. Indeed, surveys have found that a third of wild primates have broken bones in their lifetime.  One of my friends saw a bear fall out of tree, which unlike my falling monkeys did not scream and remained expressionless as it fell.  The monkeys and bear all bounced got up and carried on with their lives, apparently none-the-worse for their accidents. Bears, big cats and polar bears are among the many species of mammals known to commit infanticide in the wild. My research team in Brazil even observed one incidence in wild titi monkeys.  Infanticide can even be one of the greatest sources of infant mortality for some animals. Yet there are no headlines about wild monkeys falling out of trees or polar bears eating their babies because we don’t feel responsible for the welfare of wild animals. The consideration of probability shows how absurd it is to believe we could create accident free zoos and that, even if we could, such zoos would not be in the interest of animal wellbeing."
"MPs in the UK recently voted against a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing but Lancashire, the local county council under most pressure, agreed it needed more time to make a decision. MPs also agreed that sensitive areas should be excluded, ruling out many of the UKs shale areas. The Environmental Audit Committee concluded that development was still some way off and that under the Climate Change Act, emissions from this source should fit within Britain’s 2020 obligations. Since coal-fired stations will cease under EU directives with or without fractured gas, the Tyndall Centre concluded that Britain’s reserves of shale gas might be unburnable under carbon dioxide  targets. With public concerns still unmet, any rationale appears less favourable; however the underlying factors have changed little. Between January 2014 (blue on chart) and January 2015 (red), the spot price of oil for immediate delivery fell more than 50% from above $100 to near $50 per barrel. However the price of oil for future delivery (in the centre region, say from 2017) has fallen only 30% from about $95 to $65.  Longer horizon prices of oil (on the right for 2020) remain around $80 per barrel; these prices are much less variable and offer better indicators of future demand, the need for supply and the pressures that balance the two. Thus the current situation of “contango”, with spot or immediate prices lower than those on the longer horizon (upward sloping red curve), is indicative of a short term oil glut that is not expected to persist. Oil and gas production from the North Sea is declining.  Until new energy forms and generation such as renewables can catch up, other domestic sources will be necessary or the UK will have to import more from overseas – further increasing its exposure to world market prices. With its offshore experience, the UK has a good track record on drilling and recovery and a skilled labour force. The level of environmental scrutiny and remediation is increasing for used oil rigs. Sharing this expertise with shale well developments would partially address the environmental issues; certainly it is more appropriate to have greater scrutiny of onshore work. Compared to offshore, the environmental risks of fracking are concentrated in the first year, after which residual issues are lower compared to oil platforms which need removal. Unions see the strength of this. Alongside continuity of employment and training, they have also made the case for new energy projects to be located domestically rather than in developing countries where there may be easily accessible energy but poor protections for workers and residents. In the longer run renewables will make the biggest change. However sun, wind and waves are intermittent sources without storage mechanisms for that calm winter night so complementary forms of generation are likely to be required. Gas is the most flexible of fossil fuels; it is already widely liquified for transport and import but when piped into homes for heating, it can also be used for electricity generation via Stirling engines or fuel cells which can also power cars instead of petrol. If fracking is to make a positive impact within tough carbon budgets, its gas will have to be used more efficiently and creatively than before. Rather than burning it in power stations, its biggest contributions could be to generate electricity in the home (with the heat as a by-product) or in car transport (replacing petrol and oil imports). If home and car owners have incentives to adapt their energy usage in these ways, gas will prove the transition fuel that many seek."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman online weekly FOCUS here reports how cuts by wind energy giant Enercon will lead to 3000 layoffs. According to Enercon chief executive Hans-Dieter Kettwig, “politicians have pulled the plug on wind energy.”

Subsidies cut
Once lavished with huge incentives, the German wind industry is being hit hard after the government recently ended the huge subsidies that were once aimed at expanding the installation of wind energy capacity. Power grid operators had been struggling to keep the grid stable due to erratic feed-in and the subsidized feed-in of wind energy caused German electricity prices to become among the most expensive worldwide.
Fierce opposition from hundreds of protest groups
Moreover, hundreds of citizen protest groups have sprouted and since become a formidable force pushing for the stop of proposed wind projects. Not only have wind parks scarred the German landscape and destroyed biotopes nationwide, they have also been shown to be a real health hazard to humans living in their proximity through the low frequency infrasound they emit. Enough is enough, citizens say.
3000 job cuts in the works

FOCUS reports: “The crisis in the German wind energy industry is worsening. According to the ‘Süddeutsche Zeitung’, hard cuts at the largest German manufacturer Enercon will cost 3000 jobs.”
Next year Enercon will also cut contracts with suppliers, sending a wave of job losses across the industry. “If supply contracts are terminated as planned, many of these companies are threatened with extinction,” FOCUS reports.
FOCUS notes that the layoffs will hit regions that are already economically weak. “At the Aurich and Magdeburg locations, 1500 jobs will be cut, according to the company. At the company headquarters in Aurich, 250 to 300 jobs are affected.”
Stricter regulations for wind parks, greater setback distances
Not only have the subsidies for German wind parks been cut back, but also setback rules will become more strict in order to protect homes and residents from landscape blight and infrasound. In the future, wind parks will need to keep a greater distance away from residential areas. The current  CDU/CSU/SPD government wants to keep at least one kilometer between wind power installations and residential areas in the future. This will make many proposed projects impossible.
German Greens demand the industrialization of scenic landscape
The stricter setback rules have been sharply criticized by the wind industry, and particularly by German Green party leader, Annalena Baerbock: “The planned distance rules for wind turbines are devastating,” she told network Germany RND.
“Contrary to all public announcements, the federal government is thus making further expansion of wind power impossible. This is tantamount to a boycott of the Paris Climate Treaty and its own climate targets.” Baerbock also told RND: “The federal government claims to want to get out of coal but at the same time is stopping the expansion of wind power.”

Given this gadget matches my blog namesake, you’d think maybe I invented it. Alas, though I’ve made lots of other inventions, this is not one of them.
For those of you interested in sustainability or renewable energy, your first and best defense against power waste is to look for energy that is being wasted in normal everyday use. You’d be surprised at how many of our modern electronic devices that appear to be “off” are actually wasting power and you don’t even know it. TV’s, radios, game consoles, some computers, and many rechargeable devices waste a huge amount of power.
There’s two places this happens:
1. Instant on devices: TV’s and stereos are especially bad. The convenience of having the device turn on immediately causes it to operate in standby mode, drawing a small amount of power 24/7 Some PC’s also operate this way.
2. Devices with AC plug transformers. Often called “wall-warts” these small transformers convert the 120 volts AC to a safer 6-15 volts DC to power the electronic device. Even if the device is unplugged from the transformer, the transformer continues to waste power!
The Watts Up meter can help you identify and quantify where power is being wasted and how much it is costing you. You’d be surprised.

A simple solution to the problem of home energy waste is a $5 power strip. For example I have a TV set and satellite receiver on my workshop which I use to keep abreast of news while tinkering. If I left these two devices plugged in 24/7, they’d waste about $12/year in electricity. I plugged both of them into an inexpensive power strip, enabling me to separate them from the AC power source. Since I don’t use my workshop every day, the small inconvenience of waiting for the satellite reciever to initialize (about 1 minute) is well worth the money I’ll save over the years.
Chargers are another place this could work. Cell phone chargers, MP3 player chargers, etc can all be placed on a single power strip. When the devices are fully charged or disconnected, simply turn of the power strip to end power draw.

From the “us” against “phlegm” department:
There’s a DailyMail article about the possibility of a revolutionary flu vaccine that could work against all strains of the Influenza A disease. This ‘holy grail’ of vaccines would work on everything from the annual ‘winter flu’ to the ‘bird flu’. The best part is that just a few vaccinations may provide complete immunity, unlike the annual boosters are current defenses require.

From the article:
“The new jabs would be grown in huge vats of bacterial ‘soup’, with just two pints of liquid providing 10,000 doses of vaccine. Current flu vaccines focus on two proteins on the surface of the virus. However, these constantly mutate in a bid to fool the immune system, making it impossible for vaccine manufacturers to keep up with the creation of each new strain. The universal vaccines focus on a different protein called M2, which has barely changed during the last 100 years.”
The brainchild of scientists at Cambridge biotech firm Acambis, working with Belgian researchers, the vaccine will be tested on humans for the first time in the next few months.
A similar universal flu vaccine, being developed by Swiss vaccine firm Cytos Biotechnology, could also be tested on people in 2007 – and the vaccines on the market in around five years.

"A stunning little fish that eats salmon parasites could revolutionise aquaculture by providing an eco-friendly alternative to fish medicines.  The Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is one of the world’s favourite fish, and there’s big money to be made farming it – Scotland alone exports £400m worth per year. As in most agrifood sectors, the big rewards on offer have caused the industry to consolidate into fewer, larger players. It’s also lead to major technological breakthroughs and most of the big salmon farming challenges have now been addressed, except one: sea lice. Sea lice are small crustacean parasites that live on salmon, damaging their scales, reducing growth and helping diseases spread. The industry in Scotland is spending more than £30m per year on mitigation with approved veterinary medicines being a core element of parasite control.     There is a better way. My research group, in collaboration with leading salmon farming companies, has focused on an alternative “greener” approach – the use of cleaner fish, especially ballan wrasse. Controlling parasites with a biological agent – the cleaner fish – would be unique among livestock farmed for human food, but there are good reasons to think these wrasse are up to the task as we’ve known about their cleaning powers since the 1970s. Previously evidence was mainly anecdotal however, based on observing what happened when wild cleaner fish broke into salmon cages.  If we want scale things up, to harness these powers to make fishing more sustainable then the challenge now is to farm the cleaner fish themselves. This should protect numbers in the wild as well as being a safer option for salmon farmers – farmed wrasse would be disease-free, with a standardised size and robustness.  However, we first had to determine farming (domestication) would not mean these fish stopped going after the sea lice. Would a farmed wrasse still be interested in foraging on sea lice if it had never seen one during the two years spent in fish tanks and fed on pellets? Two Stirling colleagues and I recently published a study confirming the strong innate delousing behaviour of farmed ballan wrasse. Surprisingly, even though the wrasse were each able to eat up to 175 lice per day we didn’t find their hunger levelled off. The fish enjoy eating parasites, but they still don’t feel full. Supplementary feed is still needed. We also found size did not really matter, larger fish not being more effective than smaller ones. This means we can figure out the optimum wrasse deployment – numbers and size relative to salmon and sea pens and so on – and it also means the wrasse can be fed while cohabiting with salmon. Ballan wrasse aren’t the tastiest fish, though they are often used in the French “bouillabaisse” soup. However the species does have a number of striking features – and not just its looks. Their reproduction strategy is unusual. All ballan wrasse are born females and then undergo a sex inversion into males at a later stage of their life cycle (a phenomenon known as hermaphroditism protogynous). Their behaviour can be odd: they truly sleep at night which is not common in fish, the younger fish have a habit of grouping together in a ball, and of course they enjoy delousing. The fish also have no stomach, and a bile pigment causes their plasma to be blue. All this means scientists find ballan wrasse fascinating but it doesn’t make farming them any easier. In marine aquaculture, the first stages of life are generally the toughest to get right as the supply of eggs can be unreliable and lots of fish die off before they are fully developed. But things are improving. We can now better manage breeders and optimise egg production and fish survival, thanks to a range of tools developed to identify gender and manipulate sex on demand if required, assess reproductive conditions, remove the stickiness from the newly spawned eggs which simplifies the disinfection from potential pathogens, synchronise hatching and successfully produce robust fish in the hatchery. All of these resulted in the first commercial batches of farmed ballan wrasse in the hatchery and significant numbers of fish deployed to salmon farms.  Over the past few years we’ve made significant progress and the industry has even completed full 16-18 month salmon production cycles at sea without using any medicine to control sea lice. We’ve just been given a grant to continue our research so look out for further developments. It’s clear that cleaner fish really can be an effective way to keep salmon clean and healthy."
"Western liberal democracies believe that in difficult political decisions science serves as a referee and arbiter of truth. Scientific knowledge can indeed inform and narrow the scope of policy choices, for example in the teaching of evolution in public schools. But a staunch belief in a fully rational society, together with a political culture of adversarialism and the scepticism of vested interest groups can also create a fertile soil for controversy and a political deadlock. While we have come to know a lot about interest groupsʼ smoothly oiled denial campaign to influence public opinion on climate change, very little has been said about the institutional mechanisms exacerbating the political stalemate between Democrats and Republicans. In order to gain political support in the US, scientists are frequently asked to articulate, represent and defend their knowledge in congressional hearings. To this end, Democrats and Republicans choose experts independently. They then put the scientists under oath and start their cross-examination. Truth, they insist, would emerge only from aggressive testing in an adversarial forum. Of course, the purpose of congressional hearings on science most often is not to actually expand or clarify the scope of choice available to decision makers, nor to convince neutrals or to win over the other side to one’s point of view. Rather, these hearings are meant to show and confirm solidarity with one’s own side. In this sense, they mark a breakdown of democratic deliberation. In their floor speeches Republicans and Democrats subscribe to the so-called linear model of science and society. This describes a sequential process by which basic or fundamental research results in technical innovation and public policies. There’s little empirical evidence this is how things actually work but nonetheless it remains the organising principle of congressional hearings on scientific matters. Paired with the belief that truth emerges from aggressive testing, congressional hearings create the perfect conditions for a political opponent to deconstruct the basic of fundamental research. Such often openly hostile hearings date back to at least the DDT controversy in the 1960s when Democrat representatives invited legendary ecologist Rachel Carson to testify on the petrochemicalʼs detrimental effects on the environment. Democrats wanted Carson to make a scientific case for the regulation of the petrochemical industry, and thereby (unwittingly?) provoked the sceptical deconstruction of environmental science. When Republicans invited experts who questioned the presented consensus, a political debate quickly turned into a narrow technical one about the scientific method, uncertainties, and the scientistsʼ alleged conflict of interests. DDT sceptics from the right adopted a strategy the left had pursued for many decades: they employed a Marxist critique of the social and economic foundation not of capitalist but of environmentalist science. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was able to frame its eventual ban as a rational decision, circumventing a value-laden discussion about the merits of a system that has allowed a few industries to benefit at the cost of the general public To be sure, the Democrats succeeded because their political programme of action could be brought into alignment with science: the decision made in the 1970s was politically and economically viable as the industry moved overseas to create new markets for their products. Science can’t always be brought into alignment with those wider political and economic rationales. Public opposition to major companies has kept GM food out of European supermarkets, for example. It doesn’t matter that the purported health risks cannot be scientifically substantiated. For politicians, the potential loss of credibility from being seen to go along with Monsanto and co is not worth the scientific upside.  Congressional hearings on climate science continue in that tradition. Since the late 1980s the Democrats have convened hearings and invited “their” experts in the hope that science would legitimise their policy proposals. We have all heard of climate scientist James Hansen’s emphatic 1988 testimony that “it’s time to stop waffling so much and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.” In turn, the Republicans invited experts who issued statements questioning respective claims. This happened frequently under the Bush administration, for example in hearings convened by the Republicans James Inhofe, Ed Whitfield and Joe Barton. Seizing the Republican majority in both chambers, their hearings on the so-called hockey stick climate reconstruction functioned as a veto put on a legislative process that has been facing resistance long before esoteric scientific questions attracted politicians’ attention. Unsurprisingly, when the Democrats regained a majority they fought back. Two of the latest hearings featured briefings grandly entitled “A Rational Discussion of Climate Change: The Science, the Evidence, the Response” and “Undeniable Data: The Latest Research on Global Temperature and Climate Science”. Convened by Democrats Edward Markey and Henry Waxman these hearings should set the scientific record straight and reinforce the difficult legislative process. But subpoenaing testimony from intimidated scientists in order to influence the policy process has proven ineffective at best – since neither party takes their opponent’s expert advice seriously – and counter-productive at worst – since it simply reinforces the stalemate between Democrats and Republicans. On a discursive level these hearings havenʼt achieved much. The idea that truth is best served through adversarialism and the clash of competing viewpoints before a judge and jury turns esoteric scientific controversies into fully fledged public debates. This adversarial procedure is typical for how the litigious US society warrants scientific knowledge for policy-making. It has come to characterise the climate change debate. By contrast, in the UK the assumption of trust and mutual respect still guides the relationship between scientific advisers and government. The option of subpoenaing testimony from scientists is rarely exercised. Instead, in a consensual decision, parliament invites and asks for advice a chief scientist who is recognised as the authoritative and trusted voice on scientific matters of fact. This does not mean that the goals set in the UK Climate Change Act are achievable. They are probably not. But the procedure by which the UK uses science to influence policy doesnʼt drive a wedge between scientists and politicians. What humble and sane climate scientist would still want to accept an invitation to Congress?"
"For millions of livestock owners across Africa, a disease in the herd can mean hardship or even ruin. Access to effective veterinary treatment is therefore essential for many people’s livelihoods.  Many factors can make getting good treatment difficult, such as a shortage of vets and the high cost of care.  To make things worse, counterfeit or substandard drugs have penetrated many marketplaces, and are often hard to tell apart from the real thing. While regulators scramble to catch up with this problem, livestock owners must work out their own ways of coping. The quality of medicine for humans has long been a major public health problem, particularly in developing countries. Products are sometimes sold without little or no active ingredient or without correct labelling – sometimes imitating the packaging of well-known companies. Such deceptions can be as simple as a shopkeeper diluting bottled medicines, or involve sophisticated international criminal networks.  The true scale of the problem is difficult to pinpoint, though some research indicates that fake and substandard drugs are a significant proportion of all drugs sold globally, and are a multi-billion dollar industry. In the past decade, there have been impressive efforts to tackle the human drug quality problem. However, the issue of veterinary drug safety and security remains largely below the radar.  The International Federation of Animal Health estimates that the trade in sub-standard and non-registered drugs in Africa is worth US$400m a year – the same size as the official market. The manufacturers, sellers, and customers I’ve spoken to over believe that the problem has been around for decades, but has got much worse in the last five to ten years. Some research has tried to estimate the quality of drugs that treat trypanosomiasis and other animal diseases. But it remains frustratingly difficult to get a clear view of the problem. This is in part because testing drug quality is difficult – even where facilities exist, it can cost several hundred US dollars to test a single sample.  As considerable progress has been made in cleaning up the human drug market, why has Africa’s veterinary drug problem been left behind? One reason is that since the 1980s, public veterinary services in many African countries have been greatly reduced. This decline has had far-reaching consequences, not least in the loss of network of veterinarians well-placed to identify and report dubious products. More broadly, the withdrawal of public veterinary services means that many livestock owners are forced to improvise when looking after their animals. Diseases must be tackled with a patchwork of private veterinarians, “paravets” and livestock workers (with variable levels of training), and local knowledge. A lot can go wrong in this Wild West free-for-all: diseases with similar symptoms can be easily misdiagnosed, mistakes can be made in the tricky task of judging doses correctly, and even good quality drugs can be rendered useless by being stored incorrectly or used after their expiry date. Because of this, fake or substandard drugs are just one possible cause amongst many for treatment failure – meaning that it is difficult to definitely prove that a particular batch of drugs is substandard. My own research with Fulani pastoralists in Nigeria’s middle belt demonstrates that cattle owners are well aware of the presence of dubious products. Customers are not always able to reliably identify dubious products – a fake pill does not come apart at the seams like a fake pair of Levi’s. Instead, they systematically experiment with small quantities of several drugs to identify effective ones, and use medicines in careful combinations to avoid the risk of failure in any one product. Nigerian urban elites often discuss Fulani cattle owners with a certain condescension. But the Fulani are far from passive victims: building on their expertise and efforts to secure good quality treatment would be a good place for regulators and veterinary authorities to start. To tackle the human drug quality problem in Nigeria, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has followed a uncompromising strategy of prosecutions and well-publicised seizures and burnings of drugs. While these efforts have been rightly celebrated, improving veterinary drug safety may require a different approach. Many in Nigeria prescribe and sell veterinary drugs without the necessary licences – but it would achieve little to harshly prosecute such vendors when government support and regulation has been ineffective for so long. A better approach might emphasise training for both vendors and customers of drugs, alongside more rigorous licensing and investigations. NAFDAC launched a new veterinary and animal products directorate in 2013 to address these issues, which along with the good reputation of the agency is cause for optimism.  There is urgent need for more research across the continent, cheaper ways of testing drugs, and most of all, better use of livestock owners’ own knowledge and skills."

Image above: Dubbed the “Swan” this X-ray image shows massive energy releases from the sun’s magnetic field, even while we are at the solar minimum in between sunspots cycles.
Last week, on the same day Al Gore was giving testimony to congress on made-made CO2 being the sole cause of Global Warming, NASA called a press conference in Washington DC to announce some spectacular new findings about the sun. Of course everybody in the press was so busy covering Gore’s big day, there was hadly any mention of what NASA announced.
What they announced was that a new X-ray imaging satellite called HINODE, launched in September 2006, has seen the first images that  explain one of the biggest mysteries of the sun: why the corona is hotter than the suns surface. Magnetic reconnection seems to be the key, and these images go a long ways towards proving the theory.
But even more importantly, scientists expected to see a very quiet sun with the new x-ray imager, since we are at solar minimum right now. NASA announced we’d reached solar min on March 6th. The fact that the HINODE scientists saw huge explosive energy bursts even while the surface of the sun is nearly devoid of sunspots tells them that the suns magnetic field is still tremendously active. The suns magnetic field has been getting more active for the past hundred years, coincidentally at the same time CO2 on earth has been increasing along with the global mean temperature.

But it seems that coincidence makes CO2 a Red Herring.
The linkage between changes in the suns magnetic field and earths climate has been well documented. Global temps closely track solar cycles as measured by sunspot intensity. Sunpots are proxy indicators of changes in the suns magnetic field. The Danish Meteorological Institute first reported the correlation in a study going back centuries. Historic data reveal that whenever the sun got more active, the earth heated up, and vice versa. The best correlation was the Maunder Minimum.

But until now, we could not see energy being transported away from the sun via its magentic field, which is why many in the environmental community doubt the role of the sun in climate change. We couldn’t visualize the sun’s magnetic output. This new tool is going to open a whole new era of understanding how the sun works, and more importantly how changes on the sun link to climate changes on earth.
Of course I’m sure Mr. Gore will find a way to explain this away, since we can’t have any new science getting in the way of a “consensus” and a “debate thats over”.
Inconveniently, NASA also announced last week a new study that shows a clear sun-earth linkage in records kept by Eqyptians of the Nile river, rainfall, and auroral activity which is a direct indicator of solar activity. It seems the sun-earth climate linkage has been around way before SUV’s.
So what’s easier to believe as the cause of climate change? That a trace gas called CO2 that has increased on earth from about 280 PPM to 380 PPM in the last 100 years is the cause, or that the giant nuclear fireball a thousand times bigger than earth a mere 8 light-minutes away has been getting more active during the same period is the reason?

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s certainly no misperception that global warming alarmists have become far more shrill over the past months with ever wilder, more sensational claims about how the climate is getting more dangerous.
Making up facts
For example, in his COP25 opening speech, many of the claims made by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres outright flunked the reality test, were exposed to be outlandish and seemed to be completely made up.
At Twitterm, Timjbo tweeted some Sky News footage of a statement made by the UN Secretary General, followed by a fact-check:
 Climate related disasters are becoming more frequent, more deadly, more destructive with growing human and financial cost.”

Many of Mr Guterres’ assertions in his opening speech #COP25 didn't stand up to scrutiny, including his claim a record number of people are dying due to climate-related disasters. @CraigKellyMP #Outsiders 
Not true, the #UN is after cash.

“Incredible 98% reduction” in climate deaths since 1930
The footage of Guterres is then followed by a Sky News panel analysis at Sky News, which featured MP Craig Kelly, who said that Guterres told three untruths in a single sentence.
First, Guterres claims a greater number of deaths from climate-related disasters, but this is untrue as the data chart show:

Lie no. 1: More climate-related deaths. Reality: 98% reduction since 1930!

Guterres is saying the exact opposite of what is true
Kelly shows that climate-related deaths are “at the lowest level in history”.
“There’s been a 98% decline, an incredible 98% decline since the 1930s,” said Kelly. “And this year we’ll get the lowest number of deaths from climate-related  disasters, ever!”
Kelly slams the UN Secretary General for saying the “exact opposite of what is true.”
Lie number 2: increasing number of climate related disasters
Also shown by Sky News is a chart depicting the number of reported natural disasters since 2000.

It’s a lie that climate-related disasters have increased.
Lies for cash = fraud
Here as well climate-related disasters have fallen steadily since 2000.
Kelly believes that money is behind all the falsehoods. “The UN is after cash,” Kelly says. He adds: “Now when someone makes false and misleading statements asking for cash, that is called fraud.”
Lie no. 3: “The costs of disasters is increasing.”
The third lie in the Secretary General’s whopper statement was saying the costs of disasters was rising. But here as well the data tell the opposite story:

"Former US vice-president Al Gore has tried to mobilise the global elite to fight the climate crisis by comparing it to some of history’s greatest battles, from Agincourt to Dunkirk. Gore told delegates at the World Economic Forum in Davos that the scale of the climate emergency was much worse than people recognise, and getting worse much faster than people recognise.  “The burden to act on the shoulders of the generation of the people alive today is a challenge to our moral imagination,” said Gore, during a session on protecting the Amazon and developing sustainable markets. “This is Thermopylae. This is Agincourt. This is the Battle of the Bulge. This is Dunkirk. This is 9/11,” declared Gore. “We have to rise to this occasion.” Gore, who has campaigned on environmental issues since losing the 2000 presidential race, added that the world currently lacks the requisite political will to tackle the emergency. “But remember, political will is itself a renewable resource,” he added, to applause from the audience. Jane Goodall, the English primatologist and anthropologist, called for more education and funding to help young people tackle the crisis. “My hope is that we can increase the level of education and understanding, not only but especially among our youth, and increase the level of funding so they can do more,” she said. “The young people know what needs to be done, but very often there aren’t the resources for them to actually do it,” Goodall added."
"The former prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has said he “can’t explain” Scott Morrison’s behaviour during Australia’s unprecedented bushfire crisis and that his successor had “downplayed” the catastrophe and had not behaved the way a prime minister should. Turnbull made the extraordinary criticism of Morrison during an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, in which he also blamed News Corp and rightwing thinktanks in Australia for promoting climate change denialism.  He “could not explain” why Morrison had refused to meet former fire chiefs – who early last year attempted to warn him of the risks posed by the coming fire season – and then decided to holiday in Hawaii in the midst of the crisis in December. “Everybody knew we were in a very dry time and as a consequence the fire season was likely to be very bad,” Turnbull said. “So rather than doing what a leader should do and preparing people for that, he downplayed it – and then of course chose to go away on holiday in Hawaii at the peak of the crisis. “I can’t explain any of that. It’s not consistent with the way in which a prime minister would and should act.” Morrison cut short his family holiday to Hawaii after two volunteer firefighters in New South Wales died. He came home two days early and apologised, saying he “deeply regretted” any offence caused. But he was then heckled on a visit to the fire-ravaged town of Cobargo in NSW, where three people died, and mistakenly said that nobody had died on South Australia’s Kangaroo Island, where two people had died. “I do not know why Scott Morrison has acted the way he has,” Turnbull said. “I’ve known him for 20 years, at least. I can’t explain his conduct.” Morrison’s personal approval rating and rating as preferred prime minister fell in the first polls after the bushfire season began. “I can’t explain why he didn’t meet the former fire commissioners who wanted to see him in March last year to talk about the gravity of the threat,” Turnbull said. In November the former fire chiefs said Morrison had turned down a meeting with them because his government “fundamentally doesn’t like talking about climate change”. Turnbull also criticised the role of rightwing politics in Australia and the Murdoch press in promoting climate denialism. “If you go to any of the rightwing thinktanks or read the Murdoch press it is just full of climate denialism,” he said. “And it is designed to deflect from the real objective which has to be to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. “To be a climate change denier is a badge of honour on the right wing of politics here and in the US, and it is mad.” Turnbull said Australia was “in the frontline of the consequences” and needed to act on the climate crisis to show the world that it was important. “How many more coral reefs have to be bleached, how many more million hectares of forest have to be burned?” he asked. “How many more lives and homes have to be lost before the climate change deniers acknowledge they are wrong? “If a country like Australia is not prepared to grapple with this issue seriously, itself being in the frontline of the consequences and being an advanced, prosperous, technologically sophisticated country, with the means to do so, then why would other countries take the issue as seriously as they should?” On Tuesday Morrison said reducing fuel loads with hazard reduction burns was at least as important as reducing carbon emissions to prevent future bushfire disasters. “Hazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so because it has an even more direct practical impact on the safety of a person going into a bushfire season,” he told the Australian. In November former heads of the NSW, Queensland, Victorian and Tasmanian fire services said they were not allowed “to utter the words ‘climate change’” even though it contributed to longer, more intense bushfires. “Bushfires are a symptom of climate change,” said Neil Bibby, the former chief executive of Victoria’s Country Fire Authority. “Firefighters are the immune system that gets rid of that symptom. But [the problem is] still there.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterVictoria Falls ignoring IPCC science: Sometimes more water, sometimes less
By Die kalte Sonne
(German text translated by P. Gosselin)
German Spiegel Online on 7 December 2019:
Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe and Zambia: “It’s the longest dry period that we have ever had.”
The Victoria Falls are considered to be the widest waterfall in the world. But instead of the usual quantities that plunge into its depths, there is a drought – tourists have also gone absent. The mood there is gloomy.”
And, of course, it is being immediately attempted to explain the water flow with man-made climate change. The Guardian wrote on the same day:
Data from the Zambezi River Authority shows water flow at its lowest since 1995, and well under the long-term average. Zambian president, Edgar Lungu, has called it ‘a stark reminder of what climate change is doing to our environment’.”
Spiegel calls it the worst drought ever. The Guardian calls it the worst drought since 1995. That’s a small difference.
As always, it’s best to look at the hard data. Here we look into a report by Richard Beilfuss from 2012 (pdf here), which has the following exciting title:
A Risky Climate for Southern African Hydro: assessing hydrological risks and consequences for Zambezi River Basin Dams “
The report checks whether dams along the Zambezi River are always supplied with sufficient water. In the event of water shortages, the turbines would quickly stop and the production of electricity would fail. Therefore, Beilfuss looks back into the hydrological past of the Zambezi region to better understand the variability of rainfall. He embeds his research in the usual climate change narrative, which we can overlook.
We are particularly interested in the facts presented by Beilfuss. From his summary:

The Zambezi River Basin has one of the most variable climates of any major river basin in the world, with an extreme range of conditions across the catchment and through time. Average annual rainfall varies from more than 1,600 mm per year in some far northern highland areas to less than 550 mm per year in the water-stressed southern portion of the basin.
Runoff is highly variable across the basin, and from year to year. The entire Zambezi River Basin is highly susceptible to extreme droughts (often multi-year droughts) and floods that occur nearly every decade. Droughts have considerable impact on river flows and hydropower production in the basin. For example, during the severe 1991/92 drought, reduced hydropower generation resulted in an estimated US$102 million reduction in GDP, $36 million reduction in export earnings, and the loss of 3,000 jobs.”
Oh, man. The Zambezi area is already well known as a highly variable rain area. Can a drought be surprising at all? Why is this drought man-made in 2019, when there have apparently always been droughts in the past?
Not CO2 related
A little later in the report we also find a flow diagram for the Victoria Falls:

Figure: Water flow rate-volume at the Victoria Falls an den 1907-2006. Source: Beilfuss 2012 (immediately pdf)
We see a strong variability from year to year. On a scale of several decades, the period 1940-1980 is characterized by particularly high flow rates. The early 20th century was rather dry. A coupling to the 60-year-old ocean cycle offers itself. The Pacific is far away, but the wet Zambezi phase fits quite well into the negative PDO:

Working hypothesis: Whenever the PDO is positive, the flow at the Victoria Falls decreases. And what is PDO doing right now? It is positive. It fits!

It’s a pity that so few take the trouble to first check the natural precipitation dynamics and possible correlations.
It’s so much easier to simply hold the universal rogue CO2 reflexively responsible for every observed rain anomaly. Naturally, this quick fix is not sustainable. In this specific case, it was probably just a matter of dark climate alarmist background music for the climate conference in Madrid.

The picture above of a thunderstorm over Upper Bidwell Park was taken by my Bidwell Ranch Weather Station Webcam at http://www.bidwellranchcam.com this summer.
Weather in the mountainous portion of upper park can sometime be pretty unpredictable, with storms forming quickly due to upslope winds which cause an Orographic Lifting effect aiding the quick formation of a storm.
You may have read in the Sunday ER about the new Outdoor Planetarium  at the Kiwanis Chico Community Observatory and some of the hi-tech gadgetry there.
Today I’m pleased to announce that I completed the installation of the first ever weather station in Upper Bidwell Park at the Observatory and it is available for online access at the Observatory web page at: http://www.chicoobservatory.com/weather.htm It displays new weather data every 15 minutes plus logs the entire day’s weather for use later. I often get requests for rainfall data for Big Chico Creek watershed, and there is virtually none. This will help.

The weather station will soon have its own live webcam, the picture in the weather graphic online now is from the Bidwell Ranch Cam.
When the new webcam is installed, it will overlook the Horsehsoe Lake fishing pier. Besides the camera being a bit of deterrent for rascally behavior, the new upper park weather station will also give hikers, bikers, and golfers an ideas of what the weather is like there right now, which will aid in choosing what to wear and what gear to bring. It will help observatory staff determine if viewing is likely that night. It will also display inside the observatory, and be linked to a network of weather stations around town for an even bigger project I’m working on to create a temperature and wind model to assist in an important public health service need. More on that in the future.
This is a free community service. Enjoy it with my compliments.

"Smartphones may have been around for a while but demand for digital traffic is still growing fast. During the new year celebrations, mobile providers in the UK and Australia reported a 50% increase in traffic compared to last year, while in Taiwan mobile data more than doubled.  This is because mobile device availability, functionality and connectivity are increasingly creating the possibility of sending greetings to many others in different ways.   It isn’t just “special events” like New Year’s Eve or the record-breaking traffic generated by Apple’s iOS upgrade that we should worry about. Underlying such sudden demand peaks is an ongoing, steady increase of total demand. In Europe, recent years have shown typical increases of 30% every six months for home broadband and 15% for mobile (cellular) data. But given the resources marshalled to support continued rises in data volume and ever-faster speeds, we should also be debating what kinds of digital services have real social importance. It’s great that it’s so easy to keep in contact with close friends and family, almost anywhere in the world. Yet a time when we are battling to keep carbon emissions under control, can we really justify the energy consumption involved in streaming cat videos in ever-higher definition? Much of the energy and carbon burden of more data and more speed is buried in network infrastructure and hidden away in data centres, easily ignored by people in bedrooms and offices, but not by the global climate.   But what is all this movement of data for?  Ostensibly, about half of it is for staying in touch with others, and watching and listening to media. The rise of Facebook, YouTube and Skype is supported by larger data allowances, faster speeds, and more reliable and affordable home and mobile connections. This goes hand-in-hand with increasing numbers of smartphones, tablets, and internet-connected televisions. More data to more devices all day and night pushes us to faster infrastructure that is active a greater proportion of the time.  This in turn means more energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions.  Figuring out exactly how much more demand and emissions is difficult as it involves many unknowns, from the originating data centre right through to the computer or phone at the other end.  But we do know the following: sharing photos or videos is more energy-intensive than sending a text message or making a phone call; that video streaming tends to require more energy than broadcast television; and that listening and watching on smartphones and tablets adds to, rather than wholly supplants, the hours that TVs are watched.  Demand for consumption and the means to consume are joined at the hip – they constitute each other.  This has resulted in escalation: higher-speed and more widespread infrastructure has made feasible new data-hungry services such as Netflix. This in turn has spurred higher speeds and more pervasive infrastructure allowing higher demand.   Indeed, fast connections mean people have made more intensive use of on-demand streaming services. No one binge-watched a whole TV series through a dial-up connection. But enterprising companies are also making use of faster connections. Unsatisfied with regular high-definition video, Netflix developed “super HD” which increases data demand by 11-50% and led to significant increases in traffic for some internet service providers. More recently, the introduction of Facebook’s “autoplay”, which streams shared videos and adverts automatically, caused massive traffic surges.   Innovations such as these mean that even if the time we spend digitally sharing, chatting, or watching doesn’t rise, the amount of data demanded does. Real and anticipated rises in demand tend to be framed as needs which must be met, despite the fact that there was no such need before. Connecting those without broadband is important, but most of the focus remains on speeding up everyone else. Look, for instance, at the talk about the need for “ultrafast” broadband of up to one gigabit per second, when industry regulator Ofcom’s own report shows that just 10 Mbit per second is what we might expect for a home. Thus far the debate over this ever-increasing connectivity has primarily been about who should pay for, or profit from, the traffic, and equality of (speedy) access. But the increasing emissions this generates are a global problem which demands a solution far beyond the ins and outs of broadband policy. We need more purposeful planning of capacity and speed, and their justifiable limits – which in the end, there surely must be. By contrast, the current strategy – predict-and-provide, followed by more predict-and-provide – can only make January 1, 2016 a chance to set another new record."

Share this...FacebookTwitterPaleoclimate evidence shows there is little to no link between atmospheric CO2 concentration and relative sea level.
Venice, the treasure of Italy, is a city built on a mud swamp. Consequently, in the last 100 years it has sunk about 25 cm, or 2.5 millimeters per year (Munaretto et al., 2012).
The lagoon city had its worst flooding event ever recorded in 1966, when CO2 concentrations were still about 320 ppm.
Last week Venice flooded again, and, as expected, journalists blamed climate change and rising atmospheric CO2.
However, when we consider sea level rise rates for Venice averaged 2.6 mm/yr during 1872-1969, but then decelerated to 0.7 mm/yr for 1970-2000 (Munaretto et al., 2012), these trends are the opposite of what would be expected if CO2 emissions were driving sea level rise.

Pisa’s history provides a sea level perspective
Italy’s Pisa is famous for its leaning tower.
The city was originally built on the coast of the sea about 13 centuries before the common era (~3300 years ago). At that time, sea levels were meters higher than they are now despite the low (~270 ppm) CO2 concentrations.

During the Roman Warm Period, Pisa was still close enough to the sea coast (~4 km) to be a busy harbour (Huissen and de Graauw, 2019), accessible by canal. Dozens of ships dating to Roman times have been found buried beneath the city in recent decades.
In the last 2000 years, however, sea levels have retreated so thoroughly that Pisa now sits 9.7 km from the sea coast.

Italy’s sea level during the last interglacial
About 130,000 to 120,000 years ago, or during the last interglacial, CO2 levels peaked at 280 ppm.
Yet along the coasts of central Italy there are marine mollusck shells buried in silty sand and clay 12-35 m above today’s sea levels dating to this time period (Marra et al., 2019).

Image Source: Marra et al., 2019
In sum, the record of coastal changes throughout both ancient times and in the modern era do not support the conclusion CO2 levels are a driver of sea level change.

"If you ask the climate negotiators gathering in Bonn this week for their last get-together before the Paris conference in December who they are doing all this for, the reply would probably mention future generations. You can be as cynical as you like about what actually drives them but most people, including the negotiators themselves, no doubt think that the point of the exercise is to protect the interests of the planet as a whole. But is it? And whose planet are they trying to protect? Worryingly, the basic negotiating framework of the UN climate process increasingly favours the interests of people alive today over future generations, in ways that perhaps even the negotiators themselves do not understand. At the heart of the problem is the challenge of setting priorities between two very different kinds of climate pollutant. On the one hand, we have cumulative pollutants such as carbon dioxide, which build up in the climate system like heavy metals in the food chain. On the other, we have short-lived pollutants like methane and soot, which are “washed out” naturally within a few weeks or years. Action on short-lived pollutants has become very fashionable. It has an entire movement devoted to it, the Climate and Clear Air Coalition, enthusiastically supported by the United Nations Environment Programme. The reasons are clear: unlike carbon dioxide, many of these emissions can be reduced cheaply, with massive immediate benefits to human health and agriculture in precisely the countries where these emissions come from. Who could possibly object to measures that would save the lungs and lives of women in developing countries and at the same time could help improve our prospects of keeping global temperatures below two degrees? But there is a problem. As I explain in a new report released by the Oxford Martin School, as long as carbon dioxide emissions are still rising – and last year’s blip notwithstanding, they are – emissions of short-lived climate pollutants are almost entirely irrelevant to peak warming. The reason is simple: because carbon dioxide accumulates in the system, stabilising temperatures at any level means we have to get net global carbon dioxide emissions to zero. Even on the most heroic assumptions about future reductions, until carbon dioxide emissions are falling, and falling fast, net zero is still many decades off – by which time today’s methane and soot emissions will have long since washed out of the climate system. So why are countries so enthusiastic about them? Part of the reason is obscurely technical. For reasons long since forgotten, the whole UN process is based on the notion of “carbon dioxide equivalent” emissions, with equivalence measured in terms of a kind of “exchange rate” called the “100-year global warming potential”. Given the name, you might be forgiven for thinking this was something to do with global warming over 100 years, but it isn’t. It turns out GWP100 actually measures the relative impact of different emissions on warming rates over the next 30-40 years. And on this timescale, cutting short-lived climate pollutants could indeed have some impact.  Halving global methane emissions immediately, for example, could cut expected global temperatures by a couple of tenths of a degree by 2050 – which would be useful, but only comparable to natural fluctuations on these timescales. Halving global CO2 emissions would have a much bigger impact (and an immeasurably bigger impact after 2050), but would also be far, far more difficult and expensive. So much of the UN process is constructed around a measure of the impact of different emissions that explicitly focuses on the interests of the generation of decision-makers alive today. To be fair, some countries, like Brazil, have been calling for years for GWP100 to be replaced. But just replacing it with another exchange rate won’t help, because any rate that works on one timescale will fail on another. The solution is extremely simple. Countries need to acknowledge the need to get net carbon dioxide emissions to zero and limit the total amount we dump in the atmosphere in the meantime. So until CO2 emissions are falling, and falling fast enough that there is a realistic prospect of getting them to zero in the foreseeable future, we avoid the temptation of pretending that action on short-lived climate pollutants is helping to limit peak warming. This issue arouses strong passions: colleagues and I were recently accused by fellow scientists of putting “tens of millions of lives” at risk by calling for a delay in including short-lived climate pollutants in the UN climate process.  Let me be clear: I am all in favour of cutting soot emissions in developing countries. My first job, back in the 1980s, was developing clean and efficient wood-stoves in East Africa. I well recall the infernal conditions experienced by women cooking over open fires in 40 degree heat: we don’t need a global climate treaty to need a reason to do something about this kind of thing.  But until carbon dioxide emissions are falling, we shouldn’t pretend cutting soot emissions is helping to stabilise global temperatures, because it isn’t. So a crucial test of whether the UN climate process is actually working in the interests of future generations is whether the negotiators in Bonn, and in Paris in December, acknowledge the need for net zero carbon dioxide emissions. Watch this space."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor those wondering how Greta Thunberg managed to get so off the rails  look no further than her climate advisors. They are among the most alarmist worldwide.
According to the online, German-language Merkur.de here, citing Swedish daily Expressen, 16-year old climate activist is advised by Professor Stefan Rahmstorf, among others, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany.
Wild science claims

Professor Rahmstorf and the Potsdam Institute are well known among the climate science community for their highly alarmist projections and off-the-mark science. For example, the PIK’s former director, Prof. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, once preposterously claimed the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2030 and the world would explode with 9 billion people on it.
Alarmism as a business model
According to the Merkur, the PIK has “created a business model with climate change”, adding: “It advises state institutions and municipalities on how they can protect themselves against the severe climate changes predicted by PIK.”

The Merkur reports how Greta and Professor Rahmstorf “have met on several occasions” and how the 16-year old “calls the professor for advice.” Rahmstorf praises the teenager, saying “she knows a lot about climate science” and argues that politicians too should adopt Greta’s doomsday visions.

“Holy anger” and “religious exaggeration” 
But now some are speaking up against the excessive alarmism.
Not only are some media questioning Rahmstorf’s alarmist climate science, though it makes for good headlines, but so are other experts, such as renowned geologist Stefan Kröpelin, or Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt, or veteran meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann.
Swiss meteorologist Kachelmann calls Rahmstorf a “climate-Ratzinger”, alluding to former Pope Benedict XVI, earlier known as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. Kachelmann, a warmist, has become turned off by the fiery Potsdam professor’s “religious exaggeration” and “holy anger” in the climate debate.
“Climate howler”
The two heavyweights recently even argued on Twitter about whether a piece of broken glass could trigger a forest fire, as Rahmstorf claims, or not. The sharp-witted, media-savvy Kachelmann recently characterized claims made by Rahmstorf as “potsdaft” – an allusion to his place of work –  and labelled him a Klimaheuler, a ‘climate howler’.
Surrounded by alarmists, rational voices not welcome

Greta Thunberg’s other advisors include Swedish Professor Johan Rockström (53) and British Professor Kevin Anderson (57), both devout alarmists. Non-alarmist climate experts and rational voices are not welcome by Thunberg and her advisors. Why ruin a good business model?

Recently Japanese scientist Dr. Kiyohiko Ikeda (@IkedaKiyohiko) retweeted about a newspaper book review appearing in the Sankei Shinbum, which reported on how Marc Morano’s best selling “The Politically Incorrect Guide To Climate Change” was hitting the book market in Japan.

今日の産経に、地球温暖化の不都合な真実がありました。いよいよ地球温暖化、CO₂削減とは何だったか、明らかにされています。国連の気候変動サミットも、色あせて、白々しく感じたものでした。風力発電のアホらしさは最初から分かっているのに、なぜ被害を拡大したのか。悪党よ pic.twitter.com/0yFnfS8KXL
— 由良　守生 (@zan4736511) October 8, 2019

Mr. Morano’s Politically Incorrect Guide book had been recently released in the Japanese version, translated from the English by Tadashi Watanabe, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry of the University of Tokyo and Professor of Tokyo University of Science Graduate School.
Mann lost in court
The Sankei Shimbun book review, authored by Shohei Nagatsuji, explains how this summer an event occurred and challenges the foundation on which the existing IPCC bases its CO2 global warming theory, but which went unreported in Japan. This August, the reliability of Dr. Michael Mann’s hockey stick graph was rocked after he had lost a defamation case against a Canadian researcher [Dr. Tim Ball], who had sharply criticized the hockey stick graph.
“Hundreds of factors” behind climate change
The Sankei Shimbun also reports how Mr. Marc Morano’s book -「地球温暖化」の不都合な真実』- presents the criticisms of Prof. Mann and the inside workings of IPCC.

The Japanese daily explains how Morano’s book cites scientists who say “temperature is mainly determined by water vapor and clouds, so even if CO2 is doubled or tripled, the situation would be almost the same” and that there are in fact “hundreds of factors contributing to climate change.”

Marc Morano’s best selling “The Politically Incorrect Guide To Climate Change” now in Japanese.
All focus on CO2 is “misplaced”
The Japanese daily also says Mr. Morano’s book shows how scientists from the UK and New Zealand saying that putting all the focus on CO2 is ” misplaced”.
“…amazed at each chapter”
According to the Sankei Shimbun:
We recommend you take this book because it is easy to read. You’ll be amazed at each chapter. It is full of scientific controversies and scandals over global warming that are not well understood in Japan.”
No consensus
The Sankei Shimbun concludes that Mr. Morano’s book provides “an overall picture of the global warming issue” and that it is an issue which “can be viewed from multiple perspectives.”
Overall it’s a very positive, welcome review for Marc Morano’s “The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change” here in Japan. Recently Morano’s book has climbed near the top of the charts for books under Environment.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLarge regions of the globe have  been cooling or not warming in recent decades according to several new scientific papers.
A new paper shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), sea surface temperatures near southern Chile, and the entire region between 50-70°S have cooled or not warmed since the early 1980s (Collins et al., 2019).
The region was more than 2°C warmer 1000 years ago and today’s temps (12.1°C) are the coldest of the last 2300 years (Collins et al., 2019).
Other new papers indicate the North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between southeast Greenland and Denmark have cooled at a rate of 0.78°C per decade since 2004 (Fröb et al., 2019).
The North Atlantic region (Labrador Sea to Icelandic Basin) hasn’t warmed overall (net) since the 1950s (Buckley et al., 2019), which includes no net warming of winter temperatures in Northern Europe and North America since the 1980s (Chen and Luo, 2019, Gan et al., 2019).
Should it be called “global warming” if it isn’t actually global?

"Donald Trump’s treasury secretary has clashed with Greta Thunberg after responding to the activist’s call for immediate fossil fuel divestment by telling the 17-year-old to go to college and study economics. In an attempt to slap down the climate emergency movement, Steven Mnuchin pretended not to know who Thunberg was, before dismissing her concerns as ill-informed. Asked whether calls for public and private-sector divestment from fossil fuel companies would threaten US growth, Mnuchin jibed: “Is she the chief economist? Who is she, I’m confused” – before clarifying that he was joking. “After she goes and studies economics in college she can come back and explain that to us,” Mnuchin added, at a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  Thunberg, 17, responded by tweeting a graph from a UN report showing how the world’s remaining carbon budget will be used up by 2027 unless global emissions are curbed. “My gap year ends in August, but it doesn’t take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1,5° carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don’t add up,” she pointed out. My gap year ends in August, but it doesn’t take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1,5° carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don’t add up. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/1virpuOyYG Mnuchin’s comments expose the huge gulf that still exists between climate activists and the White House. Pressed on the climate emergency, Mnuchin insisted that environmental issues are “clearly complicated”. He said: “When I was allowed to drive I had a Tesla. I drove in California. I liked it.  “But nobody focuses on how that electricity is made and what happens to the storage and the environmental issues on all these batteries.” He also claimed the US was showing leadership in tackling emissions – but through its private sector rather than government. President Trump believes in clean air and water, and a clean environment, Mnuchin insisted, but also believes that more attention should be paid to the environmental damage caused by China and India. People who call for divestment should remember there are “significant economic issues, issues with jobs”, he continued. “Many economies are transitioning to more efficient and cleaner energy. That doesn’t have to be all renewables.” Angela Merkel, though, spoke warmly about the work of the new generation of climate activists. “The impatience of our young people is something that we should tap,” the German chancellor said. In a special address to the WEF, Merkel called for more international cooperation to tackle climate change. “I am totally convinced that the price of inaction will be far higher than the price of action,” she declared. Thunberg has used this week’s gathering in Davos to push for radical change on the climate emergency. She called for an immediate exit from fossil fuel investment, an end to subsidies for the industry and a halt to investment in fossil fuel exploration and extraction by companies, banks, institutions and governments. “You might think we’re naive but if you won’t do it, you must explain to your children why you’ve given up on the Paris agreement goals and knowingly created a climate crisis,” she told delegates on Tuesday. Mnuchin’s comments clearly show the White House has yet to heed the call. The US labour secretary, Eugene Scalia, called for a balanced approach. The energy sector has been an important source of jobs and fully divesting from fossil fuels would also harm US pensioners, he said. On Tuesday, Trump told Davos that delegates should be optimistic. “To embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse. They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThough the media like to tell their audience that man-made climate change is leading to more extreme weather, the data don’t support it. In fact, one could easily argue that Japan’s climate is more agreeable today.
By Kirye in Tokyo
and Pierre Gosselin
No trend in long-term annual precipitation
Over the past 100 years, for example, annual precipitation has not trended in an particular direction over the long term, showing rather some cyclical attributes:

Data source: Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). 
If anything, precipitation has been rather steady for the better part of the past 2 decades, and even resembles what was observed about 60 years ago, in the 1950s.
Note how the extremes in precipitation occurred in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the climate talk was about global cooling. But overall, there’s been no trend change in precipitation in Japan.
Typhoons trending downward modestly!
Typhoons forming, and those striking Japan, also show no worsening, as is otherwise often claimed by climate alarmists. What follows is a plot of typhoon landfalls for Japan and typhoons formed, since 1951:
Data: JMA here and here. 
The data suggest the number of typhoons forming and those striking Japan have declined modestly over the past 70 years, which is in line with the trends for global tropical storms. So there’s nothing alarming happening.
Japan sea level rise “no long-term trend”

Also nothing dramatic is happening with regards to Japan and sea level rise. This is the official conclusion of the JMA! Their site states:
A trend of sea level rise has been observed in Japanese coastal areas since the 1980s, but no long-term trend of rise is seen for the period from 1906 to 2018. Variations with 10- to 20-year periods (near-10-year variations) are seen for the period from 1906 to 2018.




 Time-series representation of annual mean sea level values (1906 – 2018) 
 The 1981 – 2010 average is used as the normal. 
Annual sea level anomaly time series (comma-separated value file: 3 KB)
The graph indicates annual mean sea level anomalies for each year averaged among the four tide gauge stations shown in the map on the left below for the period from 1906 to 1959, and among the four regions shown in the map on the right below for the period from 1960 onward. The solid blue line represents the five-year running mean of annual sea level anomalies averaged among the four stations, while the solid red line represents the corresponding value for the four regions. The dashed blue line represents the value at the four stations for the same period shown by the solid red line (from 1960 onward) for reference.”




Japan annual temps steady 80 years, before peculiar 1990 jump
Finally, we look at Japan’s mean annual temperature trend over the past 100 years. Though we see an overall rise – it had remained more or less steady for some 80 years, from 1918 to 1990. But suddenly in 1990, the mean temperature jumped to new plateau.

Data source: JMA. 
Perhaps this may have in part been due to a change over to electronic measurement systems and urban heat island effect, along with station siting. One thing can be ruled out: Any CO2 effect would not act so instantaneously.
Japan’s climate has not really worsened
Overall in terms of weather extremes, cold and storms, things in Japan have not gotten worse. In fact one could easily argue things have tamed just a bit.

"I love Australia. It’s not a thing you hear too often from progressives. Mostly this is because we don’t go in for the pathetic jingo-nationalist, quasi-militaristic “love it or leave it”-style patriotism that John Howard attempted to link with a love of country.  But I do love Australia. I get an absurd amount of irrational pride when I hear of Australians doing well. When I read stories that Indigenous rock art might be among the oldest in the world I get excited and think, yeah suck it, caves of Cantabria! I can still remember where I was when John Aloisi scored the winning penalty against Uruguay (jumping up in my home in Cairns and cutting my hand on the overhead fan), and like all sensible Australians I let out a deep groan whenever I hear someone start yet again an “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie” chant at the tennis. But my love has nothing to do with Australian Day and no, this is not an article about Australia Day. I mean, of course we should change the date. As one who grew up in country South Australia from German ancestors, the English landing in Sydney has never resonated for me as anything more than New South Wales Proclamation Day. Thanks for the holiday and the cricket at Adelaide Oval, but otherwise ... Keep the public holiday – make it the last Monday in January – it is nicely timed to signal an end to the summer holidays. Call it “Summer Day” or some such and then find another day to actually celebrate the nation. Better still, become a republic and make it that day. But I digress. This is not about Australia Day, but climate change. Because I love Australia, and the real question is why don’t conservatives who refuse to do more on climate change love Australia? Because climate change will destroy much of what we love about this country of ours. Much of what makes Australia unique and beloved by those of us lucky enough to live here is linked to the extremes of our land and climate. In my lifetime I have mostly lived in country areas – in South Australia on the Murray River, in Redlynch just north of Cairns, and now in the northern suburbs of the bush capital that is Canberra. So I love our biggest river and the farming areas of wheat, sheep and dairy around my home town to the grapes and fruit in the Riverland where during uni I picked fruit in the summer holidays. Then there are the tropics with Mossman Gorge, the glorious drive from Cairns to Port Douglas, the Great Barrier Reef and the late afternoon rains. And yes, I love the surrounds of Canberra – where I can live near a national park with kangaroos and echidnas and be able to see the snow caps on the Brindabellas in winter and fiery red of the trees in autumn and the blossoms in spring. As anyone who has spent any time overseas knows, there is something about the sky in Australia that is different – that shade of blue so perfectly captured by Tom Roberts in his painting A Break Away!. That gorgeous clear, crisp blue. I must admit I don’t love Dorothea Mackellar’s My Country. I find the poem rather maudlin, but perhaps I am biased because I am sick of hearing climate change-denying politicians recite it as though it is evidence that climate change has not occurred. Because here’s the thing: when she published that poem in 1908, the average annual temperature in Australia was about 2C lower than it is now. And those conservatives who recite the line about “a sunburnt country” ignore that climate change is going to wreak havoc with everything we love – that tenuous balance of droughts and flooding rains, the ability of agriculture to exist on “thirsty paddocks”, our rivers, our wildlife where “orchids deck the treetops”, even the crisp air and “pitiless blue sky”. This summer has shown how precarious our Australian lifestyle is – the bushfires that have not stopped since September; the mix of fires, smoke, dust, hail (and that is just in Canberra in the past fortnight). We are a nation on the extremities, where climate change will affect and strip away what we love much sooner than will occur in Europe and North America. No patriotic Australian can be anything but angry to read stories of a billion or more animals killed in the fires – especially when you realise the koalas on Kangaroo Island are chlamydia-free and are essentially the best protection against their extinction. Our wildlife is so exceptional and precious that the upset in balance that comes from climate change will render some habitats unliveable. To read that the platypus is facing extinction due to human activity exacerbated by climate change should have every patriotic Australian filled with rage. Conservative patriots love to talk up Australia “punching above its weight” on things such as sport or business or war, but they turn to self-hating cowards when it comes to climate change. Yes, Australia “only” accounts for around 1.3% of emissions (of course well above what you would expect given our population), but given the fragility of our ecosystem, any political leaders who profess to love Australia should be energising our diplomatic networks and using every economic and political lever we have to cajole, convince and encourage other nations to act on climate change. We should do this even if it is out of purely selfish reasons of loving our country and wanting it to remain in the same state that has caused that love. If you love Australia, climate change should scare the hell out of you because the reef, our rivers, our wildlife, our fresh air, even, as we have seen since December, our relaxed summer holidays are going to be stripped away from us. Our government has more reason than most others outside of the Pacific Islands to be demanding global action on climate change. Given our wealth we should be leading the way – leading by example rather than leading to ruin as our current government has been at the most recent climate change conferences. What we love about Australia will be taken by climate change well before other nations who emit much more greenhouse gas will feel great changes. And that should enrage us and our representatives, and it should drive their actions. I love Australia and so I want action on climate change. And if you love Australia, so should you. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"

Century-scale cooling can be elicited by volcanism.

"A heatwave over India that started on May 21 and has produced India’s highest recorded temperatures in two decades has claimed more than 2,000 lives and caused widespread devastation. It would be easy to dismiss this as a freak event, something so far out of the norm that there’s little chance of preparing for it. But this isn’t quite true. Even the most extreme events can be predicted – and prepared for. I specialise in a statistical approach called extreme value theory which draws inferences about very rare events. Among other uses, it can be used to estimate the probability of a heatwave occurring.  Where most statistical methods are great at modelling average values – what temperature is it likely to be next week? – they tend to be poor at modelling the extremes (what is the highest temperature we’ll see this decade?). Our model instead focuses on extreme values themselves, in this case the hottest days of the year, which are the values that can cause the greatest devastation. This also means we can figure out the rough probability of events larger and longer than any that have gone before. Just because we haven’t seen consecutive 40℃ days in the UK, or snow in the middle of the Sahara, doesn’t mean it can’t happen. Extreme value theory helps assess these probabilities.  We can use it to assess how likely the current heatwave is by analysing daily temperature maximums for Delhi over the years 1972-2013. Extreme value models can be used to estimate the temperature expected to be attained on average once a year (called the one-year return level). In Delhi the one-year return level is 45℃. However, single hot days do not have a great impact on excess mortality. Consecutive runs of hot days are more dangerous since the human body is subjected to heat stress over many days without being given the chance to recover. Fortunately the same type of extreme value models can be used to estimate the probability of runs of consecutive days above a certain temperature.  During the current heatwave Delhi recorded seven consecutive days above 44℃. That’s an entire week above an exceptionally high temperature – such an event is expected to happen on average once every 30 years. However, care must be taken with such results since they are often subject to large uncertainty as they are based upon very few rare events in the observational record. An El Niño may make such heatwaves more likely. The El Niño is one of two opposing phases in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a large-scale fluctuation of sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific. Right now a large El Niño (warmer waters) is currently building and will peak later this year. This generally means higher temperatures in India. Could the current ENSO be contributing to the current heatwave event? Under current conditions, the probability of observing seven days above 44℃ in Delhi is slightly increased, with the event expected to happen on average once in every 25 years. But it is difficult to definitively say that El Niño is having an effect since this result is again subject to a great deal of uncertainty. One important question for decision makers concerns whether heatwaves are going to become more likely under climate change. Answering this question becomes difficult since there are numerous sources of uncertainty – most obviously, we don’t even know exactly what “climate change” will entail. For example, different scenarios are generated, most famously by the IPCC, that aim to predict how future emissions will evolve. For each particular scenario, different climate research centres run different models that produce different replications of each future scenario.  The most common way to account for uncertainty is to take an ensemble of many different climate models – yet even this can leave a big margin for error, especially when analysing rare events such as heatwaves. In 2003 a month-long heatwave struck Europe, causing at least 20,000 deaths and possibly as many as 70,000. My colleagues and I have previously analysed this particularly hot summer to assess the effect of climate change on heatwaves. We wanted to understand whether such an event would become more likely under future climate change and whether the behaviour of heatwave events would change.  We found that generally temperatures would increase, an increase of 1℃ in global temperatures would lead to an increase of, at most, 2.6℃ in the one-year return level at Orleans in central France. However, despite the fact heatwaves like in 2003 are expected to become more likely, it is not expected that such events will tend to last longer. Statistical approaches have great potential to help decision makers mitigate for devastating events such as the current Indian heatwave. By providing reliable estimates of how often they will occur better preparation measures can be undertaken which will reduce the number of deaths.  Looking to the future, the effect of climate change is the largest uncertainty. Further collaborative research between statisticians and climate scientists presents the best chance to understand the potentially devastating effects that climate change will have on all types of extreme event."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThat’s right, last week a panel, made up of 4 pompous linguists and one journalist, chose “climate hysteria” as Germany’s taboo word (un-word) of 2019.

Image: PatriotRetort.com
Discriminatory, disguising or misleading
The Unwort des Jahres (un-word of the year) is a new or recently popularized term used in Germany which a panel deems “violates human rights or infringes upon Democratic principles”.
According to Wikipedia, “The term may be one that discriminates against societal groups or may be euphemistic, disguising or misleading. The term is usually, but not always, a German term. The term is chosen from suggestions sent in by the public.”
Over the years, like so many other institutions, the volunteer panel has leaned to the left and has been choosing words that tend to cast conservatives and the right political spectra in a negative light. The panel’s announcement of the un-word of the year gets broad media coverage.
Last week the panel selected “climate hysteria” as the un-word of the year.
Taboo because it “defames climate protection efforts”

According to Wikipedia, the panel – which has no scientific expert on it at all, chose “climate (change) hysteria” as the un-word of 2019 because it “defames climate protection efforts and the climate protection movement, and discredits important discussions about climate protection.”
Climate science dissent is no longer welcome, the panel wants to tell us.
According to Wikipedia:
The expression [climate hysteria] was used by many in politics, economics, and the media in 2019 – by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung as well as by entrepreneurs and especially by politicians of the Alternative for Germany party. It dismisses the increased commitment to climate protection as some kind of collective psychosis. Moreover, in light of scientific findings regarding climate change, this word is misleading and irresponsibly supports anti-scientific tendencies.”
Yet, thankfully, some media have grown critical of the panel of volunteer linguists and single journalist, and all the media attention it gets. For example, Bild newspaper wrote:
As if it were the decision of an important institution, the decision of a privately organised group is reported: Four linguists and a journalist who volunteer once a year to play linguistic police. According to the motto: Listen up, citizens, the language committee has decided, this word is taboo from now on!
Ironically, in 2011 the panel chose “alternativlos” (no alternative) as the un-word of 2010 in politics because they claimed it was “undemocratic”, as any discussion on a subject “would be deemed unnecessary or undesirable”.
Today the panel appears to have forgotten about that earlier choice.
In any case, skeptics and dissenters should instead ramp up the use of the term “climate hysteria” to describe the FFF and XR movements, and all the nutty doomsday scientists who like telling us there’s no alternative to decarbonization.

Have you ever wanted a reliable way to test your Internet connection speed? I have, and there’s been a bunch of tests devised…but not all work that well. I even saw one once where after the test a picture of Al Gore would pop up and say “I invented the Internet and your speed on the information superhighway is: xxxx bytes/second.”
This test http://www.speedtest.net/ is one of the coolest looking and most accurate ones I’ve ever seen. It figures out where you are in the world and provides test points to servers all over the globe. It does an accurate download and upload speed test by doing a file transfer to/from your PC. and displays it in a nice dashboard representation as shown below.

"The death of famed “daredevil” climber and base jumper Dean Potter has once again raised the idea that all high-risk sportspeople are hedonistic thrill seekers. Our research into extreme athletes shows this view is simplistic and wrong. It’s about attitudes to risk. In his famous Moon speech in 1962, John F Kennedy said: Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked [by a New York Times journalist] why did he want to climb it. He said, ‘Because it is there.’ Well, space is there, and we’re going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there … Humans have evolved through taking risks. In fact, most human actions can be conceptualised as containing an element of risk: as we take our first step, we risk falling down; as we try a new food, we risk being disgusted; as we ride a bicycle, we risk falling over; as we go on a date, we risk being rejected; and as we travel to the moon, we risk not coming back. Human endeavour and risk are intertwined. So it is not surprising that despite the increasingly risk-averse society that we live in, many people crave danger and risk – a life less sanitised.  Dean Potter exemplified that craving. He was a pioneering climber and base jumper, well known for scaling huge vertical rock faces without ropes and with only a parachute for protection. On May 16 Potter and fellow climber Graham Hunt died in Yosemite National Park after attempting a dangerous wingsuit flight, where base jumpers wear a special suit that enables them to “fly” forwards and control their fall. Potter’s endeavours and those of George Mallory seem motivated by something very different from hedonistic thrill. Over the past ten years we have interviewed dozens of high-risk sports people and studied their profiles in detail with a view to trying to find out what that “something different” is. Our findings are surprising. For example, it is now clear that sensation-seeking explains very little about the motive for many of these people. Many high-risk sportspeople do not crave excitement at all – yes they seek out risky environments, but only with a view to minimising any additional risk so that they can remain in control despite the apparent danger of dangling off cliffs or jumping out of planes. But there are two more striking features of our recent risk-taking research. The first is something we call “agentic emotion regulation”. Feeling agency is similar to feeling in control, but more akin to the feeling “I want to be the person who decides how my life pans out”. Some high-risk sportspeople purposefully seek out danger in order to make some sense of their feelings of lack of agency. In other words, in everyday life they do not feel like the chess player of their life but more like the pawn on the chessboard – they feel emotionally constrained and passive.  Legendary climber Patrick Berhault, who later died traversing a steep face of Switzerland’s highest mountain without a safety rope, once said he didn’t think he’d do it if there wasn’t the notion of risk. “Ordinary life lacks intensity and attraction for me”, he said, “I can’t stand it; I believe we should live!” The fascinating feature of this finding is that the lowest sense of agency is in relationships that are the most emotional: with loving partners. This feeling of low agency is made worse by the difficulty with expressing their emotions. In this way, the relationship with risk serves as a proxy for the relationship with a loving partner, except that the risk-taker is rewarded – rather than penalised – for not expressing emotion. The primary emotion to overcome in risk-taking activities is fear. If a person has difficulty experiencing and expressing emotions then the risk-taking arena becomes a rewarding place.  It is rewarding because they have moved from a feeling of inadequacy, “why can’t you tell me how you feel??” to a sense of achievement, “wow, that was amazing how you achieved that scary feat … ” In this way, the relationship with nature is more rewarding than their relationship with other humans. My vision turns black and white except for the searing red line. 
Sounds fade. I feel faint, face flushed with heat. My muscles tense, but I hold calmness in my centre and loosen my arms from the shoulders to my fingertips. The moment sickens me, and my mind tries to stop it, but I command myself to walk. – Dean Potter on facing fear and going ropeless. The second surprising thing we found in our research is that the difficulty with emotions leads people to take greater risks and to have more accidents in the high-risk environment – where accidents have serious consequences. The link between emotional expression and accidents is our most recent finding and one that was so intriguing that we ran three different studies on various high-risk sports to see if we found the same thing. Each time, we found a strong link between the difficulty in expressing emotions and the chances of being in an accident. We now understand this link. People who have difficulty identifying and describing their emotions seek risky extreme sports because they provide the experience of a more easily identifiable emotion: fear, perhaps the purest emotion of them all.  The continued search for fear (and overcoming that fear) leads people to take further risks, which in turn eventually leads to a greater likelihood of an accident. This finding was novel because the established view in emotion research is that people do not typically repeatedly approach situations that induce fear. However, extreme sportsmen and women are attracted to risk because it provides an opportunity to experience the negative emotion of fear and to turn that fear into a fantastically rewarding and positive experience (often in retrospect). Extreme sportspeople learn something about themselves by taking risks and by embracing the full spectrum of their emotions. It is a construction of the self that is played out in nature with all its inherent dangers.  They expect more from life. A craving for life in its purest, simplest, and sharpest form. Life in direct juxtaposition to death; to live fully or to die trying. In that respect, adventurers such as Dean Potter can teach us all how to embrace life and to turn directly to face our fears."

The image above is from Google Earth, which had its photography for Chico updated just within the last two weeks. The picture is the closest zoom available and shows the new City Plaza under construction. Based on other construction landmarks around town and the colors of foliage, plus the fullness of Lake Oroville at the time, I’m estimating the image was snapped by satellite sometime in late June 2006.

Just looking at it I immediately found out something I didn’t know; That the four corners of City Plaza are compass points. The North corner, which points to Duffy’s Tavern is almost exactly true North, with the other corners being East, South and West. I added the letters to the image for your convenience, they don’t exist on the sidewalks.
The previous imagery for Chico on Google Earth was taken in 2003, and quite fuzzy. Partially due to the image being taken while smoke and haze from a wildfire somewhere covered the town. Part of that imagery remains in the Nord Avenue section on the west side and when you load images with that view, you can see a sharp cutoff where the smoke ends and fresh image begins.
Another thing thats been updated is integration of vegetation colors at lesser zoom levels, which clearly show where agriculture exists. See the image below.

But the coolest thing is the 3D capability, and in the image below, you can take in all of Chico and the foothills in one image. This view is looking Northeast from about 23,000 feet altitude. The Chico Airport is in the upper left. Click the link below the picture for a larger more detailed image.

If you haven’t tried Google Earth yet, its really a lot of fun. Free too. See http://earth.google.com/ It’s a great tool for figuring out things or for just looking around at things you’ve never seen from the air. The Pro version, which I use, allows integration of overlays and drawings, and allows measurements. When I was running for County Supervisor this past year I used Google Earth partly to devise a solution to the Keefer Slough flooding problem. I’ll post that solution in a future blog.
Another thing that can be seen in Google Earth is the city owned stormwater basin just south of the Chico ER building that was the subject of problems this summer related to mosquitos and a West Nile virus outbreak. That was a hot topic on Jack Lee’s blog this summer.
But the most odd new image in Chico is the one below. Can anybody guess what it is?

"If you’ve ever eaten fish from the sea, especially an older or larger fish, you’ve probably been exposed to the pollutant mercury. It’s invisible, odourless, and dangerous. When ingested by humans, mercury is a neurotoxin, attacking the brain and nervous system, and the development of babies and infants can be particularly hampered.  Whereas most of us are at liberty to adapt our diets, people living in the Arctic strictly rely on marine wildlife for food and, unfortunately, mercury levels in animals such as seals, beluga whales and polar bears are among the highest worldwide. It’s harming birds too – recent research shows that endangered ivory gulls have 50 times more mercury in their feathers than when records began 130 years ago. The stuff we’re really concerned about is methylmercury, the most toxic form of the element that accumulates in those animals. And there’s a mystery here – while emissions from factories and power plants have pumped a lot of mercury into the Arctic, we still know little about exactly how this is converted to methylmercury.  One idea is that methylmercury is produced in the oceans. Inorganic mercury, natural or man-made, sticks to algae in the surface waters. When these algae sink to the deep ocean, microbes are already waiting to eat them. We believe some of these microbes can convert the inorganic mercury to methylmercury.  Methylmercury is then passed along the food chain via a process known as bioaccumulation. Algae pick it up from the water, are eaten by zooplankton (krill) which are eaten by smaller fish, which in turn are eaten by bigger fish – at each step, methylmercury gets many times more concentrated, reaching dangerous levels in top predators such as seals, polar bears or even humans. But where does all this mercury come from? Mercury is unique – it is the only heavy metal that is present as gas in the atmosphere, where it stays on for an average of about a year. As a consequence, it can travel across the globe, including to the remote Arctic. One theory is that the Arctic is a global sink for increased man-made mercury emissions from North America, Europe and now Asia, and possibly causing the high mercury levels in arctic animals. However long-term data on mercury levels in Arctic animals don’t always match up with increasing man-made emissions. Other factors must be at play.  Though scientists have generally focused on atmospheric mercury sources over the past decade, models suggest that atmospheric emissions can’t account for all the mercury. A large source of mercury to the Arctic Ocean is missing.  Rivers could provide such a source, especially during spring flood of Siberian rivers. While this finding is exciting, Siberian rivers and the Arctic Ocean itself remain under-sampled. We actually have to go to Siberia during the spring floods and measure mercury to know what is coming out of the rivers, and how far it travels into the sea.  That’s why we are now investigating the mercury discharge, especially during the spring flood, of one of the largest Siberian rivers, the Yenisei. We must find out where, how and what is turning inorganic mercury – natural or man-made, from the atmosphere or from rivers – into its most toxic and bioaccumulating form, methylmercury. We already know that inorganic mercury in the oceans has increased because of man-made emissions. At the same time a warming climate and melting sea ice is likely to play havoc with Artic algae and methylating microbes. But what will this mean in the future? A previous Polarstern cruise in 2011 gave us some first insights. In research published in the journal Scientific Reports my colleagues and I presented the first full-depth high resolution profiles (> 5 km-depth) of total mercury and methylmercury in the central Arctic Ocean (79-90°N).  Our findings suggested methylmercury production in the Arctic Ocean is highest in the area of thinner and younger sea ice, probably due to a higher accumulation of algae in these areas. Methylmercury concentrations peak shallower than in the other oceans (150 m in the Arctic versus roughly 1000 m in the Atlantic). The shallow methylmercury production, close to the surface where algae thrive, likely results in enhanced biological uptake at the base of the arctic food chain. While these first few results might hint an alternative explanation for the high methylmercury levels of Arctic wildlife, many questions remain open. That’s why this summer I’ll spend two months investigating mercury changes in the Arctic while on board the German icebreaker Polarstern sailing to North Pole. Polarstern will be joined by research ships from the US and Canada – the operation, organised within the international program GEOTRACES, will be the largest exploration of mercury (and other elements) in the Arctic Ocean.  This effort involves many different research teams and will take a whole lot of coordination. At sea we also need to keep each other up to date about what we’re doing. To master these efforts the mercury teams on the three research ships connect online and will be keeping each other and the interested public informed on ResearchGate, a professional network for scientists. The three mercury teams will map mercury and methylmercury distributions throughout the Arctic Ocean, and merge their data. This is critical to understand marine methylmercury production and to predict the impact of ongoing climate changes on the Arctic mercury cycle. After all, global warming is bad enough as it is, without contaminated fish to worry about, too."
"Hedgehogs have acquired a surprisingly cuddly reputation for a nocturnal predator festooned with spines and fleas. Perhaps it is their habit of curling up, their classic cute faces with turned up noses, or their bumbling manner. While foxes are cunning, hares are mad and weasels are weaselly the hedgehog is not at all threatening, but instead they are portrayed as either a stout yeoman of olde England or, if female, a maternal Mrs Tiggy-Winkle.  All of this makes hedgehogs the ideal icon for wildlife hospitals such as St Tiggywinkles or road safety adverts. My memories of 1970s hedgehogs are not so much of the stout, aproned Mrs Tiggywinkle but what appeared to be a nightly suburban back garden lawn swingers party. Hedgehogs were routine visitors to our small 1960s housing estate garden, their noisy romantic trysts dismissed as “oh its just the hedgehogs at it again”. The prospect that hedgehogs would now warrant specific conservation action would have seemed far fetched. Judging by the noise they seemed determined to conserve themselves with gusto.  Times have changed. In 2014 hedgehogs joined the list of UK Biodiversity Action Plan species, under their more official name of the Western European Hedgehog, and, more informally, 2015 sees the launch of the first Hedgehog Improvement Area in the Birmingham suburb of Solihull. Hedgehog numbers in the 1950s were put at more than 35 million, but contemporary surveys suggest that there may not be even one million. On the BBC’s Springwatch series, hedgehogs now star not as a familiar creature we can all see but as one of the endangered, heading towards extinction. Most species declines are complicated and the hedgehog’s is no exception. The animals have lost countryside habitat as the fine grain of small fields, woods and old hedgerows was industrialised, and in cities their garden homes have been tided, paved and surrounded by impenetrable fences. Perhaps we can also point to climate change, declining prey populations and predation by badgers. In addition hedgehogs are notoriously vulnerable as they cross the road – hence their resonance for road safety campaigns.  Hedgehogs would do well to heed the advice of their animated road safety avatars and a recent study of a remnant population in Regent’s Park in London suggest that they might be doing just that. The park staff, working with The Royal Zoological Society of London, have been tracking their hedgehogs’ nightly movements using radio and GPS trackers. The results show the hedgehogs avoid crossing the surrounding roads and don’t stray beyond the safety of the park. All living creatures would do well to avoid city roads. It is not hard to see the rapid selective advantage of not crossing. Oddly, road kills can be evidence of improving circumstances as revealed by hedgehogs in the Republic of Ireland. You may have been perturbed by the earlier mention of badgers as a threat to hedgehogs, after all badgers are meant to be brave and noble. They are also indifferent to a hedgehog’s spines and chomp through them.  In Ireland badgers have been subject to a cull to try and limit the transmission of bovine TB. In areas where badger numbers have been culled the numbers of hedgehog road traffic victims has increased compared to control regions with no badger reduction. Similar results are coming through from the UK’s own badger cull. In the UK the 1990s saw marked increases in otter road casualties as they recolonised much of England and beavers may be next as their populations expand. Road kill may not be the ideal methodology but can be a useful and effective bell weather of change. The hedgehog’s fate is not the only recent decline of a once familiar creature. Just look at house sparrows, starlings or wall brown butterflies – all of these creatures were once so commonplace you’d not give them a second glance, and all are now in trouble. From a species point of view it pays to be rare. We are not bad at the last ditch, highly expensive defence or reintroduction of white tailed sea eagles and large blue butterflies. Meantime the hedgehog’s supporters are rallying. This year will see the first “Day of the Hedgehog”, a follow up to a national hedgehog survey. If only they hadn’t made the event sound like a 1970s low-budget horror movie. Or maybe they know something about those back garden noises best left unsaid."

Dry summers as a doomsday scenario – are they really something new?
By Axel Robert Göhring
(Text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
Drought completely normal during High Medieval Ages.
Researchers from the German Department of Ecology and Ecosystem Dynamics at the University of Greifswald have shown that drought in the High Middle Ages was completely normal during the summer. Even if hardly any real scientist dares to say anything against the climate madness, many do their work properly and deliver many small mosaic pieces for dismantling all the fraud.
Last spring, however, one could hear “top physicist” Harald Lesch at the Markus Lanz’s ZDF show claim how climate change would hit quite badly in summer, how the drought of the “record summer” 2019 would have violent effects, especially on the holy German Forest (forest die-off scare came knocking again…).
So what about drought in the holy German Forest 2019? Is it real, or “interpreted”?
Well, it’s probably real. But why not? In summer it is hot and dry even in the temperate climate zone of Europe. Mr. Lesch & Co. showed a heat peak and claimed it is man-made climate change. And when a cold peak appears, then it is only weather – or even proof of climate change. Weather extremes are somehow more frequent today.
Dry summers in Europe not uncommon, new study

Biologist Martin Wilmking and his team from the University of Greifswald in the German state of Vorpommern now have shown that dry summers a thousand years ago were not uncommon in northern Germany. In fact, they were much warmer than today – and this without combustion engines, industry and motor traffic.
Prof. Wilmking and his biologists evaluated so-called proxy data, i.e. verifiable effects of climate in animate or inanimate nature. Specifically, the team worked on annual rings in living beech trees and thousand-year-old archaeological timber: the long established field of expertise is dendroclimatology (Greek: dendron – the tree).
Trees growing faster today
The authors prove once again that our forests are growing much faster today than in the past, because agriculture (also traffic & industry) provides them with a lot of fixed nitrogen (ammonium salts).
The modestly increased CO2 content of today’s air also allows the trees to open the stomata of the leaves for a shorter period of time, thus limiting water losses. In other words, our industrial civilization is considerably HELPING the forest by supplying it with building materials and  even water indirectly. This is nothing new for avid EIKE readers, as we have pointed out more than once that the planet has become much greener in recent decades.
Often dry in the prosperous High Middle Ages
If one includes the faster growth of today’s trees, one can conclude in comparison using the annual ring curves of the historical woods that it was often dry in summer in the High Middle Ages. Even the Rhine, the largest river in Europe, became dry near Cologne. Yet the High and Late Middle Ages were not a phase of decline like the Early Middle Ages. On the contrary, the courtly knightly culture flourished in Western and Central Europe. There are tens of thousands of stone castles in Germany, Switzerland, Bohemia and Austria – several in the Saale valley near EIKE’s home city of Jena.
And if you take a boat trip on the Rhine or Moselle rivers – ruins of stone castles can be seen everywhere. They all date back to the time after 1000 AD. The stone castles are a testimony to a significant increase in Europe’s economic performance, which can be traced back to the warmth of the Climate Optimum. The development lasted until the late Middle Ages, when it then became much colder again.
Politically correct theories assume that the booming economy overtaxed nature and thus undermined itself. Certainly not wrong, but without the cold, nature could have recovered faster from the overexploitation.
Warmer is better
Also findings from graves, for example near Berlin, prove that Brandenburg citizens from the Renaissance period were significantly sicker than their ancestors of the High and Late Middle Ages. The saying rings true: “Cold is bad, warm is good.”

The California legislature may want to revisit the wording of their proposed ban on incandescents (AB 722). California assemblyman LLoyd Levine, a Democrat from Van Nuys in Los Angeles, wants to make California the first to ban incandescent light bulbs (by 2012) part of its new initiatives to reduce energy use and greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. But somebody hasn’t thought this through completely.
Why do I suggest a change? Two reasons: 1- There’s a new efficient challenger to the old tungsten filament light bulb. 2- The Compact Flourescent Lamps touted as “Eco Bulbs” have a small amount of mercury an other heavy metals in them, making disposal a problem. Some landfills won’t take them!
GE has announced an advancement in incandescent technology that promises to increase the efficiency of lightbulbs to put them on par with compact fluorescent lamps (CFL).

The new high efficiency incandescent (HEI(TM)) lamp, which incorporates innovative new materials being developed in partnership by GE’s Lighting division, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, and GE’s Global Research Center, headquartered in Niskayuna, NY, would replace traditional 40- to 100-Watt household incandescent light bulbs, the most popular lamp type used by consumers today.
The new technology could be expanded to all other incandescent types as well. The target for these bulbs at initial production is to be nearly twice as efficient, at 30 lumens-per-Watt, as current incandescent bulbs. Ultimately the high efficiency lamp (HEI) technology is expected to be about four times as efficient as current incandescent bulbs and comparable to CFL bulbs. Adoption of new technology could lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions of up to 40 million tons of CO2 in the U.S. and up to 50 million tons in the Eeropean Union if the entire installed base of traditional incandescent bulbs was replaced with HEI lamps.
So take note California assemblymen and assemblywomen, how about mandating a level of lighting efficiency for bulbs rather than assuming that innovation of older technology can’t happen?

"Pesticides are intended to be harmful. They kill pests, diseases and weeds. But some also harm humans and wildlife. Pesticides are a huge global business, worth around US$45 billion. Each year, 3.5 billion kilogrammes of pesticides are applied to food crops and their use is growing. Much use of this use is at best ineffective and at worst outright harmful.  In recent research we showed that farmers in Asia and Africa have been able to cut the use of pesticides while boosting crop yields, reducing costs and delivering  healthier profits. Even the landscape surrounding the farms benefits. Each kilogramme of pesticide used in agriculture imposes €3-15 (US$4-19) of external economic costs on the environment, wildlife and human health – money spent by water companies to remove them from drinking water, for instance, or the loss of valuable pollinating insects. Any reduction in use, therefore, saves farmers costs, but also benefits the wider economy too. Cutting out pesticides can be a no-brainer. All pests have some natural predators and parasites and for farmers these are often free. Farmers can build their use into farm management and minimise or even replace synthetic pesticides. This is known as integrated pest management (IPM), an approach focused on manipulating the crop ecosystem rather than simply wiping pests out.  Through these farming strategies crop yields can be increased while reducing pesticide application and costs. Farmers get more and the environment wins too. Other research is increasingly showing that sustainable approaches in agriculture can both increase yields and improve the environment – whether the focus is management of soils, water, trees or livestock. In our research, we analysed 85 IPM projects from 24 countries in Asia and Africa that were implemented over the past 20 years. We wanted to assess their productivity and reliance on pesticides.  Across all the projects we found yields were up by an average of 41% over periods of 1-5 years after project implementation, while pesticide use went down by 69%. This goes against the conventional assumption which states that pesticide use and yields are positively correlated – as one goes up, so does the other. Our results show otherwise. Most cases we assessed fell firmly into the top-left section of the below graph where pesticide use falls and yields increase. The most significant innovation has been the deployment of farmer field schools (FFS) to spread IPM. These outdoor schools, which are run on principles of ecological education and learning through experience, don’t just teach farmers about new technology. They also boost ecological knowledge, problem-solving skills and teach farmers how to use their political strength. FFSs have been set up in 90 countries and there are huge numbers of graduates: 650,000 in Bangladesh, 930,000 in Vietnam and 1.5m in Indonesia. Some 20,000 FFS graduates worldwide are now running schools for other farmers, having graduated from farmer to expert trainer. Across the 24 countries and 85 projects we assessed, various different methods were employed to achieve these results. In the irrigated rice fields of Vietnam’s Mekong Delta, predatory beetles are excellent pest-controllers, but are killed when sprayed. Research showed insecticide applications in the first 40 days of rice planting were counter-productive. Two million farmers therefore adopted a “no early spray” rule, which saved money and reduced pesticide use by more than half. The melon fly is one of Bangladesh’s biggest pests. Rather than just spray the watermelon fields, simple pheromone traps were created using a male-scented lure in a recycled plastic jar or bottle with a small amount of insecticide. The results were spectacular: yields have risen 40-130% within 2 years, while insecticide use fell from 15 sprays per season to zero, meaning a healthy boost in profits. Clever behavioural manipulation can also make some cropped areas unattractive to pests. In Kenya, the push-pull system design – vutu sukumu – means farmers mix maize with legumes and plant grass varieties on field borders. The maize pests are pushed away by natural chemicals released by the legumes, while their predators are pulled in by the natural chemicals produced by the grass borders. As it happens, the mix also suppresses the invasive and parasitic Striga, better known as witchweed. Despite the evidence, many still believe IPM to be too complex for farmers to understand – and explicit national policy support has been relatively rare. In the past 20 years, the only countries that have seen significant falls in pesticide use are 
the UK (down 44%), France (down 38%), Japan (down 32%), and Vietnam (down 24%).   Some pesticide manufacturers have even appropriated the FFS model to promote greater use of their products. There are good reasons for such push-back: in some countries local markets for pesticides have collapsed, such as in East Java in Indonesia.   IPM has remarkable potential but the job is never done, so investment in research and development must continue in the long term. Ecological and economic conditions change; climates change too. Pests, diseases and weeds evolve, new pests and diseases emerge (often because of pesticide overuse) and pests and diseases are easily transported or are carried to new locations, often where natural enemies do not exist.  In just the past few years we have seen the emergence of the banana leaf roller in India and Nepal, the invasive cassava mealybug in south-east Asia, cucumber mosaic virus in Bangladesh, tomato yellow leaf curl virus in West Africa and cassava mosaic virus and brown streak virus in Uganda. Each requires rapid and co-ordinated action. But working with nature’s services – rather than against them – offers new routes to success. We have shown that millions of small farmers across Asia and Africa using IPM packages can deliver substantial reductions in pesticide use coupled with increased yields. Reduced reliance on synthetic pesticides delivers a range of on and off-farm benefits, including savings, improved public health and improved natural capital on and around farms. Yet, IPM, like other forms of sustainable intensification of agriculture, is much more than just a set of technologies. It is knowledge-intensive, builds social capital and so contributes to society too."
"Proposed changes to building regulations in England are likely to make buildings less energy efficient not more, a group of leading architects and engineers has warned.In a damning assessment of proposals to reform Part L of the Building Regulations, which sets the minimum energy performance standards for new dwellings, a growing coalition of professionals has described the changes as “a step backwards, in a climate where we need a huge leap forward”.“The proposals are framed as an improvement, but they actually represent a reduction in the energy performance standards of buildings,” says Clara Bagenal George, a building services engineer at Elementa Consulting and founder of the London Energy Transformation Initiative (Leti), a voluntary group of more than 1,000 architects and engineers that has been calling for radical changes to how building energy consumption is assessed.Under current regulations, all new building designs are assessed against a “notional” benchmark design, using parameters such as the thermal performance of materials, the orientation and size of the windows, airtightness and heating and ventilation systems (pdf). The proposed building must meet the performance of the notional design to pass the test. Critically, the new changes to the regulations would remove something called the Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard, meaning a building designed next year could be allowed to perform much worse than one built in 2013, when the current standards were introduced. Similarly, a building that would fail to meet the current regulations would pass under the new system. Part L applies to all buildings, although the current consultation covers only dwellings.Secondly, Leti warns that a proposed emphasis on overall carbon footprint will help to mask the actual energy performance of new homes. The government intends to introduce a new factor into the assessment, related to the energy efficiency of the grid, not the building itself. Because the National Grid has been rapidly decarbonising over the last few years, as more renewables have been connected, the new method of assessment would show that a home produced lower carbon emissions than before – despite the design being exactly the same.“The new proposals totally mask the actual energy efficiency of a home,” says Clare Murray, head of sustainability at architecture firm Levitt Bernstein and member of Leti. “They make the building look like it is performing better, when the reality is it could be much worse.”  At a time when the built environment accounts for 40% of UK carbon emissions, a growing number of architects, engineers, planners and developers are demanding urgent change to the regulations to insist on more stringent energy standards. The proposed reforms of Part L are a missed opportunity to properly address the climate emergency, they say.“It’s a massive disappointment,” says Joe Giddings, co-founder of the Architects Climate Action Network (Acan), a campaign group formed last year to address the twin crises of climate and ecological breakdown. “From disregarding the performance of a building’s fabric to ignoring the embodied energy of materials, the proposals represent a total loosening of regulations. And it’s all hidden in a dense consultation document that seems designed to confuse.”Both Leti and Acan have also criticised proposals to remove local authorities’ existing powers to insist on greater energy efficiency than the national building regulations demand. Around 65% of local authorities have declared a climate emergency, and many have already introduced more stringent energy standards into the planning process, but all this would be overwritten by the new lower national regulations.“Not only are the building regulations going backwards,” says Murray, “but local authorities won’t be able to set their own rules appropriate to their areas. It will roll the whole country backwards.”Leti wants to see a fundamental shift towards monitoring how buildings actually perform in use, away from the current system of simply measuring abstract design factors in a vacuum, before the dwelling is built. Their research has shown that many buildings don’t come anywhere near meeting their purported Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) band, the official rating of a property’s energy efficiency. Equally, the way the rating system calculates heat loss and gain means it can’t detect factors such as more insulation and better airtightness, so good buildings end up being rated lower than they should be.“The current system is simply not fit for purpose,” says Bagenal George. “It’s the wrong set of tools, as it was never designed to achieve net zero carbon.” The UK has a legal commitment to achieve net zero carbon by 2050, but Leti believes the new building regulations will knock it hopelessly off course. It is urging people to respond to the consultation on Part L by the 7 February deadline. On Monday, it will launch its own 150-page Climate Emergency Design Guide, along with an equally hefty Embodied Carbon Primer, which it hopes will provide practical solutions for architects, clients and local authorities to achieve a zero-carbon future.“At the moment, our regulations simply aim for a ‘percentage better than bad’,” says Bagenal George. “We want to redefine what ‘good’ looks like and set out how we can get there.” • This article was amended on 27 January 2020. An earlier version said the proposed changes to building regulations applied to “England and Wales”. Housing is a devolved matter and the Welsh government has launched similar, but separate, proposals."

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot long ago one (right wing) politician warned before the German Parliament that the bicycle as a means of transport was extremely dangerous – especially for children – and thus ought not be promoted.
“Highly impractical and dangerous”
This of course brought ridicule from the infallible leftists and greens – and yes, even from German centrists who have long become all drugged up on green and “climate protection”.

AfD parliamentarian Dr. Dirk Spaniel told before the Parliament: “Soberly considered, bicycles are highly impractical and dangerous.”
According to Spaniel, a transportation expert, a child transported on a bicycle is exposed to greater danger than in a car. On the Green Party’s vision of a bicycle utopia in Germany and the world, Spaniel mocked: “They want to draw an ideal fairy tale world here with bicycles, which do not exist in this form.”
Twice as likely to die on a bike
As much as the left and greens like to ridicule Dr. Spaniel’s claim, it is backed up by most studies.

For example, the Washington Post here writes that “bikes are the most dangerous way to get around with the exception of motorcycles” and that in the USA, “you’re more than twice as likely to die while riding a bike than riding in a car, per trip” and riding a bicycle is “about 500 times more fatal than riding in a bus”. Here the WaPo cited according a 2007 study led by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention epidemiologist Laurie Beck.
Why so many German politicians are now striving to transport children using such a dangerous mode of transport remains a mystery. It’s one of the side effects of being drugged on green. In their doped minds, addicts dismiss all the risks and amplify the promised benefits.
Bicycle deaths rising in Germany
As bike riding increases in Germany, so do the accidents and fatalities. According to Spiegel, citing the Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden: “445 people died in accidents on a bicycle – 63 cyclists more than in the previous year and the highest number since 2009.”
“A total of 88,850 cyclists were involved in accidents on German roads in 2018,” Spiegel wrote earlier in 2019.  “That is around 11 percent more than in the previous year.”
25 times higher risk of injury
According to AfD Parliamentarian Dr. Dirk Spaniel: “Parents who transport their children on bicycles increase the risk of injury to them 25 times more than those who transport them by car.”
Time for parents to be responsible for their kids and to stop pretending they can be responsible for the climate.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUsually shunned by the German mainstream media, today moderate, rational voices on the issue of climate change are beginning to be heard on the air waves once again. This may be temporary. We’ll just have to wait and see.

Leading German climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt. Image: Die kalte Sonne
For example, just days ago, leading climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt was interviewed by NDR German public radio’s Anke Harnack on the topic of climate change. As protests by yellow vests in France and angry farmers in the Netherlands intensify, perhaps the establishment in Germany is having second thoughts about going down the hysterical climate rescue path that has been forcefully advocated in Germany over the recent months.
Prosperity based on “reliable energy supplies”
In the interview Vahrenholt, a leading founder of Germany’s modern environmental movement, tells the NDR that following the demands made by Greta Thunberg would put global prosperity at risk and exacerbate world hunger. He says the amazing improvement human society has seen over the last 100 years is thanks to “reliable energy supplies”.
“Huge, huge difficulties”
“Shutting these down in 12 years would indeed throw us into huge, huge difficulties.”

Vahrenholt says all the recent “panic is leading policymakers into making errors and will lead to disappointment for the youth because it is not doable.” He adds changing over the green energies is needed ultimately, but this cannot be done over a short time period of a decade or two. He says “we need two generations” to get off fossil fuels and that it’s going to require “more innovation and research in order to get CO2 emissions down to acceptable levels by the end of the century.”
Vahrenholt, the former director of renewable energies company Innogy, says he is also puzzled over why Germany refuses to do research on fusion and remains so fixated on unstable sun and wind. Vahrenholt was one for the 500 scientists who recently signed a letter to the UN declaring that the planet was not facing a climate crisis.
97% consensus claim distorted
On the claim 97% agree that man is behind global warming, Vahrenholt says this figure has been completely misrepresented, and that it is in fact “only a handful of scientists” who say that man is 100% responsible. Many scientists say that man is only partly responsible.
Chinese are laughing
The outspoken German professor of chemistry says giving in to the demands of the radical greens would lead to a deindustrialized Germany: “In the end what’s left is a deindustrialized Germany, and the Chinese are laughing their heads off.”
Leaders lack courage
On the large Fridays for Future protests, Vahrenholt says: “It’s not surprising because currently hardly a teacher, hardly a journalist, hardly a scientist has the  courage to say: ‘Dear millions of people, we find it nice that you’re concerned about the climate, but let’s really discuss among each other what really needs to be done, and how much time we have.’ This really annoys me. I may not always be right, but I’m pretty sure that the alarmists are not right.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman climate blogger Snow Fan here presents some background on Australian bush fires. 
It turns out that the 1974/75 bush fires were considerably larger in area than the 2019/20 bush fires we have been witnessing.

The Australian bush fires of 2019/20 have seen an area as big as southern Germany (see above). But in 1974/75, they covered an area as large as France and Spain combined! Source: www.wetteronline.de. 
Snow fan writes:
On the completely exaggerated climate alarm in the German media on the current bush fires in Australia, a pleasantly objective report from WetterOnline: ‘In the summer of 1974/1975, an area in Australia burned to the tune of about the size of Spain and France. For the sake of perspective: Bush fires are generally nothing unusual in the Australian summer. Often large areas are affected. The last time a huge fire raged was in February 2009. The so-called Black-Saturday-bush fires killed over 170 people and destroyed 1800 houses. […] Since the beginning of the great bush fires in October 2019, more than 100,000 square kilometres of land burned throughout Australia, which is roughly the size of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg combined. Thousands of houses were destroyed.'”
Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg have a combined area of around 105,000 square kilometers, so there’s no doubt this season’s bush fires have been devastating.
But WetterOnline reminds Australia has seen much worse:
 In the summer of 1974/1975 the flames burned over an area of about one million square kilometers. This corresponds to an area about three times the size of Germany.”
That means an area that is nine times greater than what has been affected this year! Back in 1975, however, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were BELOW the “safe” 350 ppm.

So not surprisingly a number of cities led by socialist/green governments have attempted to implement electric public transportation buses, declaring they are the future of clean mobility.

Electric powered buses still struggling to be successful. Image: Flixbus
But Tichy’s Einblick just recently reported on the results of attempted electric bus fleets across Germany. They are not pretty.
Electrically driven public transport by bus is still a long way off.
FlixBus suspends electric bus after “repeated technical problems”
One example, Tichy’s Einblick cites, is German intercity bus carrier FlixBus, which worked with Greenpeace to promote the electric bus on the route between Mannheim and Frankfurt as a showcase project – all accompanied by ample fanfare and slogans such as “sustainable travel” and “the mobility of the future is green”.
But last April Greenpeace reported the discontinuation of the first nationwide electric long-distance bus line: “The long-distance bus provider announced on Wednesday that there had been repeated technical problems during the pilot project between Mannheim and Frankfurt with the vehicle of a Chinese manufacturer. These problems with the bus of Chinese manufacturer BYD must have been so massive that the project was suspended.”
Tichy’s Einblick reports the “only one thing that was really sustainable about the project was the disappointment of the travelers.”
Wiesbaden: 45 million euros, only on flat routes
Tichy’s Einblick also looked at the city of Wiesbaden where city bus operator ESWE Stadtwerke ordered 56 electric buses in April of this year and the first five were to run in October, with another five to follow in November. But so far none have “made any further progress yet”.

Wiesbaden plans a total of 140 electric buses, all to be supported by 45 million euros in taxpayers’ money from the Federal Environment Ministry. Yet Tichy’s Einblick reports that only the “flat inner city stretches are to be served” and that “they do not dare to venture onto the steeper streets on the outskirts.”
Also: “A battery charge should last 150 kilometers, but less if the temperatures are freezing and the bus is full: 100 kilometers.” That would mean about 3 hours of service before a recharge becomes needed.
Nürtingen electric bus pilot “a flop”…battery 80,000 euros!
In the city of Nürtingen, “The electric bus pilot project is a flop,” says Tichy’s Einblick. “The battery on a bus was broken after two and a half years of operation, and a new one costs 80,000 euros. Too much – that’s why the operation is stopped.”
Trier: buses taken out of service after just 2 weeks
Tichy’s Einblick also sarcastically reports that since July, “The electric buses in Trier have proven to be truly quiet and environmentally friendly: They are idol.”
“Already after two weeks the first electric bus had to stay in the workshop. Reason: Problems with the battery. An end of the problems is not in sight,” according toTichy’s Einblick.
Bremen backs off electric bus plans: “many disadvantages”
The failures of the electric buses on German streets has not gone unnoticed. Even the Green/Socialist government of the northern city of Bremen has made “a 180-degree turn”.
Earlier the city had planned to purchase five electric buses, 40 percent of which were to be funded by the federal government. But the Bremen city government opted out of the plan. “The reason: It is still unclear whether the electric drive really is the technology of the future.”
According to Tichy’s Einblick: “Bremen Mayor Maike Schaefer (Green Party) says that e-mobility has many disadvantages: ‘The batteries need cobalt, which comes from mines in the Congo. Exploitative child labor prevails there.'”
“Currently, the electric vehicles also have such a short service life that their carbon footprint does not represent any real progress compared with conventional technologies,” writes Tichy’s Einblick.

"Until relatively recently, lots of different massive mammals roamed across our planet. Mastodons, mammoths, giant elk, rhinoceros-sized marsupials, sabre-toothed cats, marsupial lions, dire wolves, American cheetahs … the list goes on and on. Then modern humans spread throughout the world and the vast majority of those large species disappeared. Our planet’s large mammal biodiversity is a shade of what it once was.  Sadly, research we’ve carried out shows that the large mammal extinctions of the past 2.5m years are continuing today – and smaller species are now also threatened. Our new study, published in Science Advances, reviewed the threats, status and ecosystem services provided by the 74 largest terrestrial herbivores (exceeding 100kg in body mass), and the conservation effort required to save them from extinction.  Our results are highly concerning. The vast majority of these large herbivores are declining in distribution and abundance, such that 60% are now threatened with extinction. These include well-known and iconic species such as elephants, hippos, all species of rhino, European bison and Indian water buffalo, but also less well-known species such as takin, kouprey, mountain and lowland anoa, and tamaraw. The situation is likely to get worse and we risk leaving empty landscapes unless urgent and drastic action is undertaken. Hunting, habitat loss and competition for food with livestock are the major threats to the world’s large herbivores. Simply identifying these threats is perhaps the most optimistic result of our study, as these are all issues that can be managed and reduced, provided there is sufficient human will to do so.  While Africa supports the greatest number of large herbivore species, south-east Asia retains the most that are threatened. The region’s woodlands are facing empty forest syndrome – where they seem intact, but there are few large animals left within them.  Overwhelmingly, it is developing countries that host the remaining megafauna – they are largely gone from the developed world. Consequently, these poorer nations bear the costs of protecting large herbivores, as well as the missed opportunity costs of setting aside large areas of land for conservation rather than food production. The developed world offers paltry support. Research efforts also suffer from this same disparity. Data deficiency is the bane of conservation management, yet the most-studied large herbivores are the common game species. We know next to nothing about large and highly threatened wild pigs such as Oliver’s warty pig or the Palawan bearded pig, for instance. Without adequate and targeted funding, it is hard to see this research occurring before it is too late for many of the developing world’s big herbivores. A world without elephants, tapirs, hippos, giraffes or gorillas would be a much poorer place. Large herbivores are inspirational, and huge numbers of tourists travel the world to observe them. Yet these species also perform fundamental roles in the ecosystems they inhabit and their loss would substantially alter the natural world. African elephants knock over trees enabling shrubland to develop, for example. This shrubland benefits browsing species such as impalas and black rhinos. Elephants also make great seed dispersers and there are concerns that this ecosystem service is being lost in parts of Asia and Africa where they are becoming scarce. Other large herbivores have also been shown to have a disproportionate impact on their environment, such that their decline is likely to have repercussions right along the food chain. The return of bears and wolves to Europe illustrates that developed countries can succeed in conserving wildlife. These large carnivores can also play fundamental roles in their ecosystems, often by limiting numbers of common herbivores such as rabbit or deer, yet globally carnivores are also still in decline.  There are plans to reintroduce beavers, lynx and wild boar in the UK, as wolves have been returned to Yellowstone National Park in the US. But what about the mega-herbivores? Why don’t we bring back herds of wild cattle (the ecological equivalent and modern variant of the extinct aurochs) to the UK? Governments are inherently risk averse when it comes to conservation initiatives, but they must start acting before it is too late for these majestic creatures."
"Coastal floods are a major global hazard. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis generated a five-metre storm surge along the coast of southern Myanmar. This swept seawater 50km inland, killing a staggering 130,000 people. In 2013, Typoon Haiyan swept across the central Philippines, killing 8,000 people and destroying a million homes, with much of the damage due to high sea levels. The past decade witnessed two of the most costly natural disasters in US history: Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Sandy in 2012. Coastal flooding from these two events resulted in 1,000 deaths and billions of dollars in damage. In the UK, an unusually severe sequence of coastal flooding caused enormous damage during winter 2013-14. The world’s coastal population keeps growing and these floods are a reminder of the risks. Coastal flooding is caused by combinations of high tides, storm surges and large waves. A storm surge is a big rise in sea level caused by strong winds pushing sea water towards the coast where it “piles up”; and by low pressure at the centre of storms which “pulls” the sea surface up by about a centimetre for every millibar. The worst coastal flooding often occurs when the timing of the peak storm surge coincides with high spring tide. The fact that coastal flooding is caused by high sea levels is obvious enough. But surprisingly, we currently do not record which extreme sea level rises spill over into extreme floods.  To improve our understanding of coastal flooding, and to assess just how unusual 2013-14 was, we have compiled a new database and described in Scientific Data. Our work provides a systematic UK-wide record of coastal floods over the past hundred years. It currently contains data on 96 major floods, with information for each on the storm that generated it, the high-water level reached, and the severity of coastal flooding. We have also developed a website called “SurgeWatch”, to make the information easily accessible, and freely available to scientists, coastal engineers, and planners. We’re aiming to expand the database and we want you to help. Do you have any photographs of coastal flooding from recent or past events which you are willing to share? Photos can be easily uploaded to our website. We want to investigate these in order to improve understanding of exactly which areas were flooded and to what water depth. The database has allowed us to identify which historic storms resulted in the worst coastal flooding over the last 100 years, and we have mapped the specific paths of the storms responsible for these events. What is particularly evident is that coastal floods can “cluster”. That is, you get seasons and even decades of calm with relative little happening, and other periods when floods occur in rapid succession. Winter 2013-14 was particularly unusual, featuring seven out of the 96 floods in the 100-year database and two of the top ten; no other season comes close. Now that we know more accurately which seasons and decades had the largest number of coastal flooding events, we are examining properties (such as sea surface temperature) of the North Atlantic ocean the year before, to see if this provides clues as to how stormy the following season may be. If there are links, and the ocean contributes to the clustering of storms in a period, then there is scope to develop seasonal forecasting that could supplement the short term forecasting currently provided by the UK Coastal Monitoring and Forecasting Service, which provides warnings of impending high sea levels, helping people to prepare for flooding emergencies. The UK coastline has been subject to terrible floods throughout history and accurate forecasting would have been useful. In 1607, up to 2,000 people were drowned around the Bristol Channel, the greatest loss of life from a natural catastrophe in the UK during the past 500 years. The worst natural disaster in modern times was the “Big Flood” of 1953. In south-east England, 307 people were killed and 24,000 people fled their homes, and almost 2,000 lives were also lost in the Netherlands and Belgium. This event was the driving force behind the Thames Barrier which protects London from storm surges, and other flood defence schemes around the country. It also led to the establishment of the UK monitoring service.  The fact the 2013-14 damage was so limited compared to the tragedy of 1953 is thanks to significant government investment in coastal defences, flood forecasting and sea level monitoring. Our work helps create a direct link between the latter two."
"My mother died recently and at the funeral home I was asked if I had any ideas what kind of coffin she would like. For some reason I said something environmentally friendly. These words came out of my mouth more out of nervousness than anything previously discussed with my mother. Duly the undertaker showed us a catalogue of wicker coffins and we chose one made of banana leaves. I often think of my carbon footprint – I have not owned a car in more than 15 years, for example – but I had never thought about my “green obligations” in death. My mother may not have requested an environmentally friendly coffin, but she did state she wished to be cremated. Due to the lack of space in the UK around 80% of people request cremation – and if we think about green space being at a premium this makes ecological sense. However the energy required to cremate a single person is equal to the energy they would use in a month if they were alive. In the UK this translates to a yearly energy consumption of a town of 16,000 people.  In Asian countries where cremation is very popular there is considerable interest in using solar power to reduce such energy consumption. Another problem with cremation is air pollution, which obviously depends on the filtering system being employed. Until recent times cremations were one of the major sources of mercury pollution in the UK due to the amalgam fillings in people’s teeth. A group of environmental NGOs recently called on the EU to curb mercury emissions from human cremation. Furthermore, the clothes worn and use of embalming fluids may also increase air pollution. Humans have buried their dead for at least 100,000 years. Therefore, not wishing to throw the baby out with the bathwater, I looked into different burial options. A woodland burial initially appealed to me.  However, I would only really approve of this if it resulted in the maintenance of a high-quality conservation area and wildlife refuge. And I wonder if it became popular enough if it could result in major reforestation of the UK. But bodies would still be rotting in the ground releasing globally warming methane gas. Surely, there must be greener options than a standard burial or cremation?  Coming from a family of fishermen I thought about burial at sea, as the fish could recycle my body quickly.  But there are only three registered places in the UK and only around 50 such burials per year. As a biologist, I find the idea of becoming fish food strangely appealing. This is not a new idea: I remember reading of man who macabrely wished the meat from his body fed to the residents at Battersea Dogs Home. Not surprisingly this strange offer was declined. As a conservationist the idea of recycling my body after death appeals: some Asian cultures have what are called sky burials, where a dead human body is laid out on a mountain top for scavenging animals such as birds of prey to feed on.   From a biological point of view I cannot see anything wrong with this, providing deceased people do not have contagious diseases. Burials in the ground are more to do with people not wishing the body disturbed by animals than hygiene considerations – hence being buried six feet. Unfortunately, as much as I like to imagine my deceased body on the top of Ben Nevis being recycled by golden eagles, I can never see it being allowed in the UK. I suppose what really appeals to me is being fully recycled in a short time-frame. The problem is that cremation does not fully recycle the body and burials can take years for the recycling process to occur. Thus, if my body could be fully recycled quickly into the nutrient cycles, thereby allowing the burial plot to be constantly reused then I may have found a biologically acceptable method to dispose of my body when the time comes. A company in Sweden has tested a concept of eco-burial on dead pigs (pigs are good models for the human body), whereby the animal is frozen in liquid nitrogen at -196℃, which makes the body become brittle and disintegrate. In the case of a human, the disintegrated body would be filtered for metals (such as tooth fillings) and then buried in a shallow grave.  In tests with pigs the remains become rich compost in six to twelve months.  Plus this sort of eco-burial does not release greenhouse gases such as methane (from traditional burials) or carbon (from cremations) into the atmosphere.  The only problem being it is still in development."

No thats not the title of a new Godzilla movie, but “Deep Fried Rodan” could be.
My friends in journalism say news goes in cycles. If that is so, this must be the year of the creepy crawly restaurant.
Today I see on the TV news the shocking video (a frame of which is shown above) of the Kentucky Fried Chicken combo Taco Bell in New York City’s Greenwich Village that has been taken over by rats and closed down by the health department.
What’s in those buckets anyway? Just kidding, and the trademark bucket in the picture above had a little help using Photoshop. But it makes you wonder just how many restaurants in America are as bad as this?
Oddly, it was exactly one year ago today that we had the China Star meltdown, where police and fire responders to a burglar alarm found a restaurant so incredibly filthy and pest ridden, it defied description.
In his ER article last year,  reporter Ari Cohn and Chico PD officer Melody Davidson’s incident report did an admirable job in conveying the heebie jeebies via the written word to anyone whom ever ate there. Today reading the news reports online and then seeing the videos, it was “like Deja Vu all over again”.
I wrote a letter to the editor last year suggesting we need to have color coded health inspection reports posted in the entrance of every restaurant showing its last inspection status. Green for Pass, Yellow for some minor violations, and Red for get the heck outta there ! I still think its a good idea.
Some progress has been made, as now you can get inspection reports online at  Butte County’s Health Department. Here is the link: http://www.buttecounty.net/Default.aspx?tabid=312
Reading through the list of inspection reports at the Butte Health Dept website, I was surprised to learn that even some well known and considered “classy” Chico restaurants had some major violations in the last year. If you eat out a lot, this website is worth a look. Any enterprise that sells packaged food, serves food or food samples, including school cafeterias, coffee houses, country clubs, fraternal clubs, and even liquor stores get inspected by the County Health Department.
Here’s a surprising fact: Indian Casinos and their restaurants are exempt from inspections, because tribal operations are considered their own sovereign nation. That may be so, but I think any place that could potentially make people sick through sloppy food handling shouldn’t get a free pass on a legal technicality.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarth’s atmosphere is made of 78% nitrogen (N2) and 21% oxygen (O2). The “consensus” view is N2 and O2 are not greenhouse gases (GHGs) and don’t absorb infrared radiation (IR). But scientists have been saying N2 absorbs and radiates IR since 1944 and more recent (2012, 2016) studies have found N2 and O2 are “radiatively important” greenhouse gases with IR temperature absorption capacities similar to CO2.
It’s been known for 75 years that nitrogen – the Earth’s most prevalent atmospheric gas – absorbs and “strongly” radiates infrared energy (Stebbins et al., 1944)

Image Source: Stebbins et al., 1944
Methane (CH4) is thought to be an 84 times more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.

Nitrogen, oxygen are “natural greenhouse gases”
Scientists (Höpfner et al., 2012) publishing in Geophysical Research Letters dispute the “common perception” that nitrogen and oxygen – accounting for 78% and 21% of the Earth’s atmospheric gases – do not contribute signficantly to the Earth’s greenhouse effect.
They assert N2 and O2 are “radiatively important” “natural greenhouse gases” primarily because their concentration is “about 2000 (550) times higher than that of CO2 and about 4.4 × 105 (1.2 × 105) times more abundant than CH4.”
Nitrogen, oxygen combined are more potent GHGs than methane
The atmospheric abundance of N2 and O2 compensates for their relatively weaker IR function (when directly compared to CH4).
For example, “the natural greenhouse effect of N2 and O2 would be larger than that of CH4 by a factor of 1.3” when considering their combined isolated GHE influence.
Further, the reduction in the atmosphere’s infrared transmission amounts to 25.7% for N2, 14.2% for O2, and only 6.9% for CH4.
Nitrogen’s greenhouse gas influence also rivals CO2’s
Höpfner and colleagues also suggest N2 reduces outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) by 4.6 W/m² compared to CO2’s 5.1 W/m² when assesing their solo absorption capacity. This would appear to be a rather minor difference.
If the number of N2 molecules in the atmosphere were hypothetically doubled, it would produce a 12 W/m² longwave greenhouse effect forcing.

Doubling CO2 from 280 ppm to 560 ppm only yields a 3.7 W/m² radiative forcing.
The authors reject the “view that the radiative forcing of N2 increase operates only indirectly by broadening the absorption lines of other gases.” Instead, N2 has a “direct impact” (as well as an indirect impact) within greenhouse effect forcing.

Image Source: Höpfner et al., 2012
Experiment: nitrogen, oxygen absorb IR to about the same limiting temperature as CO2
A real-world experiment (Allmendinger, 2016) assessing the efficacy of CO2’s IR-absorption temperature capacity relative to air (N2, O2) and Argon (Ar) further establishes CO2 is not the “special” GHG it is commonly thought to be.
Twin styrofoam Saran-wrap-sealed tubes exposed to sunlight were used, one with pure (1,000,000 ppm) CO2 and the other with air (N2, O2) and/or Ar.
The results were admittedly “surprising” given expectations CO2 would operate as a radiatively distinct GHG.
The tube absorbing IR with N2 and O2 (air) and Ar warmed to a temperature limit quite similar to (55°C to 58°C) the temperature limit in the 100% CO2 tube (58°C).
There was no remarkable or  “special” heat absorption capacity for CO2 relative to air observed. And Argon – not considered a greenhouse gas – absorbed IR to the same temperature limit as CO2. With a concentration of 9300 ppm, Ar is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth’s atmosphere.
Because there is so little to distinguish CO2 from the most abundant gas molecules in Earth’s atmosphere, Dr. Allmendinger assesses “a significant efect of carbon-dioxide on the direct sunlight absorption can already be exluded.”
Further, “the greenhouse theory has to be questioned.”

I just completed my first meeting of the City of Chico Sustainability Task Force today and here are a few observations.
First, it seemed to be pretty well rounded, we had public and private sector, business, building industry, CSUC, and regular citizens represented by the 15 appointees.
Second, so far the focus seems to be doing things better, more efficiently, and at less cost. I’m all for that.
Third, everybody seemed to get along, no shouting matches or fistfights broke out.
While the group is still feeling their way, I expect that given the makeup of it, we’ll get some useful suggestions and ideas from it that may very well get implemented as policy someday. I was worried that we might have a group of folks who were so focused on the goal of “green” that we’d see odd policy come from it like our famously silly nuclear weapons ban in the city limits.
I’ll keep you posted. I have a few ideas of my own that I’ll discuss here.
Some folks ask me how I can be against the idea of man-made global warming but for alternate energy. Its simple really, if its more efficient, pollutes less (on any venue) has no social cost, and has a lower operating cost, I’m for it. Mostly I’m for alternate energy becuase California has essentially legislated out the ability to build any traditional forms of energy generation, such as coal, hydro, and nuclear. That leaves wind, solar, and conservation as the future of energy in California. whether you beleive in man-made global warming or not, our future energy needs have to come from some source, so we’d better get started now. If they have beneficial side effects, all the better.
One thing I’m not for is a carbon credits/trading programs. I think the whole idea is simply a cop out and designed to benefit the few that setup these programs. See why in this post.

"When a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan in March 2011, I was on the 9th floor of a 20-storey Tokyo hotel. The quake was one of the five most powerful since modern record keeping began in 1900, and it lasted for around three minutes – an unusually long time.  Countless lives were saved by Japanese engineering. The tsunami that followed – and the resulting Fukushima meltdown – was a terrible tragedy, but the earthquake itself could also have caused far greater loss of life. It actually did very little damage relative to its magnitude. The fact that buildings like the one I was in, and thousands of others, remained intact shows just how important good earthquake engineering is. In Nepal, which was recently struck by a 7.8 magnitude earthquake, the problem is quite different. A combination of poverty, a lack of specialised knowledge and poor regulation mean most houses were never built to such standards in the first place. Therefore it is these houses that retrofitting efforts – and my research in the country – must focus on. As recent events have reminded us, it is collapsing structures that kill people during earthquakes and rarely the shaking itself. Engineers, through intensive and persistent analysis of past earthquakes have mastered the art of building houses to resist shaking and to avoid collapse.  However, such earthquake-resistant buildings are expensive and need specialised knowledge and skills – it’s not something any old builder/architect combo can knock out overnight. There are specialised MSc courses and even doctorates in the subject – and engineers need continuous professional development to keep pace with the latest research. Japan has these skills and resources in abundance; a poorer nation such as Nepal, not so much. Houses in Nepal are built with traditional knowledge and often without any engineer’s visit – the technical term is non-engineered buildings – and it is difficult to make them withstand earthquakes of large magnitude.  In such scenarios, it is often prudent to rein in expectations and aim for the “least bad” outcome by increasing the time it takes for the house to collapse. If, instead of two seconds, the building collapses in 12 seconds it may give the occupants enough time to escape. The collapse of non-engineered masonry buildings is one of the greatest causes of casualties in major earthquakes around the world. Yet by definition these non-engineered structures remain largely outside of the scope of modern engineering research, focused as it is on new technologies and new buildings – fancy new quake-proof skyscrapers command significantly more funding than the unglamourous task of seismic retrofitting. This means that the majority of those at risk often remain so.  Even where research is focused on non-engineered housing, there are still significant social and economic challenges before implementation. It’s all very well asking people in Tokyo to pay a premium for seismic proofing, but Nepal’s gross national income per capita is US$730 – just two dollars a day. My research is aimed at developing retrofitting techniques which will prevent or prolong the collapse of adobe (mud brick) houses in strong earthquakes. We used common plastic packaging straps to form a mesh, which is then used to encase structural walls.  Tests showed that the proposed technique effectively prevents brittle masonry collapse and the loss of debris. We then trained rural masons in Nepal, gave a public “shake-table” demonstration and retrofitted a real house.  This implementation project proved effective at reaching rural communities but highlighted the fact that government subsidies are still required to give low-income people the incentive to safeguard their homes against the next big earthquake."

Within the last few years, over 50 papers have been added to our compilation of scientific studies that find the climate’s sensitivity to doubled CO2 (280 ppm to 560 ppm) ranges from <0 to 1°C. When no quantification is provided, words like “negligible” are used to describe CO2’s effect on the climate. The list has now reached 106 scientific papers.


Link: 100+ Scientific Papers – Low CO2 Climate Sensitivity


A few of the papers published in 2019 are provided below.
Krainov and Smirnov, 2019  (2X CO2 = 0.4°C, 2X anthroCO2 = 0.02°C)
“The greenhouse phenomenon in the atmosphere that results from emission of its molecules and particles in the infrared spectrum range is determined by atmospheric water in the form of molecules and microdrops and by carbon dioxide molecules for the Earth atmosphere and by carbon dioxide molecules and dust for the Venus atmosphere. The line-by-line method used the frequency dependent radiative temperature for atmospheric air with a large optical thickness in the infrared spectral range, allows one to separate emission of various components in atmospheric emission. This method demonstrates that the removal of carbon dioxide from the Earth’s atmosphere leads to a decrease of the average temperature of the Earth’s surface by 4 K; however, doubling of the carbon dioxide amount causes an increase of the Earth’s temperature by 0.4 K from the total 2 K at CO2 doubling in the real atmosphere, as it follows from the NASA measurements. The contribution to this temperature change due to injections of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due to combustion of fossil fuel, and it is 0.02 K. The infrared radiative flux to the Venus surface due to   CO2 is about 30% of the total flux, and the other part is determined by a dust.”

Image Source: Krainov and Smirnov, 2019

Ollila, 2019 (2XCO2= 0.6°C)
“If a climate model using the positive water feedback were applied to the GH effect magnitude of this study, it would fail worse than a model showing a TCS value of 1.2°C. If there were a positive water feedback mechanism in the atmosphere, there is no scientific grounding to assume that this mechanism would start to work only if the CO2 concentration exceeds 280 ppm, and actually, the IPCC does not claim so. The absolute humidity and temperature observations show that there is no positive water feedback mechanism in the atmosphere during the longer time periods. … The contribution of CO2 in the GH effect is 7.3% corresponding to 2.4°C in temperature. The reproduction of CO2 radiative forcing (RF) showed the climate sensitivity RF value to be 2.16 Wm-2, which is 41.6% smaller than the 3.7 Wm-2 used by the IPCC. A climate model showing a climate sensitivity (CS) of 0.6°C matches the CO2 contribution in the GH effect, but the IPCC’s climate model showing a CS of 1.8°C or 1.2°C does not.”

Varotsos and Efstathiou, 2019
“The enhancement of the atmospheric greenhouse effect due to the increase in the atmospheric greenhouse gases is often considered as responsible for global warming (known as greenhouse hypothesis of global warming). In this context, the temperature field of global troposphere and lower stratosphere over the period 12/1978–07/2018 is explored using the recent Version 6 of the UAH MSU/AMSU global satellite temperature dataset. Our analysis did not show a consistent warming with gradual increase from low to high latitudes in both hemispheres, as it should be from the global warming theory. … Based on these results and bearing in mind that the climate system is complicated and complex with the existing uncertainties in the climate predictions, it is not possible to reliably support the view of the presence of global warming in the sense of an enhanced greenhouse effect due to human activities.”

"Sometimes you can see the end of the old world and the beginning of the new one as clearly as a seam. Transformations that were once barely perceptible, recognisable only after the fact, this summer have become akin to a crossing. You can see the line as you step over it. It’s the first summer of this new decade. Welcome. It’s the summer of ash washed up on the beaches, like a long, deranged message unfurled from its bottle. It’s the summer of a billion animals killed by flames and starvation, it’s collapsed biospheres, charred forests, epic dust storms, hailstones and racing clouds carrying fire.  It’s the summer of the worst air quality in the world, of breathing masks and of keeping children indoors. It’s the summer of cancelled holidays, of anxious evacuations on jammed roads out of coastal hamlets. It’s fire raining on beaches, and skies that glow red at night and darken in the day. It’s the summer that Australia’s colours on Instagram went from saturated to sepia, starting in early December when people in Sydney shared photos of the weird red sun. The image at first seemed singular and disorienting until it was repeated so often (so many skies, in different cities, on so many feeds) it just came to be disorienting, and later very familiar. It’s the summer of asking about people’s holiday plans and also their fire plans. It’s the summer of both generalised and specific anxiety – where despair and dread coalesced into a sort of collective bad vibe and common understanding that this is a terrible summer. It’s the summer when faith in the political class entered some new, nihilistic nadir, where the national hero was the volunteer firefighter who said on camera that the prime minister should “get fucked” and if we believed in such a thing as a centre we would say this was the summer the centre no longer held. But it’s also the summer where we held and kept faith with each other: people saving their neighbour’s home at risk to their own safety; people driving hundreds of kilometres with food for fire-affected regions; people donating water to drought-stricken farms; every coffee shop and concert and celebrity hosting a fundraiser. It’s the summer when what we thought of as the union between humans and the natural world seemed suddenly and irrevocably rent. The contract was nullified. The collapse appeared total at times. A billion animals died. Some species may never return. It’s the summer when climate change stopped being something we talked and argued about, an abstract thing to be debated. Instead it was the ash we breathed into our bodies, the devastation we saw with our eyes and pain felt in our hearts. When you feel it there, you can no longer deny it. * * * Those of us several degrees removed from the fire zone – who had stayed in the cities or on the unburnt side of Victoria – experienced fires as an anxiety-generating, feral echo. It was the smoke in the air and sudden drops in temperatures – 46 degrees one day, 20 the next, dust storms and large lumps of hail. This summer, Sydney was a ghost town, populated by sad looking people in breathing masks. The lockout laws were repealed but it seemed like a bad time to restart the party. People stayed at home and ordered UberEats. The world’s media reported our situation with alarm. For a nation that craves attention we should have been pleased to be first at something. But being on the frontline of a major climate catastrophe didn’t feel so good. Expats felt a sudden need to return home, the way you rush to the airport and board a red eye to visit a relative on their deathbed. Some immigrants who had come for the “lifestyle” were similarly rethinking their choices, and talking of making the journey in reverse. The good life in Australia wasn’t looking so good any more. For Australians, a collective grief emerged. We yearned for the past. All summer, we spoke of previous summers – long, dusky days and evenings at the beach, unbroken weeks of sunshine and clear water, skin browning, and the days and weeks merging like a hot, salty dream – as if they were scenes from another epoch, a lost idyll. Part of the anxiety of this summer was that the idyll might be gone forever. In its place was strange, unpredictable weather and humans and animals that moved through this weather tentatively and with a measure of fear. It’s the summer where for the first time I heard people, young people not usually prone to hyperbole or paranoia, speak plainly about the world ending. My Sydney GP told me he had seen four people already that day with climate change-related anxiety and depression. He was offering them antidepressants. At a lunch in Bondi, someone said we have 60 harvests left before the world will run out of food. That everyone she told was alarmed and also accepting of this, and that also no one seemed to know exactly what a harvest was (is it annual, we asked – like yearly??) seemed to be both an allegory and an explanation for how we had got here. After some weeks of weird weather and non-stop fire news around the start of January, there were detectable Weimar republic vibes. Strange currents moved between unlikely people. Friends who lead stable middle-class lives had uncharacteristic nights of chaos, and found themselves going home with strange men they’d met in bars, or on drug binges with kids they had mentored, or discussing with their friends whether they would or would not kill themselves if the climate catastrophe got too bad. I found myself deep in plans with strangers to join some agrarian farming collective they were starting in the Otways and accepting detailed advice about how to build a bunker on my property, which I was scared enough to actually contemplate because my fire plan involved escaping on a bicycle. Meanwhile, all throughout this summer, the smoke moved around us, like a viral social media campaign, documented and populating the social media feeds of people first in Sydney, then Canberra and later Melbourne. One day in mid-January I woke up in my cottage in central Victoria and there it was – a heavy taint in the air that had the previous day smelt so pure and clean, of oat grass dried in the wind. That day it was hot and a friend and I went swimming in a reservoir out of town. The water was brackish and warm and all around was the bush, dry, silent and crackling in the 35-degree heat. As we rounded the bend (dense forest on either side, the tall gums bent and meeting like a cathedral roof) the scene was not one we interpreted as picturesque but through the lens of the Pyrocene. “Imagine all this on fire,” my friend said as we drove through it. How much of this summer is not just imagining yourself in another’s place but is the collective collapse between imagination and reality? This summer we no longer have to imagine any more. • Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterInternational and NASA solar scientists find their Total Solar Irradiance reconstruction extending to 1700 can “correlate well” with Earth’s global temperature records, including a positive net TSI trend during 1986-2008. A new Grand Solar Minimum is expected to commence during the 2030s.
Surface climate records that have been uncorrupted by coastal (ocean-air)/urbanization biases suggest there has been a long-term oscillation in temperature since 1900, with peaks during the 1920s-1940s and again during recent decades (Lansner and Pepke Pedersen, 2018).

An analysis by Soon et al. (2015) (full paper) indicated Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures from rural locations (unaffected by artificial urban heat) aligned well with trends in solar activity since the 19th century. However, models of greenhouse gas forcing did not correlate well with the long-term hemispheric record.

A new paper (Scafetta et al., 2019) also finds the global temperature record aligns well with trends in TSI when using the observation-based ACRIM satellite data rather than the model-based (and IPCC-preferred) PMOD data for trends in recent decades.

“By adjusting the TSI proxy models to agree with the data patterns before and after the ACRIM-gap, we found that these models miss a slowly varying TSI component. The adjusted models suggest that the quiet solar luminosity increased from the 1986 to the 1996 TSI minimum by about 0.45 W/m² reaching a peak near 2000 and decreased by about 0.15 W/m² from the 1996 to the 2008 TSI cycle minimum. This pattern is found to be compatible with the ACRIM TSI composite and confirms the ACRIM TSI increasing trend from 1980 to 2000, followed by a long-term decreasing trend since.”
“This model was extended using the ACRIM composite since 1981 and an average between VIRGO and SORCE TIM since 2013. This particular TSI model appeared to correlate well with the Earth’s global surface temperature records since 1700 [Hoyt et al., 1993, . … The TSI data from 1978 to 1981 appeared too corrupted because of uncorrected degradation of theNimbus7/ERB sensors during the solar maximum of cycle 21. For this reason, it was more appropriate to dismiss the data from this period because modifying TSI data using proxy models, as done by PMOD, would be arbitrary. We proposed that any reliable TSI composite should begin from late 1980 with the ACRIM1 record.”
“The same harmonic solar model suggests that the sun may now be heading toward a new grand solar minimum in the 2030–2040 time frame. Final evidence that TSI may have increased from 1980 to 2000 comes from Earth’s climate studies. Secular climate records correlate well with TSI curves such as the one depicted in Figure 13 and on longer ones covering the entire Holocene [1,23,60,64]. In particular, the warming observed from 1970 to 2000, followed by a temperature standstill since 2000, is a good fit for a natural 60-year cycle prediction superimposed to other contributions [20]. This pattern correlates better with a TSI evolution similar to the ACRIM composite [17–21,62,65] than with the CMIP5 general circulation climate model predictions of continuous anthropogenic warming [22]. The CMIP5 climate models use a high climate sensitivity to CO2 forcing and low secular TSI variability proxy models, such as the one proposed in [3], which was calibrated using the PMOD TSI composite model after 1980.”

"Drones, robots and unmanned submarines used to be for military use only. But these days the technology is rapidly advancing and becoming more available for emergency services, farmers, film-makers or the public at large. Those of us working in wildlife research and management also recognise the potential of unmanned vehicles. Across the world today these machines are being used to monitor migrating birds, spawning salmon and orangutans, to map breeding habitats of endangered species, to track threatened caribou and polar bears in the far north, to examine nest contents of birds breeding in inaccessible locations, and to deter poachers in Africa.    As technology and industry continue to develop and the regulatory procedures begin to loosen, we’ll see conservation drones used in even more different ways in the field of wildlife biology. It’s something we’ve been researching at McGill University in Montreal since 2007. Here are a few of the things we are engaged in. We spent our first years using a small fixed-wing drone to successfully fly over and count flocks of Canada and snow geese.  Next, we used the plane to count terns nesting in a large colony in New Brunswick, and were also able to map their favoured nesting habitat. We managed the same for threatened least bitterns in southern Quebec. Efforts to learn about and protect birds of prey are sometimes hampered by their nesting locations – often found in remote areas, on rocky ledges or high up in tall trees. The number one source of mortality on the job for wildlife biologists is dying in a light plane or helicopter crash. A better way to monitor the contents of raptor nests is to use a small GoPro camera attached to a light-weight rotary-winged drone. So far we have used such a machine to survey the nests of ospreys, bald eagles, ferruginous hawks and red-tailed hawks – 113 flights in all. We obtained high-quality images of the nest contents in the vast majority of flights, allowing for an accurate count of eggs or nestlings, as well as useful estimates of the nestling ages.  More importantly, at each nest, we measured how the parents responded to the unexpected visitor. We recorded key behaviour such as how far the birds initially flew away or whether they demonstrated aggressive defensive behaviour, calling out or attacking the drone.   Finally, we approached active nests on foot without flying the aircraft, but still recording parental behaviour. This allowed us to sort out the amount of disturbance caused specifically by the drone versus only human presence at the nest site.  Our work demonstrates that drone aircraft can be a valuable tool for monitoring raptor nests, allowing for a flexible schedule of quick checks with minimal disturbance. Drones are also safer and more accurate than nest checking from light manned aircraft.  Drones can help conservation efforts in non-avian animals too. In Goose Bay, Labrador on Canada’s remote north eastern coast, we attempted to compare the use of a fixed-wing drone with a manned helicopter to acquire images of woodland caribou. The imagery obtained was sufficiently high quality for us to find and identify caribou and even differentiate between adults and calves.  Of course sometimes we may miss animals because they are obscured by trees or  boulders, but we are hoping to be able to factor this into our analyses. We are currently working on estimating the necessary corrections by conducting some detectability studies using plywood sheets as surrogate caribou targets placed in various kinds of habitats, using open versus dense. Eventually we hope to use drones to survey large areas and estimate caribou numbers.    Drones aren’t just used for conserving endangered species – they might also help manage unwanted invaders such as the European starling. These birds were first introduced to North America in 1890 when 60 birds were released in New York. Today, they number 200 million across the continent. Starlings compete with native birds for food and nest sites and a flock can decimate food crops, especially vineyards.  Scaring starlings away from grape crops using stationary propane cannons is ineffective and shooting them with guns is destructive, but what if dispersing these birds could be done non-lethally by using drones? We have designed a mount to attach 4 bear-bangers (loud noise-makers) to a small octacopter. We have conducted some banger firing tests to confirm that everything works safely, and we will begin test flights in several vineyards in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia later this year. Another area of interest to us is tracking wildlife bearing radio transmitters. The objective is to mount an antenna/receiver that will not only pick up signals from the transmitters on the animals so as to identify individuals but also relay the information to a ground station.   As a test case, we are attempting to develop a receiver small and light enough to be affixed to a rotary drone so that we can pick up signals from song sparrows nesting on the Gulf Islands in British Columbia to know that the birds have returned from their wintering grounds. Thus far, we have been able to mount a receiver on a rotary drone and successfully determined that it can pick up signals from transmitters.  Field tests on the wild sparrows begin in 2015."
"Expanding Heathrow airport is unlikely to be compatible with the UK’s target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, leading scientists have said, adding that government policies are lacking in many other key areas from home insulation and transport to carbon capturing. Achieving the net zero goal will require sweeping policy changes, but scientists are concerned that little has so far been forthcoming from ministers.  Home insulation and energy efficiency are essential to reducing carbon emissions from heating, but have been left in a “policy vacuum”, said Dr Charlie Wilson, a reader in energy and climate change at the University of East Anglia. Systems to capture and store carbon dioxide would also be needed, but previous government attempts to kickstart the technology over the past two decades have been abandoned, said Jim Skea, professor of sustainable energy at Imperial College London. Skea said the UK had many advantages over other countries in CCS, such as spent oilfields in the North Sea to use as storage, the skills and infrastructure from oil and gas exploration, and public backing for the technology, but needed the government to step in. Corinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change science at UEA, called for the government to prioritise the net zero goal across all policy areas. “Every minister should have a plan for their own [policy area] on how to reach net zero,” she said. “Some infrastructure must be phased out. Ministers should be preparing in a way that is well coordinated and fair, so that the public are brought on board.” No part of government, and no part of the economy and society, could be left unaffected if the push towards net zero was to be successful, said Skea. “We really need to do it all,” he said. “Nothing can be wiped off the table. No sector can be left to not contribute – really, this needs contributions from absolutely everything.” There is no cabinet minister with responsibility for achieving the net zero target, and no intermediate goals before 2050, apart from the advice on carbon budgets from the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the government’s statutory advisors. On Thursday, the CCC called for major changes to the UK’s land use, including more trees, the restoration of peatland and an end to the burning of grouse moors, to improve the UK’s carbon sinks. The expansion of Heathrow, which was given a green light under Theresa May, was not consistent with the net zero goals, a group of six experts said on Friday. “I find it difficult to imagine we can control emissions from aviation if we continue to build airports,” said Le Quéré. “We absolutely need ambitious plans for mobility and transport. We need a plan that covers roads and airports.” Pierre Friedlingstein, professor of mathematical modelling of climate systems at Exeter University, said: “This is a clear example of not going in the right direction.” Wilson said: “We desperately need consistent, concerted direction [from the government] and building new airport capacity is not that.” Skea said it was possible for people to continue taking flights under a net zero target, but that the rapid growth of flying in recent years must be curtailed. “It’s not that people must stop flying, but that the increase in flying should be less than it otherwise would be,” he said. One way of achieving this fairly would be through a frequent flyer levy, according to Lorraine Whitmarsh, professor of environmental psychology at Cardiff University. “The sense that it is a fair policy is very important,” she said. “These policy interventions are likely to be quite effective.”"

In 2019, weather-related events in Germany caused insured damage to houses, household contents, commerce, industry and motor vehicles amounting to 3.2 billion euros. This is the result of preliminary figures published in a press release by the German Insurance Association (GDV).
The level is thus at the previous year’s level and below the long-term average of around 3.7 billion euros.
“Despite the storm and hail damage to motor vehicles, the overall natural hazard balance is slightly below average”, said GDV President Wolfgang Weiler.
What follows is the GDV annual chart for weather-related damage (in 2019- based euros):









Source: GDV
Insured damage has been below the average for 6 consecutive years, despite, the alarming tones one reads in the GDV press release.
There were also fewer losses due to storms and heavy rain in property insurance. Windstorm and hail and other natural hazards such as heavy rain caused damage amounting to EUR 2.2 billion, which is below the long-term average of EUR 2.7 billion.

“The below-average balance should not hide the fact that there have been repeated heavy local rains with high damages”, Weiler said. “All in all, the year 2019 stands for a number of severe storms, great heat and severe local flooding and is therefore characteristic of extreme weather in Germany as well.”
Experts: Central Europe weather “not more extreme”
Meanwhile Die kalte Sonne site here comments:
Fact: The weather in Central Europe has NOT become more extreme. The only exception is heat waves. The Austrian Central Institute for Meteorology (ZAMG) states that a trend towards more extreme weather in Austria is generally not noticeable:
‘It should be anticipated from the detailed discussion of the development of extreme values in the following sections heat (air temperature) heavy precipitation (precipitation) and storms (wind) that all in all the climate has not become more extreme in the last 200 years. According to the only suitable basis for this assertion – long and quality-checked measurement data – climate variability in Southern Central Europe remained the same or even decreased’.
A similar assumption can be made for the neighboring country Germany. For transparency reasons, the German Insurance Association (GDV) should finally admit this to its customers. Instead, the press release concludes with an advertising message that citizens should please insure themselves even more comprehensively against extreme weather.”

You know you’ve reached critical mass in an argument when you start having editorial cartoons drawn about you.
In this weeks Chico Beat, the editorial cartoon above appeared. While editor Tom Gascoyne would not admit to it being my caricature that was used, a call to artist Steve Ferchaud in Paradise confirmed he used me at Tom’s suggestion of my name.
I consider it high praise to be drawn by Ferchaud, but not so high to be in the Chico Beat.
In any event, by the end of the year 2017, ten plus years from now, we’ll know for sure who’s right. I think it will start to be cooler due to the solar cycle starting to dampen.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEven NASA says it:
Without the Earth’s greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere, the planet would be on average a frigid -18°C.
But because of the preindustrial 280 ppmv CO2 and other GHGs in our atmosphere, the average temperature of the Earth thankfully moves up by 33°C to +15°C (see chart below), based on the Stefan Boltzmann Law.

 
Global warming theorists say the Earth’s surface preindustrial temperature was supposed to be 15°C. And today CO2 is supposed to have warmed it another degree, to 16°C. Image: www.klimamanifest.ch.
And because CO2 has since risen to about 410 ppmv today, the global temperature supposedly should now be about another 1°C warmer (assuming positive feedbacks) bringing the average earth’s temperature to 16°C.
And once the preindustrial level of CO2 gets doubled to 560 ppm, later near the end of this century, global warming alarmists insist the Earth’s temperature will be near 18°C, see chart above.
So we are now supposed to be at 16°C today and warming rapidly. But what is the globe’s real average temperature today? 15.8C? 16.0C? 16.5°C?
Answer: astonishingly the official institutes tell us it is only 14.7°C!
For example, data from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) shows us the global absolute temperatures for the previous 5 years:

Image: www.klimamanifest.ch, data source: WMO in Geneva.
As the image above shows, the global absolute temperature last year was just 14.68°C.
This is 0.32°C COOLER than the 15°C we are supposed to have with 280 ppmv, and a whopping 1.32°C cooler than the 16°C it is supposed to be with the 410 ppmv CO2 we have in our atmosphere today.
So why are we missing over 1.3°C of heat? Why is there this huge discrepancy between scientists?
German scientists say Earth temperature was 15.5°C – in 1990!
In May, 1990, even the German government stated in its major report on climate (BT-DRS 11/8030, p. 29) that the global average temperature back then was 15.5°C and that the natural temperature was supposed to be 15°C — like NASA says. The German government reiterated that figure in 1992.

In 2003, renowned German climate scientist Prof. Mojib Latif also confirmed in his book that 15°C was the “optimum temperature” for the Earth.
And in his 2003 doctorate dissertation, Tim Staeger wrote that the natural Earth’s temperature without man-made impacts is “about 15°C”.
In fact, practically all German textbooks used at schools today say that the “natural temperature” of the Earth due to the greenhouse effects of the atmosphere is a “life-friendly average of 15°C” instead of -18°C.
PIK scientist: “15°C in 1850”
Moreover, Potsdam institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) scientist Anders Levermann testified before the German Parliament last year, and confirmed that the global mean temperature of the Earth back in 1850 was 15°C, which means today it is supposed to be well over 16°C. So why is the WMO telling us it’s only 14.68°C and others like the PIK and NASA saying it’s about 16°C?
This massive discrepancy needs to be explained.
IPCC 2007 report in line with WMO
The IPCC indeed contradicts all the scientists and media who claim the global average temperature was 15°C back in 1850. Here’s the IPCC chart from the 2007 report:

How can 14.68°C be “too hot”?
As the chart above shows, the IPCC stated that the global mean temperature in 1850 was a relatively frigid 13.7°C – i.e. well below the “life-friendly” average of 15°C.
Today we are still below the 15°C, and so how can it be too hot?
Summary
There’s no doubt it’s gotten warmer since 1850, the peak of the Little Ice Age. But it’s clear nobody knows what the globe’s real average temperature is. Figures are being wildly tossed around. If we are to believe the IPCC’s 14.7°C figure, then we are still too cool and there is absolutely no warming crisis.
Scientists need to answer this question behind this huge discrepancy quickly. Would the real global temperature please stand up!

"Intense floods and storms around the world could double in frequency within 13 years, as climate breakdown and socioeconomic factors combine, according to a new study. The authors of the analysis say it’s the first to incorporate historical local and global climate data and information about population density, income and poverty to estimate how many hard-hitting disasters to expect. They counted floods and storms that would affect 1,000 people or kill 100 people.  Broadly, the researchers also see governments around the world as critically unprepared. The authors found very high risks for countries such as Australia, Bangladesh and China. Risks are highest for countries that are already seeing far more extreme events than the global average. The study is published in the peer-reviewed Climate, Disaster and Development Journal. Co-author Vinod Thomas, a visiting professor at the Asian Institute of Management in Manila who has held senior posts at the World Bank, said policymakers for the most part do not yet incorporate climate effects into their preparedness efforts. “On the one side, there needs to be climate adaptation efforts, such as relocating people from highly exposed coastal regions or building better disaster preparedness that would withstand extreme hurricanes,” Thomas said. “Equally, there is a strong case for stepping up climate change mitigation in decarbonizing their economies.” Thomas said the findings of an “unmistakable causal link between carbon emissions and more intense floods and storms come at a crucial time,” as forest fires burn through Australia and floods and powerful storms hit the US and Europe. He said countries like Thailand, which saw massive flooding events that killed hundreds and affected millions in 2011, could not handle twice as many catastrophes each year. He said they need to conduct stress tests to understand what they can withstand. The study examined how disasters have increased as greenhouse gases have accumulated in the atmosphere over 60 years. It then projected that same trend into the future and considered how much a continued increase in floods and storms would affect regions based on how populous they are and whether residents are financially secure and prepared for disasters. The research used an economic approach, rather than relying on climate modeling – which uses computers to calculate likely outcomes based on a range of inputs. The journal publishing the study is based in Manila and not widely known. The authors said they first attempted to publish their work in the well-read journal Science. Don Wuebbles, a professor of atmosphere sciences at the University of Illinois who worked on the 2018 US National Climate Assessment, said the study might be underestimating future disasters by assuming disasters will continue to increase at the current rate. He said he appreciated that the researchers considered population growth and density but that he was “not sure they adequately considered the changes in climate for the future”. Ramón López, the lead author of the study who is a professor at the University of Chile, acknowledged the methods used might not account for the likelihood that severe events will increase at a faster rate than we have seen in the past."

It was with sadness and surprise that I learned today that Bombers Baja Grill off East Avenue has closed their doors forever. They served their last Mexican food ordnance today, 12/15/06.
Bombers was known for the biggest burrito ever made (at least in Chico). There was the “missile”, the “bomber” and the “atomic bomb” which between the habeneros, beans, and the calories, was a nearly 2 pound explosive combination.
I’m not sure where they got the idea to mix bombs and burritos, but here is an early picture from the experimental days of the restaurant where they were loading planes at the Chico Army Air Base (now the Chico Airport).

Bombers was an original, so original that those corporate franchisers at Chipotle knocked off the idea I think. But unlike Chipotle, which has food served in prison cafeteria style with steel and glass ambience, Bombers food was great, and the ambience had history you could feel.
I suppose it was only a matter of time though, they had a terrible location, and competition was springing up around them. They were also nearly invisible, which goes to show it pays to advertise.
I’ll miss Bombers.

Northern Europe and the Arctic show signs of winter cooling over the past decades. Could the global warming theory be in for an upset?
Looking at January data over the northern Europe, we see no real warming trend for the month, according to data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).
When plotting mean January temperatures for Norway for stations where data are available since 1988, we see that 7 of 11 stations show a cooling trend since 1988, despite rising CO2:

Data: JMA. 
January cooling in Finland
The story is the same in Finland, a country that stretches into the Arctic:

All stations with data going back to 1988 show a cooling trend in Finland for the month of January. Data: JMA
Ireland cooling more than warming

In Ireland, situated in the North Atlantic, we also see signs of cooling mid winters. warming has been AWOL for some time now:

 
In Ireland 4 of 6 stations with data going back to 1988 show a cooling trend for the month of January. Data: JMA
Arctic sea ice rebound
Next we move to the Arctic. This year’s winter is seeing an impressive rebound in sea ice, tweets meteorologist Chris Martz, reaching the 3rd highest level in 15 years:

Arctic sea ice extent is currently 3rd highest in the last 15 years, the only years higher are 2008 and 2009. It just surpassed 2013 and is about to pass 2004 within the next day or two. It isn't too far behind 2009 either. This isn't good news for the narrative, I will say that. pic.twitter.com/RyCRMnI8tK

“Dramatic recovery” for Arctic sea ice

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate alarmist scientists refuted
Distinguished climate expert Roger Pielke Jr. tweeted on recent findings contradicting alarmist claims that tropical storms have slowed down (thus stick around longer and wreak more devastation) or are more frequent and intense.
First, lets look at frequency and intensity.
No detected upward intensity/frequency trend at all
In an article appearing at Forbes, Pielke writes together with atmospheric scientist Dr. Ryan Maue how they and University of North Carolina-Wilmington professor Jessica Weinkle used datasets available around the world on tropical cyclones to create a historical record of storms of at least hurricane strength that made landfall.
Fifty years of global landfalls of tropical cyclones of hurricane strength, based on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale, were analyzed.
According to the findings published earlier here:
The analysis does not indicate significant long-period global or individual basin trends in the frequency or intensity of landfalling TCs of minor or major hurricane strength. The evidence in this study provides strong support for the conclusion that increasing damage around the world during the past several decades can be explained entirely by increasing wealth in locations prone to TC landfalls, which adds confidence to the fidelity of economic normalization analyses.”
Shown below is an updated chart from the Pielke et al 2012 paper, which was extended to 2019. It shows global tropical cyclone landfalls at hurricane strength from 1970 to 2019:

According to Pielke and Maue at FORBES: “There are a lot of ups and downs in the data, but no obvious trends.”
Tropical storm translation speeds have not slowed down
Pielke also tweeted about a new study appearing in Nature here. The University of Colorado scientist commented:
He added that the claim that tropical cyclones have now slowed down are “supported by both observations and modeling” and that “there is no reason to expect a slowdown” in the future:

And, from this study under RCP8.5 (!!) there would be no reason to expect a slowdown in hurricane translation speeds in the future pic.twitter.com/RE1aG9OCBC

The distinguished professor also says it’s: “Time to retire the notion that hurricanes are slowing down (much less the attribution claims).”

"Seven new species of miniaturised frogs have been found in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. Among the smallest vertebrates on the planet, these colourful creatures can fit comfortably on a human thumbnail.  To understand just how tiny these frogs are, consider this: the largest living vertebrate is the blue whale, measuring around 26m, while the smallest was believed to be a fish (Paedocypris progenetica) with an adult size of 7.9-10.3mm.  Then two years ago a new species of miniature frog was described, and it was a record breaker. Paedophryne amauensis,  which lives on the island of New Guinea, only grows to an average size of just 7.7mm and is now considered the world’s smallest vertebrate.  The latest discoveries in Brazil, announced in the journal PeerJ, are slightly larger, at between 9 and 13mm. But they’re still tiny compared to pretty much anything else with a backbone.  The frogs belong to the genus Brachycephalus, sometimes labelled “pumpkin toads” due to the often bright orange skin of some members. They live only in permanently-foggy patches of mountainside in Brazil’s Atlantic rainforest known as “cloud forest”.  The first Bracycephalus species was described as early as 1824 but most of the currently recognised 21 species have only been discovered in the last 15 years. The recent finding of seven new species and the difficulty of exploring the inaccessible habitat in which these animals live, suggests the actual diversity in the genus is considerably higher. Most miniaturised frog species have simplified things as a consequence of their reduced size. They have fewer vertebrae than their larger relatives, and fewer skull elements. They also often have reduced numbers of digits; regular frogs generally have four fingers and five toes, whereas miniature frogs have just three and two respectively.   Miniaturised frogs share a number of ecological traits – they are found in wet tropical regions, primarily in forests, living near the ground in the moist leaf litter. This makes sense for such tiny amphibians. After all, their high surface-to-volume ratio makes them vulnerable to desiccation (drying out) and thus they are very sensitive to water loss.  Many, however, are not dependent on water for reproduction. In fact, some species entirely lack the larval tadpole stage typical of most frogs.  Females in these cases instead produce a small number of large eggs that develop directly into small independent froglets. Although this elimination of a tadpole stage may have paved the way for the exploitation of new niches and miniaturisation, the relationship between miniaturisation and terrestrial breeding is not well understood.  It is believed that miniaturisation has evolved independently at least 11 times in terrestrial frogs and species measuring less that 13mm include representatives from 5 families and 9 genera. The Atlantic cloud forests of Brazil have the sort of diverse and humid microclimates in which frogs thrive. The forests are home to more than 400 different species, around 8% of the world’s frog and toad species. The region’s frogs are noted for the extraordinary diversity in  reproductive modes,  In fact, they exhibit  27 different reproductive modes in total including, of course, the typical reproductive cycle characterised by aquatic eggs (or “frog spawn”) that develop into tadpoles that in turn metamorphose into four-legged frogs.  But in many other species, including several found in the cloud forests, eggs and/or tadpoles are partially or completely removed from water. For example, some frogs lay their eggs in foam nests that float on the surface of ponds or on water accumulated on plants. The eggs hatch into tadpoles that complete development in water.  The recently found species, and most of their closest relatives, have gone a step further and completely removed their eggs from water and in the process eliminated the tadpole stage completely.  Decimation of the Brazilian Atlantic forest is one of the most alarming and desperate conservation problems in the world. In the year 1500 at the beginning of European colonisation, the area covered by the forest was approximately 1,300,000 km2.  Today the forest has been reduced to 7.6% of its original extent and the remaining forest is still under severe anthropogenic pressure.  Deforestation causes areas to dry out and eliminates those species, like miniature frogs and toads that depend on humid forests in order to breed successfully. Of the frog and toad species occurring in cloud forest, 81% occur nowhere else on earth.  No doubt there are many other frog species in Brazil that have not yet been discovered. Sadly, given the current rate of destruction and species extinction, it is possible they never will be."
"Hopes of using Davos to forge a new international consensus to tackle poverty and the climate crisis have been thwarted by the decision of the World Bank president, David Malpass, to boycott the event. To the surprise of the other multilateral institutions, Malpass turned down his invitation to attend despite being in Europe this week for the UK government’s Africa investment summit in London. In the past, World Bank presidents have played a prominent role at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, taking the opportunity to make the case for concerted action to tackle global poverty. The heads of other major international organisations, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the UN, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Trade Organization and the International Labour Organisation, attended the Davos event. One source said Malpass’s decision not to attend the World Economic Forum reflected the Bank’s go-it-alone approach under his presidency. “He has effectively declared UDI [unilateral declaration of independence],” the source said. “We saw it at last year’s G7 summit in France. President [Emmanuel] Macron wanted a collective statement from the international organisations but Malpass vetoed it. He wouldn’t have the word multilateralism in the statement.” Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  A spokesman for the World Economic Forum said Malpass, who was Donald Trump’s nominee to head the World Bank, had been invited. The next two most senior officials at the Washington-based institution – Axel van Trotsenburg, the bank’s managing director, and Philippe Le Houérou, the head of the bank’s private sector arm, the International Finance Corporation – are also notable absentees from Davos. By a tradition that stretches back to the 1940s, the US chooses the head of the bank while the European nations pick the managing director of the IMF. Since taking over less than a year ago, Malpass’s prioritisation of programmes for individual countries has led to suspicions in other international bodies that the bank is in effect being run from the White House. “There is no attempt to reach out to other institutions to look for system-level policy coherence,” according to one official in Davos. Those more sympathetic to Malpass said he was a shy man who did not know how to do smalltalk and hated events such as Davos. A World Bank spokesman said: “The World Bank Group is focused squarely on efforts to alleviate poverty and boost living standards. We sent senior technical experts on climate and water to the World Economic Forum to participate in discussions on how to improve development outcomes in these priority areas. “World Bank Group president Malpass has just returned from the UK-Africa Investment Summit 2020, where he met with over 10 leaders of several African countries to discuss challenges they face. He also engaged with private-sector clients and partners on local currency financing, capital markets, green financing and country-specific reforms that could be made to unlock private investment in developing countries.”"
"A senior adviser to the federal government on threatened species has backed calls for the creation of a national scientific monitoring system after the bushfire crisis to help fix Australia’s “very uneven” record in protecting endangered wildlife. Helene Marsh, chair of the national threatened species scientific committee and an emeritus professor of environmental science at James Cook University, said the scale of the ecological tragedy had made Australians more aware of the risks facing the country’s unique animals and plants and provided an opportunity to improve conservation.  With fires still burning, scientists warn it is too early to have a clear picture of the devastation, but preliminary government data suggests more than 100 threatened animal and plant species have lost at least half their habitat and more than 300 have lost more than 10%. The impact on most species not currently listed as threatened is yet to be assessed. Birdlife Australia estimates nearly 80 birds have lost at least a third of the area in which they live, and that the superb lyrebird may have plunged from being a common to a threatened species. Marsh said the threatened species committee planned to review the decision-making process for officially listing species as vulnerable or worse within the constraints of existing national environment laws. She said the protection offered to species after they were listed should also be reconsidered as the existing model of recovery planning had not worked. Fewer than 40% of nationally threatened species have recovery plans in place. She said she was encouraged by the level of goodwill between federal and state governments, scientists and conservationists following the fires, including the response by Sussan Ley, the federal environment minister, who has set up and met with an expert scientific panel to advise on what needed to be done. The federal government has allocated $50m in wildlife recovery funding, with a promise of more to come, and officials from across fire affected areas are due to meet on Tuesday to continue work on a national response. Marsh said the creation of a national scientific monitoring facility, proposed by fire scientists David Bowman and Ross Bradstock to fill critical gaps in bushfire knowledge, made some sense. She said it could include wildlife surveys. “I’ve been quite concerned about the way we monitor our biodiversity in Australia, it’s a huge job, and I think if we are going to understand the impact of fires that is a very interesting idea that needs consideration,” she said. Given not everything could be monitored, she said there would need to be clear priorities that would likely be defined by the 12m hectare bushfires. But she said it was important to consider “biodiversity arks”, key areas that had avoided the fires, as well as burned country. Marsh said it should utilise technology, including remote sensing and drones, as well as on-ground field work by scientists, Indigenous rangers and possibly community groups and citizen scientists. “I do believe that the importance of monitoring the impact of the fires will be a catalyst for doing this work,” she said. “It is very important that it be well designed and scientifically robust.” While she backed the development of a national system, Marsh said monitoring the impact of the fires could not wait for a new system and needed to begin as soon as it was safe. An analysis by environment groups found the Coalition had cut funding for environmental programs, monitoring and staff by about 40% since being elected in 2013. Marsh said changes would be needed to the national environment laws, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity and Protection Act, which is being reviewed by businessman Graeme Samuel. Asked how successful the laws had been, she said the government’s state of the environment report, which among other things found climate change was altering the structure and function of Australia’s natural ecosystems and affecting heritage, economic activity and human wellbeing, “spoke for itself”. Marsh said the review of the laws should consider whether it was appropriate to adopt more advanced criteria used by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to assess whether an ecological community was threatened.  Government ministers including Ley last year stressed the review would focus on cutting “green tape”. Scientists have expressed hope it may now address the impact of the fires and what was needed to avoiding an extinction crisis that scientists said was worsening before the devastating fire season. Scientists last year said three native Australian species had become extinct in the past decade and another 17 could follow in the next 20 years. More than 1,800 Australian plants and animals are listed as threatened with extinction. Scientists warned in a letter to the government before the fires that this was likely to be an underestimate."
"Big mining firms in the Democratic Republic of Congo are worried. For the past decade they’ve made good money from the country’s huge reserves of cobalt, diamonds, gold and copper, and now the government wants to grab more of the action: a document leaked to Bloomberg reveals plans to raise royalties and profit taxes, and increase the state’s share in any new ventures. This is so-called “resource nationalism” in action, and the DRC is far from alone in seeking greater economic control of its natural resources. The state is back, the theory goes, and it’s taking on the multinational. From Scotland to Namibia, Zambia to Ecuador, resource rich nations throughout the world are rhetorically reclaiming gas, oil and minerals as their own. The trend is widely reported as the enemy of trade, investment and energy security alike. In the UK, for example, the Telegraph called it a “spectre” and government economists have labelled it as both a “threat” and “anti-competitive”. On the other side of the coin, governments argue they are simply ensuring foreign businesses don’t unfairly benefit from resource extraction. Take Zambia, for instance. The landlocked African nation is a major copper exporter yet most of the population still lives below the poverty line. After the government looked to crack down on tax avoidance by multinational mining firms, one senior politician defended the move: “The situation is win on one side – only the shareholders are winning; the people of Zambia are still in abject poverty”.  The question of whether resource nationalism really is something to be feared is therefore a whole lot more complicated than it would first seem, for the three following reasons. Governments, most prominently those of Sub-Saharan countries like Ghana, Sierra Leone, Guinea or Tanzania, have argued for huge tax hikes on mining, oil and gas contracts in the name of the “national interest”. However, move beyond the rhetorical strength of such statements and resource nationalism is less the enemy of big business than a cover for a business-as-usual bias towards the interests of neo-liberal, foreign investment.  In Tanzania for example, recent discoveries off the coast of East Africa have led to predictions that the region will become one of the world’s biggest exporters of natural gas. As a result, “nationalist” laws are currently being drafted which begin: “Natural resources found in Tanzania belong to the [Tanzanian] people”.  At the same time, however, a recently signed memorandum of understanding between the UK and Tanzania promises, according to former foreign secretary William Hague, to “offer significant opportunities for British businesses in the energy sector”. Indeed, BG Group, as well as Norway’s Statoil and other big players have already been granted licences. The state is striking back in rhetoric only; it is business that still holds the real power. Like a game of Risk, our idea of national control tends to be fixated on owning resources found within neatly defined borders. In today’s world however, this doesn’t make sense.  Better technology, modelling and visualisation techniques means extraction frontiers are constantly being moved further afield and deeper underground. Mines such as one in Mponeng, South Africa, can reach nearly 4km deep and have more than 230 miles of tunnels, all to mine a 30 inch wide seam of ore. This should complicate our understanding of the idea of resource nationalism. How, for example, do we make sense of competing, contemporary claims to the deep sea off Namibia or Papua New Guinea? Similarly, questions over resources and sovereignty might even make us ask who owns the moon? Finally, geopolitical debates over extraction rights in the Arctic provide further worrying evidence of the ways in which national and private interests are always in competition. In all cases, the physical and metaphorical boundaries of the nation state have to be questioned as law tries to keep pace with technological advancement. Whatever the context, resource nationalism makes its claims by promising a country’s citizens “fair” and equally-distributed access to its resources. However this fails to account for politics. Mining and oil contracts are often negotiated in secret. Protests against these deals can be suppressed through state sanctioned force, and “national” policies often marginalise groups based on account of gender, race or sexuality. It is precisely this sort of identity politics which sparked violence over sovereignty in Mtwara, Tanzania, where the region’s population claims that they are marginalised from a policy that favours the urban elite hundreds of miles away.  The “national interest” never means the same thing to everyone within a nation: different people place different values on nature and its resources. Brazil’s recent draft bill aiming to “nationalise” the Amazon is a good example – made at a governmental level, it doesn’t necessarily consider the views of indigenous communities. And the idea of the “national interest” can’t adequately describe this complexity. From “African” oil to “Scottish” gas, those that fear “resource nationalism” would do well to remember this and not overly simplify the debate."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s onslaught on its famed automotive and production industries appears to be taking an economic toll as the country pushes ahead to go green by phasing out internal combustion engines and coal power plants.
Recently we reported how electricity prices are again slated to increase this year, and thus will continue to make German power among the most expensive worldwide.
A wave of green activism has led to tighter regulations against the internal combustion engines and to a planned phase-out of coal-fired power plants.
Teetering on recession
Just recently German online business daily Handelsblatt reported here that there are “new concerns about an economic slump in Germany” as “surprisingly weak figures are fueling new worries about a downturn”.
“Horrible numbers”…a “disaster”
“Experts spoke of ‘horrible numbers’, a ‘disaster’. Industry, construction, and energy providers produced a full 3.5 percent less in December than in the previous month,” the Handelsblatt reports.

December production plummets 6.8%
The economic bloodbath was even worse in the production sector which “fell even more sharply, with output falling by 6.8 percent – the sharpest drop since the end of 2009,” writes the Handelsblatt. “Concerns are growing again that the German economy may be in more difficult waters than expected.”
For Germany, “2019 was not only the worst year for industrial orders since 2008, it was also the first time since 2002 that German order books shrank for two years in a row,” reports Yahoo here.
Massive automotive layoffs
The German auto sector has been hard hit. For example, car maker Opel recently announced 2,100 job cuts in Germany. Late last year Daimler, owner of Mercedes Benz, announced plans “to ax at least 10,000 jobs,” Volkswagen’s Audi said “it would slash up to 9,500 jobs or one in ten staff by 2025 and car suppliers Continental and Osram announced staff and cost cuts.”
The Financial Times reported today that Daimler suffered its “worst results in decade” and that its earnings “plunged 60% in 2019 amid ‘Dieselgate’ woes.” Daimler also “refused to deny reports” that an additional 5,000 jobs could be cut.
The Financial Times adds: “Daimler is being forced to spend heavily on electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids in order to avoid fines from Brussels for breaching new emissions regulations.”
Other reasons cited for the poor German economic results are the ongoing global trade disputes. Figures are expected to come under even greater pressure due to the spreading corona virus in China.

"The US and Europe have clashed over the threat posed by global heating as Donald Trump’s finance minister downplayed the risks of a climate crisis during the final session of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Steve Mnuchin, the US Treasury secretary, said the debate should be about “environmental issues” rather than climate change, that the costs were being over-estimated and that climate was only one of several concerns that needed to be discussed.  He reacted strongly after the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said it was vital to include climate risks into economic forecasts and Germany’s finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said his country was stepping up its fight to reduce the use of carbon. “We don’t know how to price these risks and so we are over-estimating the costs”, Mnuchin said. “If you want to put taxes on people go ahead and put a carbon tax. That is a tax on hardworking people.” Mnuchin said technology would provide the solution to reducing carbon emissions and that the costs of action would be lower in 10 years time. “Environmental issues have an impact on the economy but it is one of many important issues.” Departure from the Paris climate agreement In June 2017 Trump announced his plan to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement saying"" “I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris”. He claimed the agreement promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to keep global heating below 2C, unfairly disadvantaged the US and negatively impacted jobs and factories. Shrinking national monuments and animal protections In December 2017 Trump announced plans to slash the size of two national monuments in Utah. Bears Ears was cut from 1.5m acres to 228,784 acres and Grand Staircase-Escalante almost halved from approximately 2m acres to 1,006,341 acres – marking the biggest elimination of public lands protection in America’s history. In late 2018 the administration then announced plans to remove key provisions from the Endangered Species Act – prompting conservationists to warn it could put vulnerable plant and animal species in more danger. Rollback of the Clean Power Plan The Environmental Protection Agency is in the process of finalizing plans to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era rule intended to cut emissions from power plants and encourage them to move towards natural gas and renewable power. Cuts to clean water protections The Trump administration plans to remove protections from thousands of America’s streams and millions of acres of wetlands, which is feared will harm wildlife and enable pollution to enter drinking water. Currently, protected waterways provide drinking water to approximately 117 million people. More methane In September 2018, the Trump administration announced its plans to repeal rules that aim to restrict methane leaks on public and tribal lands. The Obama administration tried to cut leaks by forcing oil and gas companies to capture methane (a key gas involved in global heating), but Trump's Department of the Interior has branded the rule 'flawed' and 'unnecessarily burdensome on the private sector'. Miranda Bryant Mnuchin cited the Coronavirus health emergency, Iran’s nuclear ambitions and the possibility of oil prices hitting $120 (£92) a barrel, and the need to power development in poor countries as other problems that policy makers needed to be concerned about. “There are way too many people in the developing world who don’t have access to electricity. We need to create an environment where they have better lives,” he said. Mnuchin found himself in a minority of one on a panel that included the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, and the Bank of Japan governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, as well as Lagarde and Scholz. Georgieva said the investments that would be needed to transform economies could be the “silver bullet” that would lift the world economy from four lows: low productivity, low growth, low inflation and low interest rates. “We need to think of policies that are good for the economy, good for the environment and good for people” she said. Green investment could provide a use for the world’s big pool of unused savings. “Not everything is doom and gloom.” Lagarde said that pricing the cost of making the transition to a low carbon economy coupled with pressure on companies to disclose their exposure to climate crisis risk would persuade companies to move faster. The ECB head said that, according to the marketing industry, there were three things that made people move: sex, fear and greed. “I don’t want to talk about the first but the fear factor is there. Look at the complete disasters that are going on around the world.” Turning to greed, Lagarde said the recent announcement from Larry Fink, the executive director of BlackRock, that the world’s biggest asset manager was moving to sustainable investment was an indication that companies were starting to worry about the impact of the climate emergency on their bottom line. Scholz said Germany’s decision to pay out more than €40bn to coalmining regions and power companies to phase out coal plants was justified by the scale of the threat. “There is climate change and it will hurt us. It will have negative effects on the economy. Britain’s departure from the EU next week had not entirely lifted the threat from Brexit, Lagarde said, noting that the negotiations this year over the new EU-UK trading arrangement had the potential to cause trouble. “Brexit is a little bit less uncertain, but we still have that possible cliff edge in December of 2020. We don’t’ know exactly what the trade relationship will be. And it’s a big partner for the euro area, so that’s certainly a question mark.” Scholz expressed relief that there had not been a “hard Brexit” and predicted that Germany would not take an economic hit from Britain’s departure. “It will be more difficult for the UK because it needs its business model to be reorganised” Scholz said. He added that the City of London would be affected by Brexit. “I think we will find solutions”, Scholz said, while warning the UK that there might not be a “special, competitive advantage of being outside” the EU.

Today I had to do a round trip drive to San Jose to inspect some video transmission equipment and back to Chico all in a few hours. Coming back, I was in stop and go traffic coming across the Benicia-Martinez Bridge (which is being rebuilt)which carries I-680 across Suisun Bay and had a fair amount of time to look at the Ghost Fleet kept by the Navy there.
Officially known as the National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) they have all sorts of ships there including the WWII battleship USS Iowa, merchant ships, and an aircraft carrier. There are also some WWI steam ships there too, many in a state of decay.
I was reminded of a boat trip I took down the Delta a few years ago where I got up close and personal with these ships. Some were impressive, others downright spooky. I also remeber finding the crossing of the old Sacramento Northern Electric Railway which went all the way to Chico, and up the Esplande. I’ll tell that story another time.
In the meantime here are some pictures and links of the Ghost Fleet.

Several destroyers and merchant ships, plus a tug.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe leading media worldwide cranked up the volume when it spread the news of how a statement had been published in the journal BioScience. The statement was a collaboration of “over 11,000 from 153 nations”.
The Guardian, for example reported: “The world’s people face ‘untold suffering due to the climate crisis’ unless there are major transformations to global society.”
Like most major media outlets around the world, the Guardian handled the “statement” as if it were the final confirmation needed to finally end any further discussion and hesitation on rapidly moving to a new, transformed “global society”.

Slick sales job. Dr. Thomas Newsome falsely claiming over 11,000 “scientists” support the climate statement. Image cropped from video by University of Sydney. 
The statement more hoax than scientific declaration
Days later, after a more careful scrutiny of the list – which the media failed to carry out, it was uncovered that the list of signatories was a declaration of scientific and media sloppiness and deception. One of the signatories was even cartoon character “Mickey Mouse”. But it gets worse than that.
11,224 list analyzed by Japanese blogger
Since then Japanese climate science skeptic and blogger, Kirye, spent dozens of hours thoroughly compiling and evaluating the 11,224 signatories using an Excel spreadsheet. Her findings have added greater clarity and exposed the true extent of the once media ballyhooed statement now turned hoax.
Kirye’s spreadsheet here.
5 of 11,224 a “climate scientist”

Of the 11,224 signatories, JUST FIVE (5) claimed to be a “climate scientist”.
Only 4 were meteorologists.
A vast number did not even state PhD or professor as their professional title/discipline. Only 2,796 (24.9%) had “professor” in their title. 1,481 (13.2%) of the signatories stated some form of PhD, including PhD “candidate”.
A total of 1,021 had “doctor in their title, i.e. only 9.1%. Many in an unrelated field.
303 of the signatories listed no professional title at all!
34 names had to be discarded altogether because they were invalid.
New climate experts: nephrologists, philiologists, pharmacists!
The vast majority were active in fields totally unrelated to climate science, such as “philiogist”, psychologist, CEO, political scientist, pharmacist, medical doctor, primatologist, physiopathology of the mitochondria, sociologist, industrial systems, nanoscientist, genetics, nephrologist, economist. biotech engineer, foreign language teacher, etc.  In other words, it’s a list hyperinflated by unqualified climate activists. Others were affiliated with environmental activist groups.
“Disservice” to science …”blow to credibility”
Thie list and media handling were in fact so sloppy that it compelled German geologist and hjournalist Axel Bojanowski to write at Cicero here how the statement and list of signatories were “a disservice” to climate science and “a deep blow to the credibility of research (and the media), not only because the list of signatories has apparently been published without verification.”
“Mocks media quality control”
The former Der Spiegel science journalist added: “The fact that numerous representatives of environmental associations are among the signatories and many others without a professional title makes one doubt their scientific character” and that it “mocks” the “media’s quality control function.”

"For months leading into this bleakest of summers, all anyone out this way could talk about was the dry. It crunched underfoot, was carried on the furnace-blast of a breeze, dust and dry leaves rattling down the wide avenues and riverbanks of the once mighty Murray River like a premonition of loss. It was written in the furrowed brows of farmers poring over district forecasts like they were scripture – ethereal in their promise of deliverance or damnation. Dry as the bones, pronounced, beneath the hides of animals starving and stunned; landscape bleached as a fossil.  Flying into Sydney in early December as the fires ringing the city had just started to burn in earnest, I had a sense of something momentous and profound unfolding, although it still seemed like a distant crisis, one that was happening elsewhere, to other people. The smoke was so thick every aircraft coming in was instructed to land with full instrumentation, so we spent 40 minutes in a holding pattern over enormous fire fronts, swinging lazy circles over great billowing plumes of ember and soot. Walking across the tarmac from the turboprop, I glanced back over my shoulder at the blood orange sun, ash sprinkling from the amber sky. When speaking at an event that evening, I joked that back home we had no water but the air was clean. Go west, where the skies are blue. I left the stash of P2 masks I’d picked up, only half-seriously, on my way to the airport with a friend who said she was taking an Uber to meetings a block away because her asthma was so bad she couldn’t walk more than a few hundred metres. Even as I was going through the motions, paying lip service to the Anthropocene, it still seemed surreal, somehow. I got on to the plane and flew back over the Great Dividing Range, vast eucalypt tracts fizzing smoke, descending once again into the arid, but breathable, air of home. There was a certain sense of foreboding in the hills in the lead-up to Christmas, as though the kindling landscape was holding its breath. The smoke swirled in from hundreds of kilometres north and settled for the festive season. We ate under grey skies, the house shuttered and our heads aching from the fumes, nights punctuated by the kind of toddler asthma attacks that leave you wired until dawn. What if he stops breathing? Hard-earned pennies were pinched and scraped to install an air purifier in his room, and in the nursery too. We didn’t need to leave our beds to know what kind of day it would be. The ochre and rust of another hazy sunrise spilling through the blinds heralded more of the same. Asphyxia. Inertia. Well before it visited itself upon us, the taste was everywhere. Death. New year brought conflagration. The text messages began rolling in. Are you OK? Sure, why wouldn’t we be? Turn on the news. It’s a gut-churning thing to see the names of places you love, those territories of the self and heart, suddenly headlines in a story of unspeakable horror. A tornado of flame, generated by infernos of such ferocity they create their own weather, rolling a fire truck. An unborn child who will never know their father, only his sacrifice. As small communities, we are constellations of people and place, oriented and anchored by and to one another. Talmalmo, Jingellic, Walwa, Corryong are more than just names in a news broadcast or an emergency warning. They are home to our families, our patients, our colleagues, our friends. For the diverse nations who live and gather along the tributaries of the Murray, the Milawa Billa, there could not be a grief more piercing than watching centuries of colonial mismanagement culminate in this ultimate desecration of country, with totem and traditional routes, sacred and spiritual places pared to ash. We all know someone who has lost something; everything. Photos from friends of a wall of fire racing across paddocks, engulfing life as it was once known. Everything is gone. The scars on our landscape will heal, but will we? Instead of celebrating, we rang in the new decade listening to emergency broadcasts, refreshing the Country Fire Authority and Rural Fire Service feeds, and watching Australian Defence Force water tankers flying low over our house. People gathered, muted and pale, in their yards to watch the midnight fireworks a few blocks away as the southerly swept in, acrid with ash. Hours before the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, called his late-night press conference to announce an unprecedented state of disaster and wholesale evacuations of East Gippsland and the north-east, we’d glanced at each other uneasily as our phones had chirped, simultaneously, with an emergency text. You need to leave were the first four words. Surely we’ll be safe here, we said, images of what had played out in Mallacoota that week vivid in our minds. The closest bush was 2km away, the fire station on the corner. Still. The rule book appeared to have been torched. We’d been asking for years that the landlord clear the gutters; all it would take was an ember on the right sort of wind. Where would we go if it came to it? Should we pack a bag? If we had to leave everything behind, what would be essential to take? We laughed at ourselves as we had these conversations – the river would be safe, if we could drive. The showground, if we had to walk. We found the passports. There were other matters to consider as thousands of people from surrounding villages and communities streamed into town, towing caravans, horse floats, trailers crammed with all things practical and precious. The supermarkets began selling out of water, servos between here and more distant towns ran out of petrol. It seemed prepper paranoid, but we agreed I should go out and fill up the car and do a massive shop. Just in case. Venturing out into the eerie still of the morning at sunrise, it could have been winter, a mephitic fug enveloping the town like mist. By the time I came out of the supermarket, where the water shelves were stripped bare and the aisles were hazy, the smoke had rolled in so thick they had disabled the automatic doors and taped a sign over the glass. Auto doors closed due to smoke. Please use side doors. Above the blood bank the sun rose, sanguineous; soporific. The sports stadium down the street opened to evacuees, along with the showground. I’d never seen so many people in town, their apprehension as palpable as the baking heat. The outpouring of support for displaced and dispossessed families and for firefighters was astonishing. Within hours of the RFS issuing their daily list of required items for affected communities and crews, it would be filled. Traffic was banked up for kilometres along the bush blocks adjoining the RFS HQ, an operation of military precision marshalling locals and their stocked boots to the driveway to unload. Dozens of volunteers sorted goods on to pallets and into shipping containers for distribution to outlying communities where people were without power, water or food. Some had lost the roof over their heads, their world reduced to ash. A ute sat in the RFS driveway, its tray overflowing with fruit and vegetables, a pallet stacked with eskies dropped off the by the environment minister, Sussan Ley, alongside. We handed over half a dozen shopping bags, and a drawing by our three-year-old son for the fireys. A burly volunteer crouched down to shake his hand and pinned it up, pride of place, on the noticeboard. As we prepared to leave, a pensioner pulled up in a clapped-out Commodore, a plastic bag full of odds and ends proffered from the passenger seat. It isn’t much, I’m sorry. I blinked away tears. The day of the firestorm, 4 January, we hit a record-breaking 46C in town. Clumsy with foreboding, I stepped awkwardly off our back deck and broke my ankle, lying dazed and thirsty in the heat. While the worst of the winds swept across the firegrounds I was in hospital, nauseous with morphine and still gripping the “green whistle”, though it had long since been sucked empty. By sunrise, I was sober, but the air outside was so toxic that, propped up in bed with towels stuffed around the doors and windows, I still had to wear a mask. Our 10-month-old was so hoarse and distressed I gave her Ventolin; she isn’t asthmatic. The PM2.5 reading (something I had only a passing acquaintance with before this summer) climbed steadily throughout the day to almost 3,000 – 15 times the level considered hazardous – before the local monitoring station went offline for the best part of a day. It seemed symbolic of the cataclysm that had unfolded in the surrounding towns and valleys, where the skies were a filthy orange and visibility reduced to metres at best. Days stretched into another week of wheezing confinement, while the prime minister bleated on about Australia being the best country in the world to raise kids. I cried when, during one of those impromptu toddler confidences, my son told me that one day he’d be older than me. I cried because I wonder if he will. To live to be my age, he will have to make it to 2055, when climate change will have rendered much of the planet inhospitable to human life, driven mass extinctions of almost every kind of species, and unleashed civil unrest over resources like food and water on a scale at which there is no precedent in human history. Moreso than the anxiety or political fury of this summer, I have been gripped by an insurmountable grief for my children and the life I took for granted which they will never be able to share. In a matter of days, 9 January, there was another evacuation order, more fires. Several straddling state borders joined up to become a “megablaze”, terminology I’d never had need for before this grim new decade. Millions of hectares of pristine national park went up, places as familiar to me as laboured breath. The roof of Australia aflame, the Alps snowy at the height of summer, with ash. As ever-increasing tracts of Mount Buffalo burned we could, on a rare clear evening, see the great fungating shadow of a pyrocumulonimbus cloud looming over the horizon, a sign that what raged below was so intense it was generating its own weather. There are many images that will come to define this summer: smog settling so thick over Sydney Harbour its iconic landmarks were obscured, the starved and scorched koalas of Kangaroo Island, a masked schoolkid steering a tinny offshore as Mallacoota was devoured by an avaricious inferno, Scott Morrison hanging a shaka on the Waikiki waterfront. But if you’ve lived in a fire zone, the pyroCb or cumulonimbus flammagenitus will stay with you forever, as a harbinger of the Anthropocene. Ignis aurum probat. Ten days into the decade, the alerts sounded uncomfortably close to home. A grass fire on the Beechworth-Wodonga road – a route we would have travelled more times than you could count – was suddenly racing out of control towards the semi-rural outskirts of Wodonga, our sister city, home to some 40,000 people, just across the Murray River. As quickly as it had started, fuelled by a wild southerly change with lightning and 100km/h winds, the blaze was declared emergency level. You are in danger. Act now to protect yourself. It is too late to leave. The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately. Those in the area who could evacuate made their way into town to shelter at The Cube performance space; others hosed down their roofs and gutters, watching anxiously as water bombing aircraft flew sorties overhead, trying to contain the advancing flames. Defence crews were mobilised as the blaze spotted towards a string of barracks and bases where hundreds of unfortunate people displaced earlier in the week had taken refuge. In the next valley, residents of a relatively new development known as White Box Rise were urged to get out. In among the frantic messages from loved ones as we again hit the headlines was a text from friends who had just bought in White Box and had been scheduled to return from Melbourne that week from their Christmas holiday with their newborn baby. We’d convinced them to delay due to the smoke. This is the other side of our hill, they captioned a screenshot of the emergency alert. Sweet Jesus. Our house. As night fell, the winds eased, and a smattering of rain brought some much-needed reprieve. Evacuees were, in waves, permitted to return home. There was a nagging, contradictory sense that the gun was never really loaded, but we’d dodged a bullet nonetheless. Reams have already been written about this grim summer; an unwelcome but imperative clarion call to the millions of us sleepwalking toward the abyss. Just two months ago I sat in a climate-themed medical conference where they discussed the need for field hospitals, colocation of emergency triage and primary care, new ways of doing business when the climate rendered business-as-usual obsolete. The fires were burning, even then, and Prof David Bowman warned us that this was a season like no other. Yet it all seemed so abstract; so rhetorical. The climate emergency was something that was happening elsewhere, to other people. Until it wasn’t. Andrews has described this as a summer of firsts; there’s been so many now they seem to have lost impact as time goes on. But there are snapshots of this season I won’t forget. Toddlers receiving commendations for bravery on behalf of fathers who will miss a lifetime of milestones. Stepping on to the tarmac under that ominous, orange sky, the scarcest smattering of ash on the breeze. Evacuation sirens; smoke so dense it cancels out the sun. The fear in my son’s eyes as he struggled to catch a breath. Thousands upon thousands of livestock charred and scattered by the road; millions upon millions of native animals – likely entire species – incinerated. We need new words for collective grief of this scale. There are political observations to be made, and urgent agendas to be advanced if – and indeed, it feels so precariously like an if – we wish to survive. Already, the goalposts have shifted to “the new normal”; summers spent indoors lest the air chokes us all, Christmas under slate and noxious skies, evacuation orders covering ever-larger concentric circles until, at last, there is nothing left to burn and nowhere left to run. If we are to take anything from this season of solastalgia, it must be the immense grace and goodwill, courage and conviction that abides in our communities and comes to the fore when it’s needed most. As our climate becomes more hostile, perhaps the single greatest risk is that, in tandem, so do we. The learned helplessness of neoliberalism not only invites us to believe that we, as individuals, are powerless, it depends on it. But we’ve seen something else entirely forged in these long months: leadership from the grassroots, the ability of communities to rally around one another not thanks to political action but in spite of it. Ignis aurum probat, miseria fortes viros. As gold is tempered by fire, so strong men are tempered by suffering. Collectively, our strength is infinite. Now, more than ever, we must live as testament to that. • Amy Coopes is a Croakey editor, journalist and medical student • This piece was originally published in Croakey and is republished with permission.

"SpongeBob SquarePants, perhaps the world’s most famous sponge, is the star of his own cartoon show set in the ocean-floor city of “Bikini Bottom”. In the real world, however, sponges are often perceived as playing only a supporting role to the real reef stars: corals. But new research, published in PeerJ, has once again highlighted sponge-power. These squishy creatures, it is feared, might take over coral reefs if not kept in check by sponge-eating fishes – and overfishing is removing their natural predators. A team of researchers from the University of North Carolina assessed coral reefs in 12 Caribbean countries. They compared sites where fish stocks are depleted due to intensive fishing with more protected sites where fish still exist in greater numbers. Twice as many coral colonies were found in contact with sponges at the overfished sites.  This matters because sponges have been shown to have the potential to kill corals, and corals are among the key organisms in any reef. Their calcium carbonate skeletons lay the foundation of precious and immensely complex ecosystems on which about a third of all marine species depend on. So any threat should be taken very seriously. Increased exposure to often toxic sponges raises concerns that sponges might be able to out-compete corals.  Many sponges contain a complex cocktail of toxic and distasteful compounds, chemical weapons accumulated to defend themselves from being eaten or overgrown by other organisms. This makes them interesting sources for potential new drugs. But in the absence of predators, it appears this arsenal can be also used in an offensive manner against corals to prepare the ground for their own expansion.  Sponges usually adopt a hidden lifestyle underneath boulders and in a reef’s cracks and crevices, at least partly to avoid predators such as parrotfish and angelfish. In fact, previous research using the same endoscopic techniques surgeons use to look inside human bodies demonstrated that the majority of sponge biomass lives not on top of a reef but within it. Apart from these species that make use of existing hollows, the not so dull “boring sponges” even produce acids 
to drill themselves a home.  They aren’t too worried about where they set up their residence, as long as it consists of chalky material. Boring sponges can therefore be not only found in limestone rock but also in various types of animal and plant shells and skeletons, including those of live and dead corals. This is of critical concern since it renders the coral colonies more fragile and vulnerable to damage by strong waves.  There are exceptions to the rule of course, and a number of sponge species form erect structures on the seabed. One of these, the majestic barrel sponge, can grow to a diameter of nearly two metres and can live for up to 2,000 years. Sponges play a vital role in the functioning of coral reef ecosystems. They can filter large quantities of water through their many pores and then squirt it through their bodies, removing tiny plankton creatures and organic compounds for food. It is this porousness which gives sponges the natural and much-appreciated ability to retain large amounts of liquid for cleaning purposes. The waste products of the sponge diet contain nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, which are dearly needed by the bacterial and plant life of the usually nutrient-deprived reefs. Sponges have also found another way of ridding themselves of their waste: by rapidly replicating cells and shedding them in large numbers. These cells are either eaten by other organisms or decompose, again, releasing valuable nitrogen and phosphorous.  Through these mechanisms sponges can supply nutrients that might otherwise not be accessible to the reef creatures or would be lost to the oceans surrounding the reefs. This nutrient cycle has been termed “sponge loop” and helps to explain the Darwin Paradox – the puzzling observation, first noted by the man himself, that coral reefs form these amazingly productive oases in the midst of a nutrient-poor ocean desert. You can have too much of a good thing, however. Excess nutrients introduced in coral reefs through fertilisers, sewage dumping or stirring-up of sediments have the potential to severely disturb their vulnerable ecological balance. Apart from rendering corals more susceptible to bleaching, more nutrients stimulate the production of plankton thereby increasing the availability of food for sponges.  As a consequence, corals may suffer from destabilisation of their skeletons or the reef framework due to boring sponges or potentially increased competition for space, in particular if the affected reefs are overfished.  In the Caribbean, coral cover – the proportion of reef that is live coral rather than sponge or algae – has declined dramatically from more than 50% in the 1970s to around 10% today. Overfishing and die-outs of herbivores, eutrophication and pollution, invasive species, diseases and climate change have taken a heavy toll on these once flourishing reefs.  Despite the differences in sponge-coral contacts reported in the latest study, the coral cover at these overfished and less fished sites hasn’t differed substantially. The battle between sponges and corals is only just unfolding. It is awful to see coral in such a bad state – after all who doesn’t love the image of a pristine, colourful reef, full of amazing fish? – but sponges aren’t the real villains of this recent reef drama. As overfishing has removed many of their natural enemies it appears sponges have been handed an unfair edge over the corals. Once again, fingers point in the direction of us humans."

WISN-TV
in Milwaukee…TV News Truck Breaks Through Ice:

Even though the temperatures have fallen, the ice on many bodies of water is
not thick enough to support vehicles.
A crew for a local television station drove its news truck onto a channel to
Big Muskeo Lake Sunday and broke through the ice. Crews for WDJT-TV in Milwaukee
were reportedly shooting a story about thin ice when the truck fell through.
The driver reportedly mistook the channel for a road when the accident happened.
The truck was approximately 150 yards off the boat launch, according to a
release issued by the City of Muskego Police Department.
The driver of the truck was the sole occupant and was able to get out without
injury, but the truck remains partially submerged.

Moderators note: Having worked in TV news myself, I’m
not that surprised. Often the only thing on reporters and producers minds is the
story deadline. Caution and common sense sometimes take a backseat in the news van.

"We’re in the midst of fevered discussions about communications and security. Cybertarian campaigners want to stop collusion between corporations and governments to intercept citizen chat; attention-grabbing adolescents at Anonymous want to disrupt murderers who dislike mockery of their principal prophet and the gilt-edged grown-ups in national security services want to listen in on plans to revenge such blasphemy. But away from these dramatic debates over speech, privacy, the state, a less exciting conversation is underway, beyond the third-sector moralism of cybertarians, the attention span of adolescents, and the Olympian speechifying of spymasters. This conversation touches on security and communications in a less spectacular way. Electronic waste (or e-waste) is the largest source of materials left in municipal dumps around the world.  A high proportion of it is derived from the gadgets you are reading this article on: phones, tablets, and computers, which quickly move from being vital sources of everyday life to discarded garbage once an upgrade becomes available. Where did that old fat-screen analogue television go when it was replaced by the slim, flat-screen digital version? Where are those phones you threw out? A vast proportion of these deadly gizmos, with their lethal cocktails of carcinogenic gases and chemicals, end up being unsafely recycled by the poorest of the poor, the most vulnerable of the vulnerable. Pre-teen girls in Chinese and Indian villages are expert at the dangerous work of extracting recyclable minerals from our detritus. Increasingly, of course, the trade in e-waste is domestic. Asian middle classes are booming and as keen as their so-called “Western” counterparts to fetishise the fresh and new by dumping the toxic and the old in the villages and bodies of the desperate. The result is horrendous disease, a poisoned water table, and drifting air pollution. Because this trade occurs in what is politely known as “the informal sector” – translation, where there are no taxes, benefits, health and safety protections, or retirement payments – it is difficult to trace the precise dimensions of e-waste. But the International Telecommunication Union, a technology booster if ever there was one, acknowledges the existence of a problem as annual amounts reach a reported 53 million metric tonnes (2013), with an additional 67 million metric tonnes sold in various forms. And after recycling? E-waste ends up in some very interesting places. Two years ago, the Pentagon and the US Senate Armed Services Committee reported that vital components of the nation’s military hardware routinely include “counterfeit” electronic materials, from China (70%), the UK (11%), and Canada (9%). The Pentagon defines counterfeiting as recycled materials wrongly sold as new, or misuse of others’ intellectual property. Often these counterfeits come from recycled e-waste – the committee estimated more than a million counterfeit parts were in service in US planes. It’s no surprise much of this can be traced back to China, where counterfeiting operates at an industrial level, with factory floors populated by thousands of workers dedicated to the task. Take the Boeing P8 Poseidon, a plane used by the US Navy to drop torpedoes, depth charges and carry surveillance equipment. In 2011, Boeing reported it had discovered a faulty ice detection system in the aircraft, according to the senate committee report. Further investigation revealed the part was previously used, and made to appear new.  After tracing the parts through companies in California and then Florida, it turned out the ice detection equipment had originally come from “an affiliate of A Access Electronics in Shenzhen, China.” And before that? Who knows? Investigators from the senate committee wanted to find out but were denied Chinese visas. Now the story is in the news again. Forbes has just published a column on the topic as did National Defense magazine, an obvious mouthpiece for the military industrial complex. The principal beneficiaries of the complex are warning that this malfeasance continues unabated, and at a massive level, despite 2012 legislation designed to quell it. The senate committee report refers to “risks to national security and the safety of US military personnel” posed by this trade in counterfeit e-waste. There is no mention of the risks posed to people all over the world by the United States’ very use of matériel, of course. But the fact that e-waste is on the agenda in such powerful quarters bodes well for real reform towards managing it properly. The technology is available to recycle our electronic pleasures in a much safer way than is generally the case. In many instances, laws exist to mandate that. What we need is proper use of the technology and serious enforcement of such legislation. But beyond that, we need an end to the built-in obsolescence and advertising-fuelled clamour surrounding innovation. It would help if the cybertarians, adolescents, and spies were able to let go of their shared obsessions for a moment and question the very devices and systems on which they rely for their self-anointed roles. Then they might recognise that the much-vaunted internet of things is also and equally an internet of junk."
"São Paulo’s ongoing water crisis has left many of the city’s 20m or more residents without tap water for days on end. Brazil’s largest metropolis is into its third month of water rationing, and some citizens have even taken to drilling through their basements to reach groundwater. Most commentators agree that the crisis is to blame on multiple factors, but few have questioned the role of the water company in charge: Sabesp. The utility, responsible for water and waste in São Paulo and the surrounding state of the same name, has clearly failed its public service remit. Yet, it’s not even clear whether public service is the highest priority for part-privatised Sabesp, whose directors have just awarded themselves bumper bonuses despite millions of their customers going thirsty. São Paulo’s water will go from crisis to crisis so long as Sabesp prioritises profits over long-term investment. Clearly there are human-induced environmental factors at play: climate change, deforestation of the Amazon, pollution, as well as overconsumption. The pressures we put on nature are likely to increase water shortages worldwide, perhaps leading to conflicts and wars. However, at the same time, there have always been droughts. Historical records going back hundreds of years show how cities and regions have struggled and often coped with extreme water shortages. So, periods without much rain are nothing new. But if that is the case, shouldn’t it be the responsibility of water utilities to plan for such events, putting in place contingency measures to manage possible water shortages? São Paulo’s extraordinary growth in recent decades has overloaded the Cantareira, the city’s water supply system. But the rapid increase in water usage was hardly a surprise; it’s something that could have been managed and planned for. Sabesp has failed to do exactly that. One of the world’s largest water utilities, Sabesp was founded as a public institution in 1973. Since part-privatisation in 1994 the state of São Paulo has maintained at least half of the company’s voting capital, though shares are also traded on the New York and São Paulo stock exchanges. While The Economist and others were keen to point out that Sabesp is “majority-owned by the state government”, this doesn’t tell the whole story. The utility is neither a public organisation concerned with providing a public service, nor a private company facing competition from other companies and controlled by regulatory agencies. Just like the “natural monopolies” enjoyed by water companies in the UK, Sabesp has a publicly guaranteed monopoly, yet its profits are part-privatised – earlier this year it paid out R$252m (US$83m) in dividends. São Paulo’s water is just one of many public utilities that have been privatised throughout the world over the past few decades. Governments have followed the ideological belief that, in order to conserve and manage water properly, it is essential to put a price on what used to be a public good. In 1992, the UN adopted the Dublin Principles, declaring that putting a price on water and establishing a “participatory approach” – which is about involving users, planners and policy-makers at all levels – was the best way to reach a sustainable and equitable governance of water. The principles were quickly adopted by Brazil’s government, and implemented first in, you guessed it, São Paulo. The Dublin Principles call for the establishment of “basin committees”, formed of government, water companies, local residents and civil society. These committees are supposed to be responsible for deciding on water use in a particular watershed. Yet, 23 years after this mechanism was supposedly implemented by Law 7663 in São Paulo – and after 17 years of a similar rule at the national level – we still do not know who participated in these committees. On paper these committees exist, but in practice they are not empowered by state structures. Dysfunctional governance in São Paulo state has left the part-privatised utility, Sabesp, to mainly follow the principles of the market and the interests of its private shareholders. This inevitably skews its strategy towards the short-term. When deciding whether to make the necessary investments to prepare for possible water shortages, Sabesp has had to choose whether to safeguard the public supply or increase the value of its shares. The company did invest US$4 billion from 2005-2013, but that is still not enough. Many of the necessary measures to prevent the current crisis – such as upgrading the Cantareira system – were not implemented because they would be unprofitable to Sabesp’s shareholders . The company’s lack of transparency since the crisis kicked off highlights its planning failure. For many months Sabesp denied that water was being rationed. Then state governor, Geraldo Alckmin, acknowledged that there was lack of water, but said they were “isolated and private” cases. Then a bonus offered to those who economised water in their daily use, later turned into a fine for those who “waste” water. The most essential resource of all has now become a struggle in São Paulo. Yet, ever deepening inequality has turned a water crisis into a social and economic crisis – communities on the periphery of the city and slums were inevitably the first to have their water rationed. Responsibility for this crisis lies with Sabesp and two decades of running water supply as a for-profit service. It is a failure of public-private partnership. As climate change and other environmental factors make water crises more likely, we better rethink the way water is managed worldwide."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLest anyone has wondered why the climate movement has shifted its focus over to children, it is because too many adults just refused to buy into the climate-Armageddon hoax.
It’s a fact: Children are very easy to manipulate and deceive.
Children – and adults with stunted intellectual development – are much easier to convince than adults who have been around the block of life a few times. Children are naive, inexperienced, lack insight and highly impressionable. This makes them vulnerable and thus really easy targets for climate radicals.
88 victims of sadism
Nothing illustrates this better than a recent story appearing in the Daily Mail here, where it is reported how a German sadist, via Skype, was able to successfully convince 88 young women to give themselves potentially lethal 230-volt shocks!
If one sicko is able to convince people to practically electrocute themselves, then imagine how easy it is for the media/organized activists to convince kids a climate doomsday is coming. It’s all based on the same bloody. The approach is the same in both cases:
1) First there’s an offender who derives pleasure through power over the victims
2) The offender claims to have great authority
3) The offender requests that their victims submit and obey
4) The offender claims it’s for a good cause
5) The offender promises the victims great reward for submitting
6) disaster results
1. Pleasure from sense of power
Just as the German ‘socket sadist’ derived his pleasure from the sense of power over his victims and sexual gratification, the climate radicals derive their pleasure from the control they have over today’s children.
2. Claim of authority
While the German socket sadist claimed to be a researcher conducting an experiment that would advance science and thus the common public good, climate radicals falsely claim to possess the scientific truth, and that they have everything under control and can be trusted.


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




“The victims believed he was a scientist and there was no danger to them to carry out the experiment, that’s why they agreed,” the Daily Mail quoted prosecutors. “But he appeared so serious,” one victim later said.
The socket sadist refused to be challenged. If his victims resisted cooperating, then they were made to feel guilty and inadequate. With climate radicals, they label dissenters as deniers and villains. The climate radicals also do not tolerate any questioning or dissent.
3, Request to sacrifice
The German socket sadist asked his young female victims to hurt themselves – all in the name of science. The climate radicals demand that their followers collectively subject themselves to hardship and accept going without the amenities we enjoy, while exempting themselves.
4. Do it for a good cause
The socket sadist promised his victims it was in service of science, a good cause they could feel good about. Likewise, the climate radicals falsely promise kids they will see a much brighter future-  but only if they submit and do as they’re told. It’ll save the planet if they do, they are told.
5. False promises of reward
While the “socket sadist” allegedly made false promises of money (up to €3,000) to his victims and assured them they were participating in the noble cause of advancing science, the highly organized and authoritarian climate radicals promise the kids that if they do as they are told, the planet will be rescued, will become a green paradise, and peace will reign.
And they won’t have to school on Fridays.
6. Will turn into a mess
Just as the socket sadist case turned into a disaster, so will the extreme climate movement of zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Ironically, defense lawyers for the socket sadist, Klaus W Spiegel and Matthias Bohn, are now claiming their client had diminished responsibility for his actions as he suffers from Asperger Syndrome and autism. Sound familiar?

Our lovely model above appears to be boarding up her cabana in preparation for the next hurricane.
Nails, as inventions go, have a legacy back to before the time of Christ. And after two milliennia, they are still pretty much the same; a piece of iron wire with a wider top to be driven into two pieces of wood to hold it together.
Sure there’s been improvements in steel, in manufacturing, and in making better hammers, but the nail itself hasn’t really changed much.
So its with a surprise that I read in Popular Science that a new nail became one of the ineventions lauded in 2006. Popular Science is naming its Best of What’s New.
It’s not your average nail though, the HurriQuake nail spent six years in development. Its designed to help building withstand hurricane force winds (over 71MPH) and earthquakes that rock wood structures apart. I expect our own local best hardware store, Colliers, to start carrying this sometime soon…I mean they HAVE to, they have EVERYTHING.
From the article:
“As the Bostitch team tweaked the head-to-shank ratio, Sutt and metallurgist Tom Stall worked on optimizing high-carbon alloys, trying to find the highest-strength trade-off between stiffness and pliability — the key to preventing snapped nails. ‘Meanwhile,’ Sutt says, ‘we were focusing on how to keep the nail from pulling out.’ The team machined a series of barbed rings that extend up the nail’s shaft from its point, experimenting with the size and placement of the barbs. ‘You want the rings to have maximum holding power,’ he says, ‘but if they go up too high, it creates a more brittle shank that shears more easily.'”
Now if they can just invent the thumb-proof hammer, we’ll really have something.
I guess you could file this invention under “global warming” as the company references the recent increased frequency of hurricanes as an impetus to the invention. Personally I think the linkage between global warming and hurricanes doesn’t wash, as do many hurricane experts like Dr Neil Frank, former director of the National Hurricane Center and Dr. William Gray, a world renowned predictor of hurricanes. The 2006 hurricane season ends December 1st, and so far this year has been an.. er. wash out in big hurricanes with only 7 in the Atlantic, compared to 2005’s hurricane season with 7 major storms, including hurricane Katrina. Katrina became the media poster child for the global warming to hurricane link, among other things.

The new US stealth fighter, the F-22 Raptor, was deployed for the first time to Asia earlier this month. On Feb. 11, twelve Raptors flying from Hawaii to Japan were forced to turn back when a software glitch crashed all of the F-22s’ on-board computers as they crossed the international date line.
The delay in arrival in Japan was previously reported, with rumors of problems with the software. CNN reported that every fighter completely lost all navigation and communications when they crossed the International Date Line. They reportedly had to turn around and follow their tankers by visual contact back to Hawaii. According to the CNN story, if they had not been with their tankers, or the weather had been bad, this would have been serious.
I have to think there’s going to come a time when wars are fought by warrior hackers, each trying to take down the other sides computers. Or there may come a day when an airliner falls out of the sky because software failed on all the redundant systems. I sure hope not.

News from Antarctica: how’s the ice?
By Kalte Sonne
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
The ice in Antarctica, how is it doing? Is it melting, is it growing? In the following we wishto present the latest literature on the subject. There is a lot to report.
Fasten your seat belt, there’s a lot to cover.
Let’s start with the temperature development because along with snowfall, this is the most important control factor for Antarctic inland ice.
At NoTricksZone, Kirye shows ten coastal stations of Antarctica. None have been warming over the past 10 years. An example followws

And here’s the temperature development of the entire Antarctic according to UAH and RSS satellite measurements (from Climate4You, via NoTricksZone):



According to Clem et al. 2018, East Antarctica has cooled over the last 60 years, while West Antarctica has warmed. The authors establish a connection with the SAM ocean cycle, the Southern Annular Mode. Euan Mearns also deals with the temperature development of Antarctica during the last decades.
Increased ice
Based on height and gravity field measurements by satellite and GPS measurements on the ground, Martin-Español et al. 2017 determined an increase in ice mass in the East Antarctic and a reduction in ice mass in the (much smaller) West Antarctic for the interval 2003-2013. NASA researcher Jay Zwally also interprets an increase in the East Antarctic ice mass. However, a paper announced in mid-2018 still seems to be stuck in review…
Will the ice of East Antarctica be dragged along by the melting West Antarctic at some point in the melting vortex? No, this will not happen, Indiana University said in a press release of 2017:
New study validates East Antarctic ice sheet should remain stable even if western ice sheet melts
A new study from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis validates that the central core of the East Antarctic ice sheet should remain stable even if the West Antarctic ice sheet melts. The study’s findings are significant, given that some predict the West Antarctic ice sheet could melt quickly due to global warming.
If the East Antarctic ice sheet, which is 10 times larger than the western ice sheet, melted completely, it would cause sea levels worldwide to rise almost 200 feet, according to Kathy Licht, an associate professor in the Department of Earth Sciences in the School of Science at IUPUI. Licht led a research team into the Transarctic Mountains in search of physical evidence that would verify whether a long-standing idea was still true: The East Antarctic ice sheet is stable.
The East Antarctic ice sheet has long been considered relatively stable because most of the ice sheet was thought to rest on bedrock above sea level, making it less susceptible to changes in climate. However, recent studies show widespread water beneath it and higher melt potential from impinging ocean water. The West Antarctic ice sheet is a marine-based ice sheet that is mostly grounded below sea level, which makes it much more susceptible to changes in sea level and variations in ocean temperature. „Some people have recently found that the East Antarctic ice sheet isn’t as stable as once thought, particularly near some parts of the coast,“ Licht said.
Recent studies have determined that the perimeter of the East Antarctic ice sheet is potentially more sensitive and that the ice may have retreated and advanced much more dynamically than was thought, Licht said. „We believed this was a good time to look to the interior of the ice sheet. We didn’t really know what had happened there,“ Licht said. The research team found the evidence confirming the stability of the East Antarctic ice sheet at an altitude of 6,200 feet, about 400 miles from the South Pole at the edge of what’s called the polar plateau, a flat, high surface of the ice sheet covering much of East Antarctica.
To understand how an ice sheet changes through time, a continuous historical record of those changes is needed, according to Licht. The team found layers of sediment and rocks that built up over time, recording the flow of the ice sheet and reflecting climate change. Finding that record was a challenge because glaciers moving on land tend to wipe out and cover up previous movements of the glacier, Licht said.
The big question the team wanted to answer was how sensitive the East Antarctic sheet might be to climate change. „There are models that predict that the interior of the East Antarctic ice sheet wouldn’t change very much, even if the West Antarctic ice sheet was taken away,“ Licht said. According to these models, even if the ice sheet’s perimeter retreats, its core remains stable. „It turns out that our data supports those models,“ she said. „It’s nice to have that validation.“
The team’s research findings are presented in a paper, “Middle to Late Pleistocene stability of the central East Antarctic Ice Sheet at the head of Law Glacier,” that was published today online in the journal Geology.  The research presented is in collaboration with Mike Kaplan, Gisela Winckler, Joerg Schaefer and Roseanne Schwartz at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York.”
A Nature Editorial also dealt with the current growth of the East Antarctic ice in January 2018. Of course, the ice in this region has also been worse at times, so it continues to heat up. However, one would have to go back to the warm Pliocene (5.3-2.6 million years before today):
A history of instability
The East Antarctic ice sheet may be gaining mass in the current, warming climate. The palaeoclimate record shows, however, that it has retreated during previous episodes of prolonged warmth.
The phrase “at a glacial pace” once invoked a sense of slow and unchangeable movement, an almost imperceptible motion. But decades of remote sensing and seafloor observations have shown that glaciers and ice sheets can respond to disturbances much more dynamically than once thought. But as satellites captured the surges and retreat of Greenland’s maritime glaciers in the past decades the Antarctic ice sheets — east and west of the Trans-Antarctic mountains — were at least assumed to be stable. But this, too, turned out to be wrong. First came sediment1 and model2 evidence that the West Antarctic ice sheet collapsed during previous interglacial periods and under Pliocene warmth. Then came erosional data showing that several regions of the East Antarctic ice sheet also retreated and advanced throughout the Pliocene3. An extended record4 of ice-sheet extent from elsewhere on the East Antarctic coast now paints a more complicated picture of the sensitivity of this ice sheet to warming.”
Curiously enough, half a year later, the tide turned when a paper by Shakun et al. 2018, also in Nature, saw no major problems for the Antarctic ice in the Pliocene:
Minimal East Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat onto land during the past eight million years
The East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) is the largest potential contributor to sea-level rise. However, efforts to predict the future evolution of the EAIS are hindered by uncertainty in how it responded to past warm periods, for example, during the Pliocene epoch (5.3 to 2.6 million years ago), when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were last higher than 400 parts per million. Geological evidence indicates that some marine-based portions of the EAIS and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreated during parts of the Pliocene1,2, but it remains unclear whether ice grounded above sea level also experienced retreat. This uncertainty persists because global sea-level estimates for the Pliocene have large uncertainties and cannot be used to rule out substantial terrestrial ice loss3, and also because direct geological evidence bearing on past ice retreat on land is lacking. Here we show that land-based sectors of the EAIS that drain into the Ross Sea have been stable throughout the past eight million years. We base this conclusion on the extremely low concentrations of cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al isotopes found in quartz sand extracted from a land-proximal marine sediment core. This sediment had been eroded from the continent, and its low levels of cosmogenic nuclides indicate that it experienced only minimal exposure to cosmic radiation, suggesting that the sediment source regions were covered in ice. These findings indicate that atmospheric warming during the past eight million years was insufficient to cause widespread or long-lasting meltback of the EAIS margin onto land. We suggest that variations in Antarctic ice volume in response to the range of global temperatures experienced over this period—up to 2–3 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures4, corresponding to future scenarios involving carbon dioxide concentrations of between 400 and 500 parts per million—were instead driven mostly by the retreat of marine ice margins, in agreement with the latest models5,6.”

Antarctica stable
Eight million years ago, the earth’s atmosphere had a similar CO2 content as today. Investigations now show that the Antarctic ice sheet had hardly retreated at that time. The ice is apparently more stable than expected. Click here for the press release from the National Science Foundation. You can also read an article in Popular Mechanics.
University of Edinburgh press release from 2017::
Central parts of Antarctica’s ice sheet have been stable for millions of years, from a time when conditions were considerably warmer than now, research suggests.
The study of mountains in West Antarctica will help scientists improve their predictions of how the region might respond to continuing climate change. Its findings could also show how ice loss might contribute to sea level rise.
Although the discovery demonstrates the long-term stability of some parts of Antarctica’s ice sheet, scientists remain concerned that ice at its coastline is vulnerable to rising temperatures. Researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh and Northumbria studied rocks on slopes of the Ellsworth Mountains, whose peaks protrude through the ice sheet. By mapping and analysing surface rocks — including measuring their exposure to cosmic rays — researchers calculated that the mountains have been shaped by an ice sheet over a million-year period, beginning in a climate some 20C warmer than at present.
The last time such climates existed in the mountains of Antarctica was 14 million years ago when vegetation grew in the mountains and beetles thrived. Antarctica’s climate at the time would be similar to that of modern day Patagonia or Greenland. This time marked the start of a period of cooling and the growth of a large ice sheet that extended offshore around the Antarctic continent. Glaciers have subsequently cut deep into the landscape, leaving a high-tide mark — known as a trimline — in the exposed peaks of the Ellsworth range.
The extended ice sheet cooled the oceans and atmosphere, helping form the world of today, researchers say. Their study is among the first to find evidence for this period in West Antarctica. The research, published in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, was done in collaboration with the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre. It was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council and supported by British Antarctic Survey.
Professor David Sugden, of the University of Edinburgh’s School of GeoSciences, said: „These findings help us understand how the Antarctic Ice Sheet has evolved, and to fine-tune our models and predict its future. The preservation of old rock surfaces is testimony to the stability of at least the central parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet — but we are still very concerned over other parts of Antarctica amid climate change.“
As the ice in West Antarctica melts, it rises isostatically, which in turn stabilizes the overlying ice, found a research team from Denmark and Colorado.
Again and again there are the climate stories about the Totten Glacier in the East-Arctic Wilkesland. Gwyther et al. 2018 was able to show that the basal melting of the glacier is subject to strong natural fluctuations (press release of the NSIDC here). There is no long-term melting trend.
Melting from volcanoes
Glaciers in the western Ross Sea are also stable (Fountain et al. 2017, press release here). The rapidly melting Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica has a hot secret that has now been revealed: Beneath the glacier lies a previously unknown volcanic heat source. University of Rhode Island press release from June 2018 (via EurekAlert!):

Plays critical role in movement, melting
A researcher from the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography and five other scientists have discovered an active volcanic heat source beneath the Pine Island Glacier in Antarctica. The discovery and other findings, which are critical to understanding the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, of which the Pine Island Glacier is a part, are published in the paper, „Evidence of an active volcanic heat source beneath the Pine Island Glacier,“ in the latest edition of Nature Communications.
Assistant Professor Brice Loose of Newport, a chemical oceanographer at GSO and the lead author, said the paper is based on research conducted during a major expedition in 2014 to Antarctica led by scientists from the United Kingdom. They worked aboard an icebreaker, the RRS James Clark Ross, from January to March, Antarctica’s summer. „We were looking to better understand the role of the ocean in melting the ice shelf,“ Loose said. „I was sampling the water for five different noble gases, including helium and xenon. I use these noble gases to trace ice melt as well as heat transport. Helium-3, the gas that indicates volcanism, is one of the suite of gases that we obtain from this tracing method. „We weren’t looking for volcanism, we were using these gases to trace other actions,“ he said. „When we first started seeing high concentrations of helium-3, we thought we had a cluster of bad or suspicious data.“
The West Antarctic Ice Sheet lies atop a major volcanic rift system, but there had been no evidence of current magmatic activity, the URI scientist said. The last such activity was 2,200 years ago, Loose said. And while volcanic heat can be traced to dormant volcanoes, what the scientists found at Pine Island was new. In the paper, Loose said that the volcanic rift system makes it difficult to measure heat flow to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. „You can’t directly measure normal indicators of volcanism — heat and smoke — because the volcanic rift is below many kilometers of ice,“ Loose said
But as the team conducted its research, it found high quantities of an isotope of helium, which comes almost exclusively from mantle, Loose said. „When you find helium-3, it’s like a fingerprint for volcanism. We found that it is relatively abundant in the seawater at the Pine Island shelf. „The volcanic heat sources were found beneath the fastest moving and the fastest melting glacier in Antarctica, the Pine Island Glacier,“ Loose said. „It is losing mass the fastest.“ He said the amount of ice sliding into the ocean is measured in gigatons. A gigaton equals 1 billion metric tons.
However, Loose cautions, this does not imply that volcanism is the major source of mass loss from Pine Island. On the contrary, „there are several decades of research documenting the heat from ocean currents is destabilizing Pine Island Glacier, which in turn appears to be related to a change in the climatological winds around Antarctica,“ Loose said. Instead, this evidence of volcanism is a new factor to consider when monitoring the stability of the ice sheet.
The scientists report in the paper that „helium isotope and noble gas measurements provide geochemical evidence of sub-glacial meltwater production that is subsequently transported to the cavity of the Pine Island Ice Shelf.“ They say that heat energy released by the volcanoes and hydrothermal vents suggests that the heat source beneath Pine Island is about 25 times greater than the bulk of heat flux from an individual dormant volcano.
Professor Karen Heywood, from the University of East Anglia in Norwich, the United Kingdom, and chief scientist for the expedition, said: ‘The discovery of volcanoes beneath the Antarctic ice sheet means that there is an additional source of heat to melt the ice, lubricate its passage toward the sea, and add to the melting from warm ocean waters. It will be important to include this in our efforts to estimate whether the Antarctic ice sheet might become unstable and further increase sea level rise.’
Does that mean that global climate change is not a factor in the stability of the Pine Island Glacier? No, said Loose. ‘Climate change is causing the bulk of glacial melt that we observe, and this newly discovered source of heat is having an as-yet undetermined effect, because we do not know how this heat is distributed beneath the ice sheet.’
He said other studies have shown that melting caused by climate change is reducing the size and weight of the glacier, which reduces the pressure on the mantle, allowing greater heat from the volcanic source to escape and then warm the ocean water. ‘Predicting the rate of sea level rise is going to be a key role for science over the next 100 years, and we are doing that. We are monitoring and modeling these glaciers,’ Loose said.
The scientists conclude by writing: ‘The magnitude and the variations in the rate of the volcanic heat supplied to the Pine Island Glacier, either by internal magma migration, or by an increase in volcanism as a consequence of ice sheet thinning, may impact the future dynamics of the Pine Island Glacier, during the contemporary period of climate-driven glacial retreat.’
In addition to Heywood, Loose worked with Alberto C. Naveira Garabato, of the National Oceanography Centre at the University of Southampton, United Kingdom; Peter Schlosser of Arizona State University’s School of Earth and Space Exploration and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University; William Jenkins of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts; and David Vaughn of the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, United Kingdom.”

The West Antarctic Kamb Ice Stream has always puzzled the researchers because here the ice thickened, in contrast to the general melting trend in West Antarctica. What could be the cause? Another volcano, as reported by the University of Washington in 2018: University of Washington 2018:
Volcano under ice sheet suggests thickening of West Antarctic ice is short-term
A region of West Antarctica is behaving differently from most of the continent’s ice: A large patch of ice there is thickening, unlike other parts of West Antarctica that are losing ice. Whether this thickening trend will continue affects the overall amount that melting or collapsing glaciers could raise the level of the world’s oceans.
A study led by the University of Washington has discovered a new clue to this region’s behavior: A volcano under the ice sheet has left an almost 6,000-year record of the glacier’s motion. The track hidden in the middle of the ice sheet suggests that the current thickening is just a short-term feature that may not affect the glacier over the long term. It also suggests that similar clues to the past may be hiding deep inside the ice sheet itself. ‘What’s exciting about this study is that we show how the structure of the ice sheet acts as a powerful record of what has happened in the past,’ said Nicholas Holschuh, a UW postdoctoral researcher in Earth and space sciences. He is first author of the paper published Sept. 4 in The Cryosphere.
The data come from the ice above Mount Resnik, a 1.6-kilometer (mile-high) inactive volcano that currently sits under 300 meters (0.19 miles) of ice. The volcano lies just upstream of the thickening Kamb Ice Stream, part of a dynamic coastal region of ice that drains into Antarctica’s Ross Sea. Studies show Kamb Ice Stream has flowed quickly in the past but stalled more than a century ago, leaving the region’s ice to drain via the four other major ice streams, a switch that glaciologists think happens every few hundred years. Meanwhile the ice inland of Kamb Ice Stream is beginning to bulge, and it is unclear what will happen next. ‘The shutdown of Kamb Ice Stream started long before the satellite era,’ Holschuh said. ‘We need some longer-term indicators for its behavior to understand how important this shutdown is for the future of the region’s ice.’
The paper analyzes two radar surveys of the area’s ice. One was collected in 2002 by co-authors Robert Jacobel and Brian Welch, using the ice-penetrating radar system at St. Olaf College in Minnesota, and the other in 2004 by co-author Howard Conway, a UW research professor of Earth and space sciences. Conway noticed the missing layers and asked his colleagues to investigate. “It wasn’t until we had spent probably six months with this data set that we started to piece together the fact that this thing that we could see within the ice sheet was forming in response to the subglacial volcano,” Holschuh said.
The study shows that the mysterious feature originates at the ice covering Mount Resnik. The authors believe that the volcano’s height pushes the relatively thin ice sheet up so much that it changes the local wind fields, and affects depositing of snow. So as the ice sheet passes over the volcano a section missed out on a few annual layers of snow. “These missing layers are common in East Antarctica, where there is less precipitation and strong winds can strip away the surface snow,” Holschuh said. “But this is really one of the first times we’ve seen these missing layers in West Antarctica. It’s also the first time an unconformity has been used to reconstruct ice sheet motion of the past.”
Over time, the glacial record shows that this feature followed a straight path toward the sea. During the 5,700-year record, the five major coastal ice streams are thought to have sped up and slowed down several times, as water on the base lubricates the glacier’s flow and then periodically gets diverted, stalling one of the ice streams. “Despite the fact that there are all these dramatic changes at the coast, the ice flowing in the interior was not really affected,” Holschuh said.
What the feature does show is that a change occurred a few thousand years ago. Previous UW research shows rapid retreat at the edge of the ice sheet until about 3,400 years ago, part of the recovery from the most recent ice age. The volcano track also shows a thinning of the ice at about this time. “It means that the interior of the ice sheet is responding to the large-scale climate forcing from the last glacial maximum to today,” Holschuh said. “So the long-timescale climatic forcing is very consistent between the interior and the coast, but the shorter-timescale processes are really apparent in the coastal record but aren’t visible in the interior.”
Holschuh cautions that this is only a single data point and needs confirmation from other observations. He is part of an international team of Antarctic scientists looking at combining the hundreds of radar scans of Antarctic and Greenland glaciers that were originally done to measure ice thickness. Those data may also contain unique details of the glacier’s internal structure that can be used to recreate the history of the ice sheet’s motion.
“These persistent tracers of historic ice flow are probably all over the place,” Holschuh said. “The more we can tease apart the stories of past motion told by the structure of the ice sheet, the more realistic we can be in our predictions of how it will respond to future climate change.” The research was funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA. The other co-author is Knut Christianson, a UW assistant professor of Earth and space sciences.
Blown soot apparently has no influence on the Antarctic glaciers in the McMurdo dry valleys, Khan et al. 2018 (press release).
Medley & Thomas 2019 documented an increase in snowfall in the Antarctic, which benefited the ice sheet (NASA press release here). The authors establish a connection with the SAM ocean cycle, the Southern Annular Mode. The University of Colorado in Boulder, however, blames the increase in snowfall on the ozone hole (press release, paper by Lenaerts et al. 2018).
Jenkins et al. 2018 pointed to decadal cycles in the melting of the West Antarctic ice sheet at the edge of the Amundsen Sea. The relationship between melting and ocean temperature is nonlinear:
West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat in the Amundsen Sea driven by decadal oceanic variability
Mass loss from the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet has increased in recent decades, suggestive of sustained ocean forcing or an ongoing, possibly unstable, response to a past climate anomaly. Lengthening satellite records appear to be incompatible with either process, however, revealing both periodic hiatuses in acceleration and intermittent episodes of thinning. Here we use ocean temperature, salinity, dissolved-oxygen and current measurements taken from 2000 to 2016 near the Dotson Ice Shelf to determine temporal changes in net basal melting. A decadal cycle dominates the ocean record, with melt changing by a factor of about four between cool and warm extremes via a nonlinear relationship with ocean temperature. A warm phase that peaked around 2009 coincided with ice-shelf thinning and retreat of the grounding line, which re-advanced during a post-2011 cool phase. These observations demonstrate how discontinuous ice retreat is linked with ocean variability, and that the strength and timing of decadal extremes is more influential than changes in the longer-term mean state. The nonlinear response of melting to temperature change heightens the sensitivity of Amundsen Sea ice shelves to such variability, possibly explaining the vulnerability of the ice sheet in that sector, where subsurface ocean temperatures are relatively high.
And here are even more temporally variable relationships. Wang et al. 2019: reported on temporally variable relationships of the surface ice mass balance in West Antarctica with the SAM cycle and ENSO:
A New 200‐Year Spatial Reconstruction of West Antarctic Surface Mass Balance
High‐spatial resolution surface mass balance (SMB) over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) spanning 1800–2010 is reconstructed by means of ice core records combined with the outputs of the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts “Interim” reanalysis (ERA‐Interim) and the latest polar version of the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2.3p2). The reconstruction reveals a significant negative trend (−1.9 ± 2.2 Gt/year·per decade) in the SMB over the entire WAIS during the nineteenth century, but a statistically significant positive trend of 5.4 ± 2.9 Gt/year·per decade between 1900 and 2010, in contrast to insignificant WAIS SMB changes during the twentieth century reported earlier. At regional scales, the Antarctic Peninsula and western WAIS show opposite SMB trends, with different signs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The annual resolution reconstruction allows us to examine the relationships between SMB and large‐scale atmospheric oscillations. Although SMB over the Antarctic Peninsula and western WAIS correlates significantly with the Southern Annular Mode due to the influence of the Amundsen Sea Low, and El Niño/Southern Oscillation during 1800–2010, the significant correlations are temporally unstable, associated with the phase of Southern Annular Mode, El Niño/Southern Oscillation and the Pacific decadal oscillation. In addition, the two climate modes seem to contribute little to variability in SMB over the whole WAIS on decadal‐centennial time scales. This new reconstruction also serves to identify unreliable precipitation trends in ERA‐Interim and thus has potential for assessing the skill of other reanalyses or climate models to capture precipitation trends and variability.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAn expert psychoanalyst appeared on German television to provide his view on Greta’s high-octane anger, see (German) video below:

At her speech at the UN, Greta’s voice was filled with worry and acute anger. When asked about the source of the intense emotions, German psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and book author Hans-Joachim Maaz commented:
What’s really bad about it, is the marketing, what is being made of her, how she is being, shall we say, used or misused for certain interests. […] I don’t find this is appropriate. I would surely critically ask the parents what they intend by all this, that they are tolerating this, that they are indeed promoting  Greta’s personal problem. I find this ethically problematic.”
Anger has other sources
About the pain and anger in her performance in New York that was accompanied by emotionally charged accusations that her youth and life have been destroyed by the climate situation, Maaz says: “That’s just not real. It’s not the case. She just hasn’t had any such really serious experience that would justify such anger. But she harbors such affects within herself and they certainly have a totally other source.”
The German psychiatrist adds:
That they fundamentally allow her to storm in such a direction, without taking her problems into account, without giving her help – that I find to be highly troublesome.”

"Gaze out from the deck of a boat and you will see an ocean that was, in Henry David Thoreau’s phrase, “equally wild and unfathomable always”. There’s a stark contrast in appearance here between the apparently rugged and pristine ocean and our landscapes, so obviously and extensively modified by humans. As well as wild, of course the oceans are vast – they cover some 70% of Earth’s surface, and with an average depth approaching 4km they make up 99% of our planet’s living space.  As for the organisms that inhabit our oceans – well, everyone knows they are phenomenally abundant, geographically widespread, and enormously fertile, right? Together, the vastness of the oceans and the exuberance of marine life makes the concept of marine extinction little more than a far-fetched idea. A decade ago, one of us (Dulvy) decided to take a fresh look at some of these assumptions, reviewing what was then known about marine extinctions, and questioning the easy contrasts often made between marine (widespread, abundant, safe) and non-marine (specialist, rare, threatened) organisms.  Now, the other one of us (Webb) has published a new study in the journal Current Biology that attempts to put on an equal footing extinction risk across both marine and non-marine environments.  We did this by summarising data compiled in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species across all major taxonomic groups, separately for marine and non-marine species. This could only have been possible through a decade-long concerted effort by the union to ramp up its assessment of marine organisms.  On the face of it, our results appear to support the view that marine species are at less risk. Simple views of such statistics have previously been used to confirm expectations that extinction risk is lower in the oceans. When we dig deeper into these numbers, however, a rather different picture emerges. Our comparisons can only consider those species which have had their conservation status formally assessed on the red list. Despite 50 years of effort by tens of thousands of volunteers, during which more than 70,000 species have been assessed, we still know the status of just 3% of known marine and 4% of known non-marine species.  Across all these assessed species, extinction rates in non-marine groups are around twice those in marine groups – a much lower figure than previously thought. Digging further still, the pattern changes markedly when we focus only on the best studied groups. This generally means the more charismatic, recognisable animals such as turtles or seabirds. While there are many more species of sea snails or crustaceans out there waiting to be discovered, taxonomists are unlikely to discover many new seabirds. Naturally we expect the most robust estimate of extinction and threat rates for these best-studied groups. And of these animals on average 20-25% of species are threatened with extinction, regardless of whether they live on land or in sea. Marine extinction risk has ramped up rapidly in the past 50 years, to converge upon the level of risk seen on land. There are of course some caveats to consider. Most significantly, very few marine groups meet our criteria for being “well known”, and most of those that do are atypical. Some 90% of the 225,000 or so known sea species are invertebrates, with the diversity of fish more than matched by many less eye-catching groups. But the well-known groups are mainly vertebrates (seabirds, marine mammals, fish, turtles) or otherwise tied to our coastal seas (mangroves, seagrasses, corals). Well-known groups of land animals are similarly biased towards the charismatic and convenient but – and here is a genuine marine-terrestrial contrast – most terrestrial biodiversity is contained within fewer groups to start with. Thus, while flowering plants and insects together cover much of the diversity of life on land, life in the sea is spread more evenly across dozens of major groups. Indeed, a striking finding of this new study is that 64 of the 88 major groups of marine life, together containing almost a third of known marine species, have had no members at all assessed. Clearly the final word on marine extinction rates cannot be written until some at least of these gaps are filled in.  This task falls entirely to the volunteer scientists working in their spare time with little credit, and less funding. Securing this work is vital to ensure that we understand the true research and conservation priorities rather than that provided by the increasingly barren narrative litany of ocean calamities. Despite the lack of overall representation of the marine tree of life in the new study, one group that is included is the archetypal “extinction-proof” marine fish. Thomas Henry Huxley, Darwin’s Bulldog himself, pronounced with authoritative confidence at the 1883 Fisheries Exhibition in London “probably all the great sea fisheries, are inexhaustible; that is to say, that nothing we do seriously affects the number of the fish,” a preconception that still clings stubbornly to 21st century discourse.  The emerging evidence over the past decade shows that abundant/widespread/fertile paradigm of marine life histories is the exception rather than the rule. So are marine species safe from harm? This new work confirms that the precautionary working hypothesis is, “no more than those on land”."
"Straw is cheap, good for the environment and an excellent insulator. So why don’t we see more straw houses? Unless we suddenly stop eating bread or cereal it’ll keep being produced anyway, and the excess straw in the UK alone could build a new city each year.  The UK construction sector must reduce its energy consumption by 50% and its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050, so radical changes are needed to the way we approach building houses. Straw could be a critical part of the transition towards a low-carbon future. The thermal insulation value of a typical straw bale wall meets the requirements of even the most demanding performance specifications. Recent research led by the BRE Centre for Innovative Construction Materials at the University of Bath has shown that straw bale buildings reduce energy bills by 90% compared to conventional housing stock. The manufacture of cement, used in concrete, is responsible alone for up to 8% of all industrially produced greenhouse gas emissions. Using natural materials such as straw, often directly from the field and with little further processing, significantly reduces this impact. Traditionally, the environmental impact of construction materials has been significantly less than the impact of occupation (heating, cooling and so on) over the lifespan of the building. However, in modern energy efficient buildings the proportion attributable to that “embodied” in the fabric of the building is expected to increase to at least 90%. Measures to reduce the impact of the embodied energy and carbon will deliver even more environmentally friendly buildings. Straw is just the dried stalks of plants stripped of their grain. You don’t really “make straw” – it’s a co-product of grain production, an established and essential agricultural process. So using straw doesn’t displace land required for essential food production.  In the UK more than 7m tonnes of straw remains after the production of wheat flour, and up to half this amount is effectively discarded due to its low value – simply chopped up and returned to the soil. As an average three-bedroom house needs 7.2 tonnes of straw, the “leftover” could be used to build more than 500,000 new homes – a city the size of Birmingham could be built each year using discarded straw. Straw is also a low-cost material. But more importantly, as a plant it captures and stores atmospheric carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. By using more and more straw in buildings we are creating a natural carbon storage bank. Though the bible references using straw for bricks – and thatched roofs – have been common for centuries, modern straw construction was developed when mechanical baling machines were first used in late 19th-century Nebraska. Stacked like large bricks, straw bales can be used for modest loadbearing as well as non-loadbearing walls. The oldest surviving straw bale building is around 100 years old. But straw has never caught on as an alternative to bricks, concrete or timber. There are concerns about its poor durability, fire resistance, the way it attracts mice and rats and, as one of the three little pigs found out the hard way, its lack of structural integrity. Straw bales aren’t currently made to the same levels of tolerance and specification as bricks or cement. The fact they’re generally slightly different sizes combined with the need to keep bales dry during construction has meant most builders would not, until recently, consider straw bales a viable solution for anything. Other than perhaps for enthusiastic self-builders. However, the development of prefabricated wall panels using straw bale for insulation has now provided the opportunity to market straw to the mainstream construction industry. Prefabrication, or off-site manufacture, means that wall panels can be made to a very high specification in a factory, protected from variable weather conditions that would otherwise inhibit on-site building with straw.  A prefabricated product can be certified as fit for use by industry bodies, making it much more acceptable to builders, financiers and insurers. It also radically reduces site construction times, with houses able to be erected in ten weeks instead of around 16 weeks for more conventional buildings. It seems the time has arrived for straw bale construction. For the past ten years the University of Bath has been working with a local company, ModCell, to develop prefabricated straw bales. We started out looking at straw as a low-carbon cladding solution and soon moved on to developing panels that could bear heavy loads. Now, we are able to make low-energy prefabricated straw bale houses. The panels have been subjected to fire tests, thermal transmittance tests, accelerated weathering tests, acoustic tests, simulated flooding and impact testing. We’ve even tested the structures in a simulated hurricane force wind, in what has been termed the “big bad wolf” test: the panels and prototype BaleHaus passed with flying colours. These panels have now been granted certification. This in turn means insurers will cover straw houses and home-buyers will be able to obtain mortgages. Hayesfield School in Bath, EcoDepot in York and the School of Architecture at the University of the West of England have all made use of these panels. Certification means the housing market can now use straw too, with LILAC in Leeds completed in 2013 and now a new development in Bristol due for completion later this year, with proposals for larger schemes already in planning. Modern prefabricated straw bale houses are affordable, deliver excellent levels of energy efficiency in use for the home-owner or occupier and provide a genuine sustainable solution by using a cheap and widely available agricultural co-product. Other similar prefabricated systems using straw bale construction have been developed in Australia, Belgium and Canada. Entire communities, towns or even cities built from straw bales. And why not?"
"Arctic sea ice melts each summer, reaching its minimum extent sometime in September, before refreezing through the winter. Over the past 35 years, the September sea ice extent has reduced by about 35% overall and this decline is projected to continue as global temperatures increase. In 2007 and 2012 the summer ice extent was dramatically lower, causing some some media speculation that we would soon see a summer which was “ice-free” (meaning a year with less than 1 million km2 of sea-ice).  Most climate scientists were more cautious. The weather in 2007 and 2012 was warmer than usual and the winds were particularly favourable for melting sea ice. Although human influence on Arctic sea ice has been
detected, there was no evidence that these weather patterns would continue each year.  In contrast, 2013 and 2014 had more sea ice than 2012, causing other  speculation that a recovery was underway. Is this claim warranted? The figure below shows Arctic sea ice extent (the black line) has undergone a long-term decrease, with the dashed line representing a linear trend. But there have also been shorter periods of rapid melt, no change, and apparent increases in extent during this decline – represented below by coloured trend lines for some deliberately chosen eight year periods. The most recent eight-year period, starting from the extreme low of 2007, shows an upward trend. This does not mean that the Arctic sea ice is recovering. As with global temperature, these erratic changes are what we expect to see. Imagine a ball bouncing down a bumpy hill. Gravity will ensure that the ball will move downwards. But if the ball hits a bump at a certain angle it might move horizontally or even upwards for a time, before resuming its inevitable downward trajectory. This bouncing ball is an analogy for the changing Arctic sea ice.  The hill represents the long-term downward trend in Arctic sea ice due to increasing global temperatures and the bumps introduce changes from this smooth trajectory. These erratic bounces could be in either direction, causing an apparent acceleration or temporary reduction in melt rate. By only examining a small part of the trajectory you might conclude that the ball was moving against gravity. A longer term view would see it as a bounce. There is no expectation that sea ice, or any other aspect of the climate, will change smoothly over time. The climate system simply does not work that way. Previous studies have suggested that natural climate variations (or “bounces”) play a key role in how sea ice evolves, and suggested that some of the rapid melt in the early 2000s was a temporary acceleration.  A new study I co-authored with a team of Canadian and American scientists, published in Nature Climate Change, highlights that the recent slower melt is a temporary, but not unexpected, deceleration. The complex climate models used to make projections of future climate also exhibit similar periods of little change and more rapid change in Arctic sea ice. The recent  trends are well within the range of these expectations. We might even see a decade or more with little apparent change in sea ice. The causes of these fluctuations in melt rate are still being explored. One suggestion is that slow variations in Atlantic sea surface temperatures are involved. More observations of the Arctic ocean, atmosphere and sea ice would help answer this question. When will the Arctic be ice-free – or equivalently, when will the ball reach the bottom of the hill? The IPCC concluded it was likely that the Arctic would be reliably ice-free in September by 2050, assuming high future greenhouse gas emissions (where “reliably ice-free” means five consecutive years with less than 1 million km2 of sea ice). We expect the long-term decline in Arctic sea ice to continue as global temperatures rise. There will also be further bounces, both up and down. Individual years will be ice-free sometime in the 2020s, 2030s or 2040s, depending on both future greenhouse gas emissions and these natural fluctuations.  Even when it reaches the bottom of the hill the ball will continue to bounce. Similarly, not every future year will be ice-free in summer. But if global temperatures continue to increase the bounces will become smaller and the ice-free periods will spread from late summer into autumn and early summer.  Commercial Arctic shipping is already increasing to exploit shorter journey times from Europe to Asia, while oil, gas & mineral extraction possibilities are being explored and Arctic tourism is growing. Decisions about such activities need to assess both the risks and opportunities. The important role of natural sea ice fluctuations needs to be considered in such assessments."

In the UK Channel 4 produced a new documentary titled:
The Great Global Warming Swindle  This is well worth watching, especially if you’ve ever doubted the veracity of such claims, no matter which side you find yourself on. 
Through interviews with prize-winning climate experts and others, this masterful documentary explains the origins of global warming alarmism; factually addresses claims of man-made global climate change; exposes the motivations of organizations, scientists and activists sounding the alarm; and explains why it’s been extremely difficult, if not downright career killing, for scientists to question global warming orthodoxy publicly.
While presenting hard facts, it is artfully done, making it watchable for the layman and scientist alike.

For all those folks worried that a cell phone tower at the Elks Lodge or Hooker Oak Park is going to give rise to a legion of cancer ridden mutants, here’s another study that says “not likely”
March 26, 2007 (Reuters) —
Cell phone use does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of glioma, the most common type of brain tumor, according to a new study.
“Public concern has been expressed about the possible adverse health effects of mobile telephones, mainly related to [brain] tumors,” Dr. Anna Lahkola, a researcher at the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Helsinki, and colleagues explain in the International Journal of Cancer.
The researchers examined the relationship between mobile phone use and risk of glioma by studying 1,521 glioma patients and 3,301 controls.

The vast majority of both groups reported using cell phones. Overall, 92% of glioma patients and 94% of controls reported using mobile phones.
Overall, there was no evidence of increased glioma risk related to regular mobile phone use.
There were no significant associations observed with duration of use, years since first use, cumulative number of calls or cumulative hours of use.
No increased glioma risk was observed when analog and digital phones were analyzed separately.
There was, however, a trend toward increased risk of glioma in people who used a cell phone for more than 10 years exclusively on one side of the head, which was on the same side as the tumor. The association reached “borderline statistical significance.”
“This may be due either to chance or causal effect or information bias, i.e., overreporting of mobile phone use on the affected side by the cases with brain tumors,” the investigators wrote

"A £30bn British pension fund has threatened to sack investment managers that do not take action on the climate crisis, criticising the sector as “not fit for purpose”. Brunel Pension Partnership, which manages pension money for nine councils in south-west England as well as for the Environment Agency, said it would review the mandates of asset managers that don’t reduce exposure to climate risk by 2022.  The Bristol-based pension fund will demand that companies in which it invests take steps to align their emissions with targets agreed at the 2015 Paris climate summit. Brunel will vote against the reappointment of board members of companies that who are not doing enough, and could also sell its stakes from 2022 onwards. Its new policy reflects the increasing pressure on the role of the asset management sector in abetting the climate crisis. Research by InfluenceMap, a non-profit, found that the portfolios of the world’s 15 largest asset managers were overweight in polluting companies, while the largest US managers opposed the majority of climate-based shareholder votes at the companies in which they invested. Mark Mansley, Brunel’s chief investment officer, said: “Climate change is a rapidly escalating investment issue. We found that the finance sector is part of the problem, when it could and should be part of the solution for addressing climate change.” Brunel’s money is spread between more than 130 investment managers, some of whom control hundreds of billions or even trillions of pounds in assets. Brunel’s managers include Aberdeen Standard, Invesco, Legal & General Investment Management, Royal London Asset Management and Wellington Management. While many asset managers have all but ignored environmental campaigners, the prospect of asset owners such as pension funds withdrawing their lucrative business has prompted some big investors to reassess their climate policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager with more than $6.9tn (£5.3tn) in assets and another manager of Brunel’s assets, last week bowed to pressure to improve its response to the climate crisis, saying it would divest from companies producing thermal coal and increasingly offer fossil fuel-free products, among other initiatives. Brunel said it had found short-termist thinking and an unwillingness among asset managers to invest in companies pursuing low-carbon technologies, and added that risk models used by investors often relied on flawed assumptions that did not take into account climate risks. Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency, said: “Now is the time for everyone in the finance sector to show leadership in response to the climate emergency.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt COP 25 in Madrid, Princeton physicist and former President Trump advisor Prof. em. William Happer spoke on the “false pretenses of a climate emergency” and called the climate protection movement a “bizarre environmental cult”, “absurd” and “madness”.

Princeton University, Professor Emeritus, Dr. Will Happer Discusses the False Pretenses of a ""#ClimateEmergency""https://t.co/Xl1kn0wWcG#ClimateBrawl
— CO2 Coalition (@CO2Coalition) December 6, 2019

The distinguished professor said, “It’s too bad we are here on false pretenses, wasting our time talking about a non-existent climate emergency.”
“Bizarre environmental cult”
Some 25,000 delegates have flown into Madrid to express their panic over a perceived climate emergency and to pressure governments to take radical actions to profoundly alter human behavior.
Happer added: “I hope sooner or later enough people will recognize the phoniness of this bizarre environmental cult and bring it to an end.”
In his talk, Happer warned leading politicians against viewing combatting CO2 as a religion, and cautioned it could end up badly when millions of people become obsessed with a single delusion and become stark-raving mad at climate. He said there’s been “so much brainwashing that it’s going to be difficult to bring people back to reality.”
The distinguished Princeton professor said the focus needs to be on pollution, and not CO2, and that solar energy and wind energy blight the environment and don’t work very well.
Only very little impact on climate

On the physics of CO2 trapping heat, Happer presents a CO2 chart and suggests that doubling the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere will have very little impact on climate and that he “can guarantee that no one who knows anything about science can dispute this curve. That’s the truth.”
“Absolute madness”
Taking action based on the curves that show CO2 has little effect, Happer says this is “absolute madness.”
The Princeton physicist also believes the climate models greatly exaggerate the warming and that the trace gas is in fact beneficial to the planet. Today atmospheric concentrations are extremely low compared to previous geological times:

The extra CO2 recently added into the atmosphere has in fact led to a greening of the planet, Happer shows.
“Phony consensus”
Next Happer called the often claimed 97% consensus among scientists “phony” and that science is determined by observation, “not votes”. “Scientific consensus is often wrong,” Happer showed.
Happer summarized that CO2’s impact has been exaggerated “by a factor of 2 to 4”, and that overall a little extra CO2 in the atmosphere is beneficial to vegetation and agriculture.
The whole CO2/climate worry “is absolutely absurd. It’s a cult,” Happer concludes.

Last week I was informed that the MBNA credit card I’ve had for years was “acquired” by Bank of America. Ok no big deal, mergers go around all the time as big corporations get even bigger by swallowing other corporations whole.
But I was shocked to discover that my interest rate had soared. It was around 12% previously, but now, thanks to the merger and corporate greed used to pay for that merger, my interest rate was raised to: (drum roll, and please sit down while reading) 24.97%  !!  The friendly note from the “BofA customer satisfaction center: said  “I could of course pay off the balance and avoid the rate change”. Gee, thanks.
WTH? I have excellent credit, no late payments on this card, and I’ve been with BofA since 1994 when Jolene Francis signed me up. I’ve had business loans, home loans, car loans, and my savings, personal, and business checking account with BofA since then, and thanks to the same sort of corporate weasel thinking where the Bank is more important than the customer…one by one, all of these accounts where transferred to other more sensible banks when BofA announced some amazingly stupid new “plan” to improve “customer satisfaction”.
Here’s some insight into the national credit card problem by SF Chronicle columinist  David Lazarus
Now, I’d point out that an interest rate of 25% generally makes it impossible to pay off a loan if the consumer pays the minimum payment listed on the bill. So it became clear to me that BofA was financing their shiny new merger with MBNA. Despite layoffs at MBNA designed to sweeten BofA’s bottom line, they just couldn’t resist sticking consumers with the bill for their merger.
So today marks my end of my 12 year relationship with Bank of America. Hello Discover Card. Hello WaMu.
It amazes me that banks keep pulling these kind of Enronesque stunts and still keep customers. They certainly lost me, and my company business, because they simply got too greedy. The only way consumers can fight back against these sort of practices is to cancel accounts and do balance transfers to more reasonable companies. For example, Discover offered me a balance transfer at a very VERY low interest rate, a bargain compared to 25% from BofA!
From David Lazarus column I found this nugget of wisdom:
“All in all, the world of plastic is an uneven playing field. This is something that should never be far from mind as you spend the next month or so probably running up your biggest credit card bills of the year. “
Corporate mergers never seem to do anybody any good. Debt is acquired with the mergers, and workers get laid off to finance it and the customers get stuck with the bill over the long term. Customer service usually takes a nosedive. Shareholders may earn dividends, and the inner sanctum of corporate weasels that structured the deal usually make out like bandits. But the customer usually suffers at their expense.
I think on the whole, corporate mergers are bad for America, as is excessive credit card debt.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe onslaught of paleoclimate evidence for warmer-than-now Mid-Holocene climates – when the Earth’s sea levels were meters higher than they are today –  stormed through 2019.
There were 107 scientific papers published this past year indicating today’s warmth isn’t even close to being unusual or unprecedented when compared to the climates of the last centuries to millennia.
As illustrated below, there were also 19 papers affirming today’s sea levels are among the lowest of the last ~8000 years.
This is added to the list of nearly 100 scientific papers published in the last handful of years indicating Mid-Holocene sea levels were multiple meters higher than they are today due to the much more extensive glacier and ice sheet melt occuring during these millennia.

Oliver and Terry, 2019  Thailand, +2.0 to 3.8 m higher than present
“~6000 cal yr B.P. old oysters can be found from between 3.8 ± 0.1 m to 2.5 ± 0.1 m above present day mean sea level. … Dead (fossil) oysters were collected from between 1 and 3 m above the centre of the live oyster band in a more sheltered cleft inside the notch. The oldest sample with an age of 5270–4950 cal yr B.P. was collected at an elevation of 3.01 ± 0.1 m above the apex of the notch. The ages decrease with elevation down to 920–710 cal yr B.P. at 1.03 m. … In all the sites, the 14C age of the dead oysters inside the notches increases with increasing elevation above present day MSL. Clearly, relative sea level was 2 to 3 m higher than present between 6000 and 3000 B.P. and has steadily fallen since.”


Brooke et al., 2019  Queensland (NE Australia), +1-2 m higher than present
“Indicator data for Queensland have been assessed for their accuracy and robustness by Lambeck et al. (2014), who identified a number of coastal and inner shelf island sites in the northeastern region, in which Cowley Beach is located (Fig. 1), where accurately dated in situ fossil coral, coral microatolls and sediment core samples provide robust sea-level records (Chappell, 1983; Chappell et al., 1983; Horton et al., 2007; Yu and Zhao, 2010; Zwartz, 1995; Fig. 3). Here, relative sea level reached a Holocene highstand between 6770 and 5520 yr BP approximately 1–2 m above the present level (Lewis et al., 2013; Fig. 3). Following the highstand, the data record a gradual fall in sea level to the present position (Perry and Smithers, 2011; Lambeck et al., 2014). … Local and regional records for the Holocene at far-field sites may also reflect the influence of climatic variations on sea level, such as shifts in the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), that can induce minor (<0.5 m) changes in sea level (Duke et al., 2017; Leonard et al., 2018; Sloss et al., 2018) on annual to multi-decadal, rather than millennial, timescales.”

Yamano et al., 2019 SW Japan, +1.1 to 1.2 m higher than present
“Evidence from the core samples and fossil microatolls suggests sea level reached its present position before 5100 cal yr B.P., and a relative sea-level highstand of 1.1–1.2 m above the present sea level occurred from 5100 to 3600 cal yr B.P. This was followed by a gradual fall in relative sea level. The tectonically corrected sea-level curve indicates a stable sea level after 5100 cal yr BP., with a sea-level highstand of up to 0.4 m between 5100 and 3600 cal yr B.P.”
Makwana et al., 2019 Western India, +2 to 3 m higher than present
“The BB trench site is located at an elevation of 2 m above present day msl, where it shows evidences of dominant marine processes at depth of 2 m with a horizon of clay at depth of 3.2 m. In coastal environments, clayey horizons get deposited in calmer and non turbid conditions with depth > 3 m, which explains the clay horizon at BB trench site that would have been deposited with the water level depth of 3.2 m at > 2.5 ka period.”

Loveson and Nigam, 2019 Eastern India, +4 m higher than present 
“The continuous rise in sea level ever since late Pleistocene has reached the present sea level during 6800 years 100 BP and the highest sea level of about ~4m above the present sea level is observed during 6050 BP. Since then, the sea level started fluctuating in lesser magnitudes (between +4.0m to -2.0m), responding to the cycles of global ice melting and climate thereof. … It is also observed that the magnitude of all five high stands in between 7,200 to the recent has a decreasing trend from +4m to 0m. It obviously indicates that the most of the present day coastal plains were once under the sea as evidenced by the presence of many inland leftover paleo delta signatures in the East Coast of India.”

Oliver et al., 2019  South Australia, +2 m higher than present
“Raised beach strata imaged with Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) at Rivoli Bay suggest a sea-level highstand of +2 m above present ~3500 years ago, steadily falling and reaching the present ~1000 years ago.”
Kylander et al., 2019  Scotland, +9 m higher than present
“At present, the Laphroaig bog is edged by a dune system, but this sand source may have looked very different at the time peat accumulation started 6670 cal. a BP. A primary control on dune building is RSL. Glacial isostatic modelling, supported by radiocarbon-dated sea-level index points, show that the RSL on Islay was about 9 m higher at 6000 cal. a BP, and fell in a linear fashion to 2.2 m higher than present at 2000–1000 cal. a BP (Fig. 7C;Dawsonet al. 1998; Shennan et al. 2006a,b).”

Meeder and Harlem, 2019  Southeast Florida (USA), +1-1.3 m higher than present
“Sea level was at ca 8 m above present during the last interglacial ca 120,000 yr bp inundating the entire platform during deposition of the Miami Limestone strata (Moore, 1982) …  The marls form a leaky seal on the Everglades floor (Figure 14B) slowing water infiltration and storing water, increasing the hydroperiod and providing an environment suitable for peat deposition which started ca 4,500 yr bp (Gleason & Stone, 1994) at elevations between 1 and 1.3 m above present sea level (Wanless et al., 1994). … The historic high‐water stage occurred prior to drainage when the water stage was between 0.6 and 2  m higher than present in the study area (McVoy et al., 2011; Parker, 1975; Parker et al., 1955).”
Cuttler et al., 2019  Western Australia, +1-2 m higher than present
“Ningaloo Reef grew over the last ~8,000 years (Twiggs and Collins, 2010) with rapid reef build up ceasing ~5.8 ka BP when sea level was approximately 1 to 2 m higher than present. During this phase of development, benthic cover was dominated by reef-building corals (Collins et al., 2003; Twiggs and Collins, 2010). After this sea level highstand, reef evolution at Ningaloo was characterised as ‘detrital build-up and aggradational’ as sea level fell to present levels and the reef back-stepped (seaward) to its present location (Twiggs and Collins, 2010).”
Bondevik et al., 2019 Western Norway, +8.2 to +9 m higher than present
“We conclude that the maximum sea level of the Tapes transgression lasted 2000 years from 7600 cal yr BP and extended into the Early Neolithic, to about 5600 cal yr BP (Fig. 13), with an uncertainty of about 100 years. We estimate that the highest spring tide during the Tapes transgression maximum phase was between 8.2 and 9.0 m above the present mean sea level. … To account for additional uncertainties, we suggest that the spring tide sea level at Longva would have been 8.6 ± 0.4 m above present day mean sea level during the Tapes transgression maximum.”

Yamada et al., 2019   Japan, +1 m higher than present
“Post-glacial sea level reached about 1 m higher than today around 6000 years ago and then started to fall (Yokoyama et al., 1996). As such, a sudden appearance and increase of marine and brackish diatoms just below PL-b cannot be explained by eustatic sea-level change.”
Montaggioni et al., 2019 French Polynesia, +0.8 m higher than present
“The foundations of islets (motus), namely conglomerate platforms, started to form with deposition of patchy, rubble spreads over the upper reef-rim surfaces from ca 4,500 yr BP as sea level was about 0.80 m above its present mean level. On these platforms, islets started to accrete not before ca 2,300 yr BP, from isolated depocentres located midway between outer-reef and lagoon margins. At that time, sea level at about +0.60 m above present mean sea level was starting to slowly decrease to its present position.”
Brouwers et al., 2019  Dubai, +1.6 to 2.5 m higher than present
“During Pleistocene glaciations, global sea level was 100–120 m below the present level and resulted in most of the Arabian Gulf occurring as a dry basin (Purser 1973; Gunatilaka 1986) … Since late Pleistocene to early Holocene times, the sea level rose gradually until a maximum sea level stand 1.6– 2.5 m higher than today (Gunatilaka 1986).”
Haryono et al., 2019  Indonesia, +4.5 to 6 m higher than present
“[I]n 5000 BP, sea level increases up to +5 m from the present time; it means it was warmer than the present day. … Sealevel change started in 6,000 BP and rose to reach the highest sea level in 4,500-3,600 BP as +4.5 m above present sea level. Then moderate sea level lasted for 600-700 years until 2,200 BP reached +2.8 m. Low sea level peak occurred in 3,000 BP (+4.5 m above present sea level). Meanwhile, present sea level is lower than sea level peak during the middle period, that reached 2m above mean sea level. … Marine terrace also found in +6 m above present sea level.”

Williams et al., 2019 North Vietnam, +2 to 4 m higher than present
“A freshwater coastal marsh near the mouth of the Cam River in Northern Vietnam stands 2–3 m above mean sea level and is bordered by a coastal barrier that reaches about 6 m above mean sea level. A core from the marsh contains a 14-cm-thick sand and shell layer. The presence of abundant shell fragments suggests inland transport of littoral sediment, and the sand layer is tentatively identified as a washover deposit. The coast of the study area contains a beachrock standing above the modern beach and reaching to ∼4 m above mean sea level. A tentative explanation of this beachrock is that it represents a beach that formed during a mid-Holocene 2–3-m highstand, evidence for which has been reported from Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.”
Rivers et al., 2019  Northern Qatar, +1.6 m higher than present
“The Al Ruwais area of northern Qatar has been the site of shallow water carbonate sedimentation since the mid-Holocene. Two distinct depositional packages have been identified. Between ca 7000 and 1400 years ago, when sea-level was up to 1.6 m higher than today, a barrier/back-barrier system was active in an area immediately landward of the modern shoreline. During the same period, a laterally-continuous coral reef flourished in the open waters approximately 3 km to the north. Towards the end of this period sea-level fell to its current position, and the reefal system died, perhaps due to exposure or the influx of detrital sediment. Between 1400 and 800 years ago a new barrier island was established directly on top of the moribund reef, and the old barrier to the south was exposed to the meteoric realm. Over the past ca 800 years the new barrier has retreated landward as much as 1 km to its current position.”

Fachbereich, 2019  Antarctic Peninsula, +14.5 to 16 m higher than present
“Raised beaches along the coasts of Maxwell Bay, located at 7.5 to 4 m amsl (locally termed “6-m-beaches”), interfinger with terminal moraines of the last glacial-readvance (LGR), which occurred between 0.45 and 0.25 ka cal BP (John and Sugden, 1971; Sugden and John, 1973; Clapperton and Sugden, 1988; Yoon et al., 2004; Yoo et al., 2009; Simms et al., 2012). It is therefore likely that these beaches developed during the LGR (John and Sugden, 1971; Sugden and John, 1973; Hall 2010). Recent uplift of KGI was 0.4 mm a-1 during the last decade (Rülke et al., 2015). Average uplift during the entire Holocene, however, is 2.8 to 3 mm a-1 (Bentley et al., 2005; Fretwell et al., 2010). Fall of relative sea level on KGI accelerated during the last 500 years (Bentley et al., 2005, Hall, 2010; Watcham et al., 2011). This was most likely the result of a short-term acceleration in glacio-isostatic rebound after the LGR, with a modeled peak uplift rate of 12.5 mm a-1 between 1700 and 1840 CE (Simms et al., 2012). …  Bentley et al. (2005) show that an initial post-glacial sea-level fall was interrupted by a mid-Holocene highstand at about 14.5 to 16 m amsl from 5.8 to 3.0 ka cal BP. In contrast, data presented by Hall (2010) show a continuous sealevel fall, which becomes accelerated between 1.5 and 0.5 ka cal BP.”
Nirgi et al., 2019  Baltic Sea, +10 m higher than present (rate: +3.5 meters per century)
“Considering the elevations of the pre-Ancylus Lake palaeochannel sediments in the Pärnu site and the highest coastal landforms in the area, the water level rose at least 17.5 m at an average rate of 35 mm per year, which is 5–6 m more than proposed by earlier studies in this area (Rosentau et al., 2011; Veski et al., 2005). Similar fast transgression (40 mm/yr), about 21–22 m, has been documented inthe Blekinge area between 10.8 and 10.3 cal. ka BP (Hansson et al., 2018a). … At about 8.2–7.8 cal. Ka BP, the rising Litorina Sea flooded the palaeochannel in the Pärnu site and floodplain in Reiu at an elevation of 1–2 m b.s.l., around 7.6–7.8 cal. ka BP Rannametsa site at an elevation of 4 m a.s.l. and around 7.6–7.4 cal. ka BP Sindi BOM layer at an elevation of 7 m a.s.l. (Figure 7). The Litorina Sea reached its maximum transgressional RSL ca. 10 m a.s.l. [meters above present sea level] just after 7.6 cal. ka BP, most probably around 7.3 cal. ka BP (Veski et al., 2005), as also determined in Narva-Luga region at the south-eastern coast of Gulf of Finland (Rosentau et al., 2013). Thus, during the transgression, the sea level rose by about 14 m at an average rate of 12 mm per year.”

Rasmussen et al., 2019  Denmark, +3 m higher than present
“Full marine phase (c. 7700–3700 cal. a BP). – The appearance of a high salinity demanding fauna in this phase (several mollusc species, echinoids and Quinqueloculina seminulum) indicates a change to full marine conditions (Figs 4, 11). This marked environmental change coincides with a rapid and significant sea-level rise documented in both the Danish and the Baltic area dated to around 7600 cal. a BP (Fig. 11; Morner 1969; Christensen 1995, 1997; Yu et al. 2007; Lampe et al. 2011; Sander et al. 2015) and probably of global extent related to the so-called ‘global meltwater pulse 3’ documented in Caribbean-Atlantic coral sea-level records c. 7600 cal. a BP (Blanchon & Shaw 1995; Blanchon et al. 2002; Bird et al. 2010; Blanchon 2011a,b). Based on data from a recent study on the island of Samsø in the central Kattegat, Sander et al. (2015) estimated a relative sea-level rise of ~4.5 m between 7600 and 7200 cal. a BP. A high sea level in Aarhus Bay at this stage is supported by an almost complete absence of terrestrial plant macrofossils (Fig. 5) testifying to an increased distance between the core site and the shore. … In the period of greatly increased sedimentation (c. 7700–6300 cal. a BP), the average rate is ~2.8 mm a1 (Fig. 11). The extensive coastal erosion during this sea-level highstand period is manifested in today’s landscape in the form of numerous fossil coastal cliffs situated above present-day sea level that formed during the Mid-Holocene when the relative sea level was ~3 m higher than present along the coasts of the Aarhus Bay area (Mertz 1924). … In a study of the island of Anholt in the central part of the Kattegat, the drop in absolute sea level was estimated to 2.6 m over a 700-year period between 4300 and 3600 cal. a BP (with most of the sea-level fall taking place between 4250 and 3740 cal. aBP; Clemmensenet al. 2012).”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his rally in Hershey, Pennsylvania, President Donald Trump was at the top of his game, doing what he does best: trolling his floundering opponents. The US president is ripping his Democrat rivals like a lion mauling hyenas.
At his Hershey speech, 31:00 mark video below, Trump brings up the climate and energy issue, ridiculing wind energy and alarmist climate science just as COP25 takes place in Madrid amid declarations of a state of emergency in Europe and pledges to go carbon neutral.

“You’d have windmills all over the place if you had Crooked Hillary. They’d be knocking off birds left and right,” said Trump before a packed crowd.
President sees through global warming sham
“Darling, I wanna watch television tonight, and there’s no damn wind. What do I do?” Trump mocked wind energy before a laughing audience, who applauded enthusiastically. Trump even imitated the noisy, unreliable contraptions that litter the landscape.
“I wanna watch the election results. Darling, there’s no wind, the damn wind just isn’t blowing like it used to because of global warming, I think,” Trump mocked. “I think it’s global warming. Global warming – no more wind. No more life!”
The President then trolled the climate alarmists, sarcastically warning: “The oceans are gonna rise an eighth of an inch within the next 250 years,” said Trump, feigning breathlessness. “We’re gonna be wiped out!”
“Clean air, clean water”
The President then conveyed to the audience that the focus needs to be on clean air and clean water, and without shutting down industries and causing job losses.

"It’s well known that carbon in the atmosphere is causing global warming. What is less well known, outside of scientific circles at least, is the role oceans have to play in this. Our seas contain 60 times more carbon than the atmosphere, and they can release it at sufficiently rapid rates to cause dramatic changes in the climate. In fact, as we describe in research published in Nature, CO2 released by the oceans brought about the end of the last ice age. More than 50 million cubic kilometres of ice once covered North America and Scandinavia. It melted away between approximately 19,000 and 10,000 years ago, releasing enough water to raise the sea level by about 130 metres. This came after CO2 concentrations increased by approximately 50%, from 180 to 280 parts per million between the last ice age and the current interglacial period. To explain such a pronounced increase, we have to look at the ocean. Scientists have thought for a long time that the southern sectors of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, a region known as the Southern Ocean, may be key to explaining the increase in atmospheric CO2.  Large volumes of deep water loaded with carbon come to the surface in this area. However, the low concentration of certain nutrients (for example iron) in surface waters limits the metabolism of planktonic organisms, which cannot fully consume all the carbon brought to the surface ocean, resulting in CO2 being “outgassed” to the atmosphere. We wanted to assess if the ocean contributed to the atmospheric CO2 increase during the last deglaciation, so it made sense to look at areas that are important today for the ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon: the Atlantic Sector of the Southern Ocean and the Eastern Equatorial Pacific, another area where deep, cold water rises to the surface. But how can we then go back in time and check if these areas were a source of CO2 in the atmosphere? The answer is buried a few thousand meters below the surface of the oceans.  Research vessels such as the Joides Resolution are capable of drilling the sea floor to recover long sequences of sediments in which the history of the oceans is recorded. The sediments contain, among other things, fossils of tiny organisms that once lived in the upper ocean, called foraminifera. These creatures build chalky shells, and the waters they live in influence their chemical composition. After death, the shells sink to the bottom of the oceans, where they accumulate. We analysed the sediment cores and looked for the isotopic composition of the element boron present in shells that lived during particular times of interest. Boron tells us pH levels of the waters, which in turn tells us about carbon levels: a high concentration of CO2 in the waters will make them more acidic (lower pH), and vice versa. We found a link. When the glaciers of the last ice age were melting, and the atmospheric CO2 was increasing, the surface waters of the Southern Ocean and the Eastern Equatorial Pacific were also more acidic. This signalled an increased concentration of CO2 – much higher than those in the atmosphere.  This is the key finding of our research: the ocean was a source of CO2 to the atmosphere during key intervals of the last deglaciation, which explains the large increase in CO2 concentrations. It’s the next obvious question. Previous research has found that the last ice age saw much less carbon exchanged between ocean and atmosphere than we see today, mostly because the Southern Ocean was intensely stratified at the time and deep waters rarely made it to the surface. Nutrients and CO2 were accumulating in the deep Southern Ocean, due to the decay of the organic matter that was being produced in the surface ocean and transported to the abyss.  During the deglaciation, the effective communication between deep and upper ocean was re-established, and this carbon “reservoir” was leaked to the atmosphere. Since the beginning of the industrial revolution the oceans have absorbed an estimated 155 billion tonnes of carbon, about 30% of the total human emissions. The present atmospheric CO2 concentrations, approximately 400 parts per million, have not been seen on Earth since the Pliocene, around 3 million years ago, and the rate of increase is unprecedented in the period of on-off glaciers we have had since. Humanity is performing a large scale experiment with the Earth, and the consequences are already being seen in the form of increased atmospheric and oceanic temperatures, raising sea levels and ocean acidification, to name a few. How the oceanic uptake of CO2 is going to operate in the future remains unknown, but studies like ours advance our understanding of how the ocean works to store and release carbon on timescales of millennia and that therefore are way beyond the reach of the instrumental record."

Irregardless of our political situation at home, our troops overseas and their families, always deserve the best support we can provide. For the past two years, this event gave comfort to many local families whose loved ones are serving overseas in the cause of freedom. Thanks to a great outpouring of community support, it was hugely successful. This yearâs event promises to be even better.
While the sacrifice of the men and women in our nationâs armed forces is clear, what many in our community donât know is that families of our servicemen and service women suffer even beyond the separation and the worry. Many families lose their breadwinner, and often take a large pay cut in service to our country. Sometimes it takes months for military pay to even be received as training, locations, and deployments change, leaving families to subsist on savings, borrowings, and kindness. Some families find themselves behind in rent, or leaving important bills unpaid while their loved ones selflessly serve our country.
Proceeds of this event will replenish an assistance fund used to help local military families in their time of need.
It also will provide entertainment, moral support, and inspiration. Most importantly it will provide cheer and personal contact via an Internet Video Conferencing System that will allow our troops stationed overseas to see, hear, and interact with their loved ones left behind.
On behalf of our local military families, and the members of the Chico National Guard, I ask for your support.
You can support our troops 3 ways:
1. Buy tickets to the event
2. Make a donation of goods and services for the silent auction
3. Make a cash donation.
Details are below.  Thank you for your consideration. Anthony

"This article is part of The Conversation’s worldwide series on the Future of Nuclear. You can read the rest of the series here. Nuclear power has had a makeover. What was once seen as a futuristic source of limitless energy has been reframed as a response to global warming, an ideal solution for countries looking for a continuous source of low-carbon power. But who are these countries? At the moment 31 different nations operate nuclear power plants (see page 14 here, with a total of 388 reactors, and before Fukushima, most planned nuclear power plant projects were in Asia and Eastern Europe, extending a trend from earlier years. Industry lobbyists the World Nuclear Association suggests that nuclear power capacity worldwide is increasing steadily, with more than 60 reactors under construction in 13 countries. They say that eight countries are either planning to build for the first time (Belarus and United Arab Emirates), have signed contracts (Lithuania and Turkey), or have some plans to build (Bangladesh, Jordan, Poland, and Vietnam). In contrast, the more independent World Nuclear Industry Status Report describes a declining trend, with annual nuclear electricity generation reaching a maximum of 266 GW in 2006 and dropping to 235 GW in 2013 – with 50 fewer operating reactors than the peak in 2002, and total installed capacity comparable to levels last seen two decades ago. This decline is also confirmed in BP’s recent Energy Outlook. In terms of new build, 67 reactors are under construction worldwide with a total capacity of 64 GW. For the nuclear industry this at first sounds promising, but then “under construction” doesn’t necessarily mean it will be finished any time soon – work first began on one reactor opened in Argentina last year back in 1981. It’s true to say that the risk to people, the environment and to the future of nuclear energy from another major incident is still very real, and reactor accidents from “beyond design-base” cascading events, such as the Fukushima disaster and all other major nuclear accidents, are the single largest financial risk – far outweighing the combined effect of market, credit, construction and operational risks. The thing is, in trying to “design out” these accidents, reactors have become much more expensive, complex, and hence, difficult to build on time and on budget.   Of the 67 currently being built, eight reactors have been under construction for more than 20 years, another for 12 years; and at least 49 have significant delays. For the remaining 18 reactor units, either construction began within the past five years or the reactors haven’t reached projected start-up dates, with construction projects in Finland and France very many years behind schedule. Average construction times are increasing: The Russian state nuclear corporation Rosatom is building in Russia, China, and Belarus, and claims more than 20 export reactor orders in Iran, Turkey, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Jordan, Hungary, Finland, Egypt, India and South Africa. But there are questions about whether it’s got the finances and supply chain resources to carry out more than a small fraction of these – most depend on Russian finance, hit hard by the recent downturn, and Rosatom is already facing delays in its homeland due to lack of resources. Meanwhile, the World Nuclear Status Report shows that China has 28 reactors under construction – 42% of the world’s total new-build - with 21 reactors (17 GW) in operation, which in 2013 provided 2.1% of the country’s electricity. If all their reactors under construction come online before 2020, this would bring the total to 49 reactors. To put this into perspective, in 2013 alone, China installed 12 GW of solar, a threefold increase over 2012. And recent events have challenged China’s plans for nuclear. There’s been the usual construction delays, cost increases, doubts over the siting of reactors in provinces inland, and questions over safety and regulatory oversight  – and, remarkably, just last month, significant faults were found in the reactor pressure vessels already installed in the Areva EPRs at Taishan 1 and 2. While nuclear carries very real technical and regulatory risk – construction cost represents a key challenge. New builds will only go ahead after government guarantees public subsidies, including long-term power purchase agreements. This is because the private sector can’t afford to build new nuclear plants themselves. The reality is that nuclear new builds are high-value, high-risk projects with a marked tendency for significant delay and delay claims, cost growth and investor risk. For example, in Finland, their nuclear corporation TVO is pressing a €2.7 billion compensation claim for delays to the Olkiluoto EPR nuclear power plant. Perhaps amusingly, the French nuclear corporation Areva is in turn demanding €3.5 billion from TVO. The project’s turn-key price was €3 billion in 2005 and the current estimated price stands at €8.5 billion, with a construction time of 13 years and rising. And just recently, TVO has dashed Areva hopes of building any more EPRs in Finland. So the general post-Fukushima situation in the EU implies there will be limited construction in the coming decade. Although new builds are still planned in Finland, France and the UK - Italy and Switzerland have cancelled plans for new reactors, Belgium has confirmed a nuclear phase-out, and eight EU countries have signed a declaration that nuclear power is incompatible with the concept of sustainable development. At the heart of the nuclear question are differing views on value for money, foresight and responsibility. Huge long-term investments are needed and it’s clear there are critical social, environmental and economic decisions to be made. Germany, Europe’s dominant electricity user, has made its choice. Its decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022 and to instead invest in renewables, efficiency measures, grid infrastructure and energy storage, will prove significant for both European and international energy policy."
"“Snowmageddon” was predicted – three feet of snow, blizzards whipped up by high winds, a freeze of the whole transport system. What New York got was “snowperbole”.  Yes, it snowed, but not as badly as predicted, and many people have been left wondering why the city was effectively shut down for what was, in New York terms, a light dusting. So what happened? The blame game began immediately. Some meteorologists have already put their hands up. “My deepest apologies to many key decision makers and so many members of the general public” said the National Weather Service’s Gary Szatkowski, on Twitter. The politicians have defended their actions, with New York mayor Bill de Blasio saying the city shutdown was the sensible choice, given the potential for damage and loss of life. He said “we made the decision, better safe than sorry.” Is this a “forecast bust” or a case of expectations exceeding capabilities? Clearly people are not satisfied with the system. But is there anything that can be done to reduce such problems in the future? The answer, of course, is complicated. If you want to study how society could better respond to extreme weather, you need the help of political scientists, behavioural psychologists, media analysts, communication designers, town planners, engineers – and perhaps even some meteorologists. We will need time and in-depth research to assess precisely what happened in this event, but, on the face of it, the National Weather Service forecast was actually pretty good. Yes, they were predicting a chance of very high snowfall, which failed to materialise so dramatically over New York City. But Long Island and other parts of the north-east were badly hit, as predicted. Snow depth is one of the hardest aspects of weather to forecast, and the old saying of “too cold to snow” has some truth behind it. There can be a very fine line between conditions warm and moist enough to bring lots of snow, those which bring only some, and those which mean rain.  It’s also very hard to see in advance just how extreme the level of precipitation might be. We can very often say that the conditions will be right to cause a lot of rain or snow, but knowing whether a storm system will bring three inches of rain or five – or a foot of snow or three – is much more difficult. But this critical in terms of planned response. Five inches of rain might cause dramatic flooding, whereas two inches is just a normal shower. In New York, three feet of snow might cause snowmageddon. Less than a foot? Well, that’s just snow. Weather forecasting has made enormous advances. A forecast of the quality and accuracy provided by the National Weather Service this week would have been unthinkable 20 years ago. But as we have advanced we have realised more and more that we can only think of forecasts in terms of probabilities. The essence of extreme events is that, by definition, they are rare at a given location; conditions have to combine in just the right way to give us the worst case scenario. Otherwise, we just get “severe but typical”, for which we’re usually quite well prepared. Advanced predictions of the most extreme winds or rain will always see significant uncertainty. The paradox of extreme events is that it is impossible to judge the accuracy of a forecast from a one off; we need enormous amounts of computer power not just to make the forecast, but to evaluate and improve the reliability of the forecast by studying past events. Some have called for New York to be given a special high-powered supercomputer to help make more accurate predictions in future.  More processing power might well have helped in this case, but computers are not the answer to everything. Improved observations are just as important – larger numbers of measurements, provided with greater accuracy, from weather stations, radars, satellites, aircraft and elsewhere. But we also need a greater understanding of how best to use these observations and, perhaps first and foremost, a deeper understanding of the weather processes themselves. This is the “science behind the weather” that keeps me busy. It is important to realise that there is still lots about how weather works that we just don’t understand. Even where we do have a good understanding, we need to simplify things so that our computers are capable of processing all the information we have in time to make a useful forecast.  Some computer programs are so complex they take days or even weeks to model a single cloud. That’s not much use to forecasters who have to make a prediction now, about tomorrow’s weather, for a whole city, state or country. Extreme weather warnings are crucial and can save lives, but it’s important that neither scientists nor politicians promise things they can’t deliver. In a way, forecasters are victims of their own success, by raising people’s expectations of their abilities.  Any ambitious forecast system will have false alarms. Imagine, for example, an extreme storm that might occur only once in a hundred years – about 0.0027% chance on any given day or 0.01% if we restrict ourselves to winter months. Forecasting a 10% probability of this storm would be an incredibly impressive achievement. However nine times out of ten such a forecast will be perceived as “wrong” (though it may be, on its own terms, a perfect forecast).  While false alarms might be expensive, and lead to the danger that people don’t pay heed to the next one (“crying wolf”), it’s better to be safe than sorry. Response must be weighed against both the severity of the event and its likelihood. Authorities must learn how to make the most objective and rational decisions (which they may well have done in this case) while the public need to understand that “we acted on the best information available” does not mean “we got it wrong”."

A few years ago, a chironomid reconstruction of Boothia Peninsula in the Canadian Arctic (Fortin and Gajewski, 2016) revealed not only were today’s temperatures the coldest of the last 7000 years, but the last 150 years “do not indicate a warming during this time.”

The Canadian Arctic’s Baffin Island had 5°C warmer summer temperatures between 10,000 and 8000 years ago (Ilyashuk et al., 2011). Somehow the polar bears managed to survive this sea-ice-free period.

Image Source: Ilyashuk et al., 2011
Earlier this year, another Canadian Arctic reconstruction (Bajolle et al., 2019) was published indicating temperatures were about 2-4.5°C warmer than today throughout the last 8500 years. Only 3 records mark temperatures colder than they are now.

Multiple news sites are reporting that 
levels of the second most important greenhouse gas, methane, have stabilized.
From Scientific American: ""During the two decades of measurements, methane
underwent double-digit growth as a constituent of our atmosphere, rising from
1,520 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) in 1978 to 1,767 ppbv in 1998. But the
most recent measurements have revealed that methane levels are barely rising
anymore — and it is unclear why.""
From NewScientist: ""Although tis is good news,  it does not mean that methane levels will not rise again, and that carbon dioxide remains the 800-pound gorilla of climate change.""
Actually, NewScientist is wrong. CO2 is not the biggest ""gorilla"" of
greenhouse gas on planet earth. It’s water vapor. Our earth would be much colder without water vapor in the atmosphere…it would be much like Mars.
So many of the climate models focus solely on CO2, but they leave out water vapor in the equations, or assume its ""static"".
CO2 is far from being the most potent greenhouse gas. Chloroflourocarbons
(CFC’s) commonly used as refrigerants as far worse at trapping infra-red in our
atmosphere.
Of naturally created GHG’s, Methane is 23 times more effective at warming the
atmosphere than CO2. Nitrous Oxide is even worse at 296. So far no emergency
legislation has been authored to eliminate the effect of cows or dental
surgeons. The Kyoto treaty does not address these other gases either.
Global Warming Potentials 
(100 Year Time Horizon) 
GAS GWP 
========================
Carbon dioxide (CO2) 1 
Methane (CH4) 23 
Nitrous oxide (N2O) 296 
Hydrofluorocarbons 
HFC-23 12,000 
HFC-125 3,400 
HFC-134a 1,300 
HFC-143a 4,300 
HFC-152a 120 
HFC-227ea 3,500 
HFC-43-10mee 1,500 
Fully Fluorinated Gases 
SF6 22,200 
CF4 5,700 
C2F6 11,900 
C4F10 8,600 
C6F14 9,000 
The concept of the global warming potential (GWP) was developed to compare the
ability of each greenhouse gas to trap heat in the atmosphere relative to
another gas. In this case, CO2 is the reference gas. Methane, for example, has a
GWP of 23 over a 100-year period. This means that on a kilogram for kilogram
basis, methane is 23 times more potent than CO2 over a 100-year period.
The interesting thing here is that this stabilization of methane levels in
our atmosphere happened all by itself, and the scientists are clearly baffled as
to an explanation. As I’ve always said, the earth’s atmosphere is such a complex
system, that pinning its change on just one thing is not good science.

"The stunning colours of coral attract many divers to the world’s reefs but, for us coral scientists, one mystery has always remained. Swimming over a reef, you can frequently spot brightly coloured coral sat next to differently coloured or colourless individuals of the same species. Why such variation in the same environment? We now have the answer. Our research at the Coral Reef Laboratory at the University of Southampton lets coral colours appear in a new light: as sunscreening pigments that help explain how corals adapt to environmental stress. Our findings are published in the journal Molecular Ecology. The underlying ecological concept may not be restricted to pigments in corals but might help to explain how species respond to changes in environmental conditions. Answers to these questions are urgently required in times of global change and alarming species extinction rates. The brownish appearances of many corals under daylight is due to photosynthetic pigments from the microscopically small plants that live in symbiotic partnership within them. But most of the green, red and purple-blue hues are caused by a family of Nobel prize-winning protein pigments. Some coral pigments glow green or red under ultra-violet or blue light, a physical phenomenon called fluorescence. During this process, light of a distinct colour is taken up by certain dye particles and re-emitted with a different, more red-shifted colour. The same process is responsible for the neon colours of marker pens or high-visibility clothing. In shallow waters the pink, purple and blue coral colours are most striking. Beyond depths of around seven metres these colours tend to become dull since their brilliance depends on the reflection of red light. Down there, where blue light dominates, the green and red fluorescence of some corals makes them stand out from the bluish-grey background.  Fluorescence can be best observed with the help of blue light torches and special filter masks under low light conditions. Using this equipment, the glowing corals make a night dive a psychedelic adventure. Some corals increase the production of colourful protein pigments when they are exposed to more intense sunlight. Humans get a sun tan – corals become more colourful. We found the pink and purple proteins act as sunscreens for the corals by removing substantial light components that might otherwise become harmful to the algae hosted in their tissue. Corals rely on these light-dependent miniature plants, the so-called zooxanthellae, since they provide a substantial amount of food.  We have also explained why some corals accumulate exceptionally high amounts of  colourful pigments in growing areas such as branch tips or near wounds. These areas contain essentially no symbiotic algae, so much of the light is reflected by the white coral skeleton instead of being used by the algae.  The resulting increased light intensities in the new parts of the coral represent a potential danger for the algal cells that need to colonise these areas. Hence, it seems the corals use a clever trick to help their symbionts. The higher light intensity switches on the genes that are responsible for the production of the sun-screening pigments.  Our results suggest that this shading effect could help the algae to enter the new tissue and establish the necessary symbiotic association. Once the population of symbiotic algae is fully established, the light levels in the tissue decrease as the algae use most of the incident light for photosynthesis. As a consequence, the genes of the chromoproteins are switched off again, allowing the coral to save the energy required for their production. Increased growth is associated with wound healing and neutralising potentially dangerous organisms by overgrowing them. The growth-related increase in pigmentation can also explain the bright colours of corals in areas where the animals have been damaged or are struggling with other organisms settling on their surface or in their skeleton. Despite these recent advances in understanding the functions of coral pigments, we still didn’t know why corals of the same species could display such different colours, even when sat next to each other. It raises challenging questions. If the production of the pigments is triggered by the light intensity, then why don’t all individuals have the same colours when they are exposed to the same light environment? And if these pigments help survival by acting as a sunscreen, then why aren’t corals in shallow waters always colourful?  Our most recent publication  explains the genetic framework that results in the dramatic differences in coral individuals. We found that instead of using a single gene to control the production of sunscreening pigments, corals use multiple copies of the same gene.  These genes do indeed respond to light, but not all of them, thus it is the number of these active genes that is important – and this varies between individual corals of the same species. Depending on how many genes are active, the individual coral will become more or less colourful, even despite being exposed to the same light conditions.  However, the enhanced protection offered by the sunscreening pigments costs the corals a lot of energy that might be diverted away from growth or reproduction. Therefore, being brightly coloured might not be a good investment for corals settling in more shady parts of the reefs. This genetic variation ensures some individuals within a coral population are well protected and are likely to survive better in stressful environments. Others are less protected but can instead invest their energy in processes that could help them to succeed in habitats with less light stress. These are probably the driving forces that keep multiple colour variants in the game for survival.  The resulting colour polymorphism makes it easier for coral species to inhabit more ecological niches in a reef. Humans can support the efforts of the corals by sheltering them from other forms of stress that they might not be able to deal with by themselves: heated waters, pollution, nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, overfishing, to name only some."
"Antarctica’s glaciers have been making headlines during the past year, and not in a good way. Whether it’s a massive ice shelf facing imminent risk of collapse, glaciers in the West Antarctic past the point of no return, or new threats to East Antarctic ice, it’s all been rather gloomy. And now I’m afraid there’s more bad news: a new study published in the journal Science, led by a team of my colleagues and I from the University of Bristol, has observed a sudden increase of ice loss in a previously stable part of Antarctica. The region in question is the southernmost half of the Antarctic Peninsula, a section of the mainland which extends 1300km into the Southern Ocean. Its northern half is the continent’s mildest region and the climate effects there are clear. We already knew for instance that the glaciers of the Northern Antarctic Peninsula were in trouble following the disintegration of some of its ice shelves, most famously Larsen A and B.  Further to the west, the massive glaciers feeding into the Amundsen Sea have been shedding ice into the ocean at an alarming rate for decades. Out of the blue, the Southern Peninsula filled up the gap between these two regions and became Antarctica’s second largest contributor to sea level rise. Using satellite elevation measurements, we found the Southern Antarctic Peninsula showed no signs of change up to 2009.  Around that year, multiple glaciers along a vast 750km coastline suddenly started to shed ice into the ocean at a nearly constant rate of 60 cubic km, or about 55 trillion litres of water, each year – enough water to fill 350,000 Empire State Buildings over the past five years. Some of the glaciers are currently thinning by as much as 4 metres each year. The ice loss in the region is so large that it causes small changes in the Earth’s gravity field, which can be detected by another satellite mission, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). The answer is both yes and no. Data from an Antarctic climate model shows that the sudden change cannot be explained by changes in snowfall or air temperature.  Instead, we attribute the rapid ice loss to warming oceans. Many of the glaciers in the region feed into ice shelves that float on the surface of the ocean.  They act as a buttress to the ice resting on bedrock inland, slowing down the flow of the glaciers into the ocean.  The westerly winds that encircle Antarctica have become more vigorous in recent decades, in response to climate warming and ozone depletion.  The stronger winds push warm waters from the Southern Ocean poleward, where they eat away at the glaciers and floating ice shelves from below. Ice shelves in the region have lost almost one-fifth of their thickness in the last two decades, thereby reducing the resisting force on the glaciers. A key concern is that much of the ice of the Southern Antarctic Peninsula is grounded on bedrock below sea level, which gets deeper inland.  This means that even if the glaciers retreat, the warm water will chase them inland and melt them even more. The region’s melting glaciers are currently adding about 0.16 millimetres to global sea levels per year, which won’t immediately make you run for the hills. But it’s yet another source of sea level rise, about 5% of the global total increase. What might be a bigger source of concern is that the changes occurred so suddenly and in an area that was behaving quietly until now. The fact that so many glaciers in such a large region suddenly started to lose ice came as a surprise. It shows a very fast response of the ice sheet: in just a few years everything changed. The Southern Antarctic Peninsula contains enough ice to add 35 cm to sea level, but that won’t happen any time soon. It’s too early to tell how much longer the ice loss will continue and how much it will contribute to future sea level rise. For this, a detailed knowledge of the geometry of the local ice shelves, the ocean floor topography, ice sheet thickness and glacier flow speeds are crucial.  But the ice on Antarctica is like a sleeping giant. Even if we would stop emitting greenhouse gases as of today, or the inflow of warm water would stop, this inert system would take a long time to find an equilibrium again."

Share this...FacebookTwitterScientists find three Arctic (Svalbard) lakes were all ~7°C warmer than they are now about 10,000 years ago – when CO2 concentrations were only 260 ppm.
According to a just-published Geophysical Research Letters paper (van der Bilt et al., 2019), not only were surface temperatures 7°C warmer than today in High Arctic Svalbard due to the accompanying “high radiative forcing” during the Early Holocene, but sea ice limits were well north of the study area back then too.
The authors point out that model “simulations neither reproduce this reconstructed pattern nor its magnitude.” This is presumably because the model simulations are predicated on the assumption CO2 concentrations are a primary climate driver.

This paper is yet another in a “growing body of recent work” that uses the prevalence of warmth-demanding (thermophilious) species present in Arctic locations to reconstruct regional temperatures based on a requisite warmth limit for the species’ survival.
Earlier this year Leopold et al., 2019 assessed temperatures were 5-8°C warmer than today in Arctic Svalbard 8 to 10 thousand years ago due to the presence of Mytilus spp, a warmth-loving mussel.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWinter has not even officially arrived, but already large areas of the northern hemisphere are seeing “historic snowfalls”, frigid temperatures and even avalanche alarms.
The Northern Hemisphere has certainly caught a major cold, one certainly not caused by the human CO2 virus. Instead of fever, parts of the northern hemisphere are in hypothermia!
Alarmists, media desperate
Though global warming scientists will never admit it, they are really surprised and stunned. All that is left for them is to make up some cockamamie warming-causes-cold explanations and hope there are enough severely stupid among the media and masses to believe it.
“United States — Rewrite the Record Books”
Beginning in North America, “sub-zero temperatures are now blasting” millions of Americans following “the three historic snowstorms which buried parts of the U.S. last month,” reports weather site electroverse.net here.
Electroverse writes that “lows throughout the week will be more like January temperatures” with readings below zero for many U.S. states and “temps down into the teens are even forecast as far south as Texas.” Yesterday, 97 records toppled.
“It’s a big deal,” Electroverse writes in its headline.
Solar activity suspected
It’s not the sort of thing we are supposed to be expecting from a “warming planet”.  Some climate experts blame natural factors, like solar activity, for the cold, and that these warnings have long been known since the sun has entered a new period of calm.
Freeze watches and warnings also extend as far south as Florida. And it’s only early November. And don’t expect to see many FFF activists to show up at rallies protesting hot weather any time soon.
Polar Bear Science site here also reports that the Hudson Bay in Canada has started freezing up earlier than normal three years in a row!
Europe starting to get clobbered by snow, 2m in Alps
Meanwhile cold has also spread across Europe, though not quite as brutal as what we’ve been seeing across North America.

In central Europe, the Austrian online heute here reports that “huge amounts of snow” are on the way for the Alps. German site Wetteronline.de reports here of “new, severe snowfalls in the Alps” with “up to two meters of fresh snow are possible in places up to the weekend” in Switzerland, Austria and Northern Italy, “This is good news for winter sports enthusiasts – but the danger of avalanches is increasing.”
Biggest November snowstorm in 40 years
Even global warming child activist Greta Thunberg’s Sweden is getting hard hit by extreme cold and snow. Electroverse reports the Nordic country is suffering “its biggest November snow storm in 40 years.”
On November 10th, Mika tweeted that temps in northern Sweden fell 10 -34.5°C.

Today is the coldest morning so far during the ongoing winter season:
-34.5°C in Sweden, -31.1°C in Norway and -30.6°C in Finland (not shown on the map). pic.twitter.com/PoH2Ddnde4

Most snow in 60 years
The German Ruhrkultur site reports how also Finland just saw “the coldest autumn temperature and the highest snow depth in at least 60 years” and that ” the temperature in Enontekiö, a municipality in Finnish Lapland, dropped to 28.2°C on Tuesday 5 November.”
Deepening cold across Siberia as well
“On November 11 in Yakutia, the daily temperature never rose above −30°C (-22F),” reported SOTT site here. “Some parts of Siberia were even colder: In Evenkia and the northern regions of the Krasnoyarsk Territory, the temperature dropped to −41 … −44°C.”

SOTT comments (sarcastically): “I wonder how much ice will melt at −44°C (-47F).
With all the early winter weather, it’s ridiculous to claim the globe is burning up. So it’s no wonder the alarmists have taken their climate ambulance to the far side of the globe, NSW Australia, and kept their narrow focus on brush fires.

"It has been almost 10 years since BP was mired in the largest marine oil spill in history, following the explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2010 Bob Dudley was the man tasked with steering the group back from the brink of collapse as compensation payouts threatened to suffocate the business. A decade on, Dudley’s successor will now have to navigate an environmental crisis on a global scale.  Bernard Looney becomes BP’s new chief executive next month at a time of mounting public pressure to prevent a climate breakdown by phasing out fossil fuels. His career success has been built on the millions of barrels of oil that BP produces every day, but his tenure at the helm will be defined by his response to the climate crisis. The dapper, 49-year-old Irishman has been hailed as a charismatic moderniser of the oil industry for the millennial generation. This week he launched an Instagram account to encourage a “candid” conversation about the energy transition. Many believe this unconventional oil man may be BP’s best hope of surviving the global shift from fossil fuels. Sources within the company say Looney was the natural frontrunner in the race to take over from Dudley. “It was no surprise to me whatsoever,” says one. “This is a business which needs to continue to deliver on its promises to shareholders, but must also evolve. The new leader will need to do both, and for many Bernard was the natural choice.” So, how “green” is BP’s new chief executive? “It’s a legitimate question,” says Mark Lewis, head of sustainability at the asset management arm of French investment bank BNP Paribas. “The burden of truth will rest firmly on his shoulders.” He adds: “In Europe’s financial centres the sense is that BP may be the European major with the most work to do in terms of improving their reputation and performance on climate change. I think Mr Looney will find that this is the first and most important question that he will need to give reassurance on.” Looney is a BP “lifer”. He was marked as a rising star soon after joining as an engineering graduate from University College Dublin, and primed for senior leadership. A series of plum apprentice roles beside BP bosses followed, including stints working directly for John Browne and Tony Hayward. When Dudley took the reins in 2010 he promoted Looney to BP’s senior management team. Looney later became the global boss of “upstream” oil and gas production, where he was in charge of reigniting the company’s fossil fuel growth. Under his leadership BP produced 2.6 million barrels of oil and gas every day, and secured a series of multibillion-dollar investments that will pour millions more barrels into the global market in the years ahead. Mark van Baal, from the Dutch shareholder activist group Follow This, warns that a career steeped in oil reserves may make it difficult for Looney to “imagine a future beyond oil and gas” or see renewables “as a business opportunity not a chore”. However, Nick Boyle, the chief executive of BP’s solar joint venture Lightsource BP, says he has “absolutely no doubt” about BP’s commitment to developing renewable energy. Boyle teamed up with BP two years ago and has met Looney twice in recent months. “He was genuinely interested and asking intelligent questions about challenges and what we thought the future would be for solar. We know from any of the energy projections available that solar is going to play an ever increasing part in the energy mix, and part of BP,” he says. Still, the oil bosses who have led the most meaningful climate action have tended to be new arrivals to the industry. The Danish energy giant Orsted has traded oil rigs for offshore windfarms under the leadership of Henrik Poulsen, a former telecoms boss who was once an executive at Lego. Spain’s Repsol set out industry-leading plans to emerge as a carbon- neutral company by 2050, mapped by its chief executive, Josu Jon Imaz, after a career in politics and scientific academia. Looney intends to be the exception. In an industry speech shortly before he was named as BP’s new boss, he told delegates: “We need to listen, hard, to society’s concerns. They are real concerns – the world is not on a sustainable path – and they are our concerns. Shouting louder about the good that we do is not a winning strategy. We need to demonstrate that we are part of the solution – that we get it.” He is reportedly poised to unveil the biggest strategic overhaul of the company’s century-long history. According to Reuters, the plan is to broaden BP’s carbon targets beyond the emissions it produces within its operations to include the emissions from the product it sells to customers. Environmental campaigners believe this would be a crucial step, an essential means of pushing oil companies into providing cleaner sources of energy. “Maybe it’s the Irish thing,” Boyle adds. “But he instils a confidence and a positive, can-do mentality which is infectious. It’s a big company, but he’s always been well-known as a charismatic, lead-from-the-front, roll-your-sleeves-up type of guy. The big plus with Bernard is that he gets it.” BP’s chances of surviving beyond its next environmental crisis will depend on that. Activist investors say oil firms must: Cut their own emissionsOil companies can do a lot to reduce CO2 emitted during production – by, for example, cutting methane leaks from rigs and stopping “flaring” – the burning of “waste” gas from oilfields. Take responsibility for the carbon footprint of the energy they sellOutgoing boss Bob Dudley stated that BP “cannot control” how people choose to drive or heat their homes, but setting an emissions target for the energy they produce should help a shift towards clean sources. Set a clear strategy for hitting the Paris climate goalsTo achieve net zero emissions by 2050, oil companies also need to invest in measures such as tree planting and carbon capture. Link executive pay to climate actionThis would incentivise leaders and guard against “greenwash” promises."
"It’s bee season and now’s the time to go outside and observe these popular insects. Bees hold a relatively special place in people’s affections – we have them to thank for honey, of course, and they’re also essential pollinators of many food crops and wild plants. But most bees aren’t the snazzy hive-dwelling orange and black characters we know so well. In fact, there are around 20,000 species of bee globally and just seven of these are honeybees, and the vast majority of honeybee colonies belong to only one species: Apis mellifera.  So what about the rest? Well around 250 species are bumblebees, these big fluffy garden favourites are closely related to honeybees and also live socially with a queen and workers. But this still leaves us with around 19,700 bee species to account for. Indeed there are so many of them that the vast majority don’t even have a common English name and we have to use the scientific name.  Most of these remaining species are solitary; unlike social bees they do not have queens or workers, all females are reproductive and live independently. These solitary bees are important pollinators and have evolved all sorts of interesting characteristics more suited to a life flying solo. Lots of wild bees nest below ground. Some, like the tawny mining bee, Andrena fulva, often leave very noticeable nest entrances in lawns and parks, while other species such as Lasioglossum malachurum can be found nesting in the compacted ground of footpaths – keep a look out for tiny circular holes the next time you’re walking on a footpath, occasionally you can see the little face of the occupant. Some species of wild bees nest in vegetation, such as Ceratina cyanea which sets up in the hollow stems of plants like brambles. Leaf-cutter bees like Megachile centuncularis cut out neat circular sections from leaves and use those to line the cells of their nests which are usually in timber or wall cavities. One of the more unusual nesting strategies is that of Osmia bicolor, the females of this species nest in abandoned snail shells. They even go as far as to cover the shells with vegetation to hide them from view of predators and parasites.  A close relative of this species is O. bicornis aka the red mason bee, this is a very familiar garden visitor across Europe and Asia due to its habit of nesting in the brickwork of our homes. If you look closely at the females you will notice two small horns on the front of its face (this is the inspiration for the scientific name “bicornis”), they use these horns like trowels to position mud they have collected to seal their nests. Adult bees usually only feed on nectar, they have finished growing so they just need sufficient energy and there’s no better energy drink for them than sugary nectar. Their larvae however need protein to grow and develop, so female solitary bees collect pollen from flowers and place a big ball of it in each nest cell before laying an egg and sealing the cell. All bees are generalists in terms of the flowers they take nectar from, but some species will only take pollen from a small number of plant species. Macropis europaea is an unusual bee. It is monolectic, which means it only collects pollen from one species of plant: yellow loosestrife. It doesn’t just feed its larvae on the pollen from this plant, it also collects fatty floral oils and mixes them with the pollen. This bee has very wide hind legs, presumably for transporting these floral oils. Chelostoma campanularum is another food specialist, this tiny wasp-like bee will only take pollen from a few plant species and again the scientific name is relevant as these plants belong to the genus Campanula (bellflowers). The males of this bee sleep in the flowers, so if you live in Europe and have any bellflowers in your garden keep an eye-out in summer especially early in the morning when the bees are still sleeping. There is one family of wild bees often categorised as solitary bees, which contains some species that are not solitary. I like to call this confusing group the “social solitaries”, though in some parts of the world they are known as “sweat bees” as some species have developed a habit of licking sweat from people’s skin. Some of these species appear to always be social, while others display both behaviours. Halictus rubicundus is a good example of this, as it is usually social in warmer areas and solitary in cooler ones. Some of the smallest bees in the world are in this group and they are also often among the most beautiful. Lasioglossum morio is a very small social species (5-6mm long) which has a metallic shiny green appearance. Unfortunately they are easy to overlook as they are so small and appear dark and colourless from afar. This is just a taster of the huge variety of shapes, colours, sizes and behaviours of bees. If you want to learn more then try your local bee or hymenoptera recording society, like BWARS (Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society), they have pictures and information on all 240+ bee species native to the UK. I have lots of favourite species, but there is one that I feel a particular affection for: Xylocopa violacea, the violet carpenter bee. This massive solitary bee has very beautiful iridescent purple wings; it’s currently native across continental Europe and Asia but a few individuals find their way to the UK most years. Unfortunately I’ve never seen it in the wild, so I’m hoping it will soon colonise the UK."

With all the hullabaloo about politically correct “Happy Holidays” greetings, as done up in electric lights on top of the Sierra Nevada Brewery, I thought the Christmas Star would be an appropriate topic.

About 2,006 years ago, according to a widely accepted historical and biblical accounts, a star rose in the east and guided three eminent thinkers, known as the Magi,  to the scene of an event that was to change the face of the world.
Since that time, astronomers and theologians have been baffled as to the precise nature of the star which, as told in the Gospel of St Matthew, led the Magi to the stable in Bethlehem where Christ was born.
Was it a miracle, a divine intervention to herald the birth of Christ? Was there a star at all, or was it simply added to the Bible to fulfil an Old Testament prophecy? Or was there some actual astronomical event that gave rise to the story of the Star of Bethlehem?
These questions have intrigued scores of scientists, writers, and artists ever since.
Evidence drawn from modern Biblical scholarship, recent findings in space and ancient Chinese history to suggest that evidence of the star’s existence could be at hand.
A British astronomer, Mark Kidger suggests that the Nativity may well have taken place at some time in March or April rather than in December.
Christ’s birth is said to have taken place while shepherds were watching their flocks at night, he notes, something that takes place at lambing-time in the spring rather than in the depths of winter. If the local inns were full, as the Gospel of Matthew insists, this would be because of the Jewish Passover, which also occurs in the spring.
Kidger concludes that Christ was born some time around March in 5 BC, taking account of the generally accepted fact that the inventor of the Christian calendar, the 6th century monk Dionysius Exiguus, was five years out in his calculations.
Ther have been several theories, including  the “star” could have been an unusual sighting of Venus, or perhaps Halley’s Comet, a supernova, or a meteor shower.
More plausible is the popular theory that what the Magi saw was a planetary conjunction, which occurs when two planets pass very close to each other in the sky, often producing a very striking configuration.
As shown in the picture above, generated by a computer program known as Starry Night, one such conjunction took place in 7 BC when Jupiter and Saturn came close to each other three times in seven months and were then joined by Mars, an event known to have been observed in Babylonia, well to the east of Bethlehem.
A more recent idea is that the Star of Bethlehem may have been an occultation of Jupiter by the moon that occurred in 6 BC, the re-emergence of the royal planet from behind the moon’s disc suggesting a royal birth.
However Kidger points out that the event would have taken place so low in the twilight sky of the region it would have been impossible to observe directly.
For his “best guess” at solving the Star of Bethlehem riddle Kidger looks to an ancient Chinese chronicle called the Ch’ien-han-shu which states that an object, probably a nova, or new star, was observed in March in 5 BC and remained visible for 70 days.
The object would have appeared in the east and remained in the sky long enough to have guided the Magi — Babylonian astrologers, according to some scholars — across the desert to Bethlehem.
“It’s hard to believe the Star of Bethlehem could have been anything else,” Kidger says of the nova, citing the coincidence in date, the duration of visibility and its position in the sky. And proof of its identity may soon be possible by looking for its telltale remains when the successor to the Hubble telescope goes online in 2011.
When a star goes nova, or supernova, if it has any planets, those planets usually become toast in the process. It may be that our birth of Christianity was heralded in by the destruction of another planet, possibly an entire civilization. As they say, God does work in mysterious ways.

"David Cameron might have been forced into accepting several restrictions on fracking to avoid a Commons defeat, but one thing that has never appeared in doubt is the Conservative party leadership’s commitment to the practice.   A year ago, the prime minister famously declared: “We’re going all out for shale. It will mean more jobs and opportunities for people, and economic security for our country.” Chancellor George Osborne also wrote a detailed letter to ministers asking them to make policy implementation a “personal priority”. The UK government has said that fracking has three main benefits: energy security, decarbonisation and economic growth. The government has shown clear support for test drilling to assess the economic feasibility of fracking. It has reinforced this support with a range of policies such as tax breaks; local compensation rules; pro-fracking planning guidance; and a sovereign wealth fund from shale petroleum revenues that would be invested in north England.  Yet the government has not gone all out for shale. It is part of a loose coalition of organisations which, “on average”, is tentatively pro-fracking. The coalition includes UK government departments and agencies, the three main UK political parties, would-be frackers such as Shell and Cuadrilla, industry groups such as Oil & Gas UK, and groups generating and sharing research such as the Royal Academy of Engineering and the British Geological Society.  The common element to this coalition is a wish to approve test drills, to get a better sense of the economic potential of shale gas, and support extensive regulation. Only some members of this coalition favour the “all out” strategy. The anti-fracking coalition that it competes against is smaller but has a less equivocal political position. It includes the likes of the Green Party, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, Frack off, Friends of the Earth and WWF UK. Neither has the UK government sought to take full control of shale petroleum policy. It has overall responsibility for energy and retains ownership of mineral and gas resources, but has not centralised many aspects of fracking policy.  These policy aspects are shared between devolved governments, who are responsible for developing national planning guidelines (Scotland will also soon receive powers on licensing); local authorities charged with granting planning permission for individual drilling sites; and public bodies responsible for ensuring environmental protection and health and safety. It also shares responsibility for environmental policy with the European Union.  The UK has taken responsibility for strategic issues related to energy security, finding evidence to address questions about the economic viability and environmental uncertainty around fracking, the tax and incentives regime, and the UK-wide system granting energy companies the right to operate to extract minerals. But crucially it has not sought to control the decision to approve drill sites in local areas (a Lancashire County Council decision looks likely to approve two controversial sites, but it is the council that retains the control and not the government).  This is reflected in its rather convoluted “regulatory roadmap” for private companies. It involves at least 15 steps and interaction with government and numerous public bodies, culminating in the need to satisfy local authorities that the energy companies should drill in their area. (By the way, public bodies, such as environment agencies, also implement a complex mix of EU, UK and devolved regulations.) The result is that we don’t quite know what will happen, particularly since devolved and local governments are much more hesitant to approve actual development in their areas. The UK government may be ostensibly “all out for shale”, but this is not reflected in its decision – not least the latest climbdown in the Commons, though that can at least be put down to realpolitik.  On this basis, we might expect one of three things (assuming of course that energy prices return to levels at which shale gas is economic). First, as events proceed and local areas begin to make decisions on individual sites, the anti-fracking coalition may swell to reflect a growth in opposition or the decision of local authorities to reject planning applications. This is particularly likely if tremors or earthquakes happen again close to test-drilling sites.  Second, the majority coalition may swell, but change further to reflect a greater degree of hesitant pro-fracking attitudes that are not sufficient to enable commercial fracking to go ahead. Or third, the majority coalition might become more in favour of fracking, perhaps following test drills and the gathering of evidence that suggests that regulations are sufficient and the commercial potential of shale gas is more certain. Obviously energy prices will have a vital bearing on how this proceeds. The latter outcome is by no means certain whatever David Cameron and his allies are saying in public."

UPDATE: The national website www.junkscience.com has referenced this blog entry.
From the waaaayyyy over the top department:
The Weather Channel’s climatologist, Dr. Heidi Cullen who hosts the program “The Climate Code”, is advocating that broadcast meteorologists be denied certification (or re-certification) if they express skepticism about predictions of manmade global warming. She posted this revelation in the blog she runs on the Weather Channel website and you can read it here: http://climate.weather.com/blog/9_11396.html
She writes: “If a meteorologist has an AMS Seal of Approval, which is used to confer legitimacy to TV meteorologists, then meteorologists have a responsibility to truly educate themselves on the science of global warming.” “Meteorologists are among the few people trained in the sciences who are permitted regular access to our living rooms. And in that sense, they owe it to their audience to distinguish between solid, peer-reviewed science and junk political controversy.” “If a meteorologist can’t speak to the fundamental science of climate change, then maybe the AMS shouldn’t give them a Seal of Approval.”
Them’s scientific fightin’ words lady.
So, apparently any free speech, scientific debate, and public dialog that doesn’t agree with the peer reviewed popular scientific opinion is grounds for denying an AMS Broadcast certification?
This reminds me of Galileo and his fight with the Roman Catholic Church in 1632. Galileo wanted to publish a book Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems which totally revised the earth centric view of the universe favored by scientists, scholars, and clergy of the time and built on the work of the earlier astronomer Copernicus. Galilieo was tried and imprisoned for daring to speak out against the “consensus” of the time for what he saw as a scientific truth.
I think we would all do well to follow this maxim: “People who live in greenhouses shouldn’t throw stones”.

Open scientific debate is essential to the scientific process, to call for castigating and silencing TV weathercasters who see other evidence is not only against American free speech values, it’s unprofressional for a scientist. Freedom of speech is the concept of the inherent human right to voice one’s opinion publicly without fear of censorship or punishment.
I support Cullen’s freedom of speech to make the claim that Global Warming is entirely an affliction caused by humanity, but I don’t support her call for decertifying of proponents of alternate theory
Despite receiving over 1000 blog comments by the public, most of them harshly critical of Cullen’s call for suppressing the voices of manmade global warming skeptics Cullen has refused to retract her call for AMS decertification of broadcasters who may also be global warming skeptics but instead blamed the whole mess on “spin.‿ Here is her latest post on the controversy. No mention of the word “sorry” or mea culpa in that post.
The Weather Channel has yet to officially comment on the matter. They are most likely being very careful as they are now in the middle of a scientific and political firestorm.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOf good trees and bad trees: an unimaginable story
By Die kalte Sonne
(Text translated by P Gosselin)
We have already reported about the very different views on trees in this blog. Perhaps this phenomenon has something to do with the fact that the words environmental protection and nature conservation are slowly but surely disappearing from our language and being displaced by climate protection. Everything has to subordinate itself to this, also environmental and nature protection. Sometimes this has has had disastrous consequences.
The value of trees is in the eye of the observer or his agenda
Trees are extremely valuable carbon stores. They are true CO2 sinks. It is estimated that a large tree removes and stores about 12.5 kg of CO2 per year from the atmosphere. Actually, one would have to think, we should not only reforest massively, as Professor Werner Sinn suggested in his lecture “How we save the climate and how not“, but also preserve existing tree populations.
Of course, trees are protected, sometimes with drastic means such as in the Hambach Forest. There, however, not for CO2 storage reasons but because the activists want to prevent lignite mining. Such actions are spectacular and get through the media. So this is about good trees.
Much less attention is paid to protests by residents of Grünheide in Brandenburg, who are mobilizing against the deforestation of an area the size of 420 football pitches, which are to make way for Tesla’s new megafactory. Here too, nature is losing carbon stores, and no activist is really itching because they are bad trees. Or were there demos of Fridays For Future (FFF) or Extinction Rebellion in Grünheide?
Weird swaps in Scotland
Just as little interest in Scotland. There it has now been discovered that almost 14 million trees have had to be felled since 2000 to build wind turbines (WTGs). According to the above calculation, Scotland has thus “given up” 175,000 tonnes of CO2 reduction per year in order to save the climate. Even planting 100,000 trees, as in Scotland, is of little use, as they only replace the lost capacity to a very limited extent. Trees simply need time until they are stately and can absorb the above-mentioned amount of CO2 annually.
Foundations and access
The areas for the foundations are still the least of the evils, although in Schleswig Holstein alone, a sealed area of 3 million square meters was assumed in 2018. Approximately 1300 cubic meters of concrete and 180 tons of steel disappear in such foundations.

It is not even clear how such colossuses are to be removed from the forest later on, or how they can be removed at all. Anyone who has ever spent a holiday in France on the Atlantic Ocean knows that concrete remains, i.e. bunkers, of the 3rd Reich bunkers stubbornly refuse to decay on the coasts. Ina 1000 years probably only the bunkers of the Nazis or the foundations of wind turbines will remain.
Access to wind turbines is much more serious than the foundations, which only cover a relatively small area. Wind turbines are getting ever taller and the rotors ever bigger. The radius that the special transport vehicles now is so large that a massive quantities of trees have to make way for access roads. And since the wind turbines only have a limited lifetime, the access roads have to remain, because at some point they will have to be dismantled or maintained. The forest at this point is lost and chopped up.
German conservative CDU now poised to play along
The CDU Lower Saxony is now poised to go along with a proposal that more wind turbines in forests should be approved. Whether an impact assessment has been made here? Especially in forests, the population of birds of prey is high and one can only guess what will happen if huge rotors rotate over birds or their breeding grounds and habitat. These rotors are, as studies show, a considerable hazard for birds of prey.
Indeed the wind power lobby is trying to invalidate such studies, for example by pointing out the large number of songbirds and garden birds that are killed annually by windows, cars or cats. But if you use your common sense, here you see whataboutism in its purest form. Birds of prey very rarely die from windows, cars or cats and songbirds and garden birds rarely die from wind turbines. At the latest, when the census of seabirds in the Irish Sea – an area with a lot of wind turbines – shows that the population is declining massively, the windscreen/cat/car argument falls apart.
The same outcome, but completely different reactions
But it gets really crazy when we look at the situation in places like the Reinhardts Forest in the state of Hesse. This forest is very valuable, because it still has a virgin forest character in parts. Nevertheless, wind turbines are to be built there with all the consequences described above. Residents’ protests are being dismissed as an obstacle to technology and energy production transformation.
Yet, at the same time, the people go into collective outrage when the Amazon becomes smaller through slash-and-burn clearing. In both cases forests, biotopes and very same carbon reservoirs are lost, but with completely contrary reactions. Good and bad trees.
Used to be tranquility above the tree tops
But forests are much more. Many people pursue various activities there. A climate activist from Berlin Kreuzberg or Hamburg Ottensen may find this hard to imagine, but there are actually people who visit the forests enjoy tranquility or the sounds of nature. If the plans of wind power advocates are anything to go by, then in many forests this will soon be lost forever.

Yes, Virginia, there is a sales tax. With Republicans no longer in control of the House, Forbes says this may be the last Christmas you’ll be able to dodge sales tax by buying that $350 iPod or $1,200 laptop online.
The Internet was just coming into its infancy in 1994 when Republicans took control of the House and Senate. Republicans have been steadfast in their resistance to taxing the Internet, but they may no longer be able to prevent it.
From the article:
“With Democrats in charge… ‘The stars are lined up better,’ says Harley Duncan, executive director of the Federation of Tax Administrators, which represents state tax officials… [But] this is hardly a done deal. The 4,700-member Direct Marketing Association is fighting any new authority for the states.”
It remains to be seen if the Internet will become the next tax revenue source. One thing’s for sure, Al Gore won’t come out and say he invented Internet taxation.

Global Warming is a hot topic here on Earth, but it may be the issue will be settled not here on Earth, but on Mars.  A study of the ice caps on Mars suggests it is also experiencing a warming trend. A story about new data from NASA cites a six year study by researchers at Duke University showing that Mars may also be seeing a Global Warming trend and that both the Earth and Mars are seeing changes related to solar output.


You can click on this link to get a time-lapse image of the Mars ice cap changes between 1999 and 2001. It may take awhile to load as its 1.6 megabytes in size. Those with very high speed connections can get an even larger and more detailed time lapse here which is 6.2 megabytes in size
Planetary scientists have been watching melting of deep, wide pits in the southern Martian ice caps. The melting is substantial. According to Michael Malin, principal investigator for the Mars Orbiter Camera, the polar ice cap is shrinking at “a prodigious rate.”
Now where have we heard that before? Oh, seems Al Gore said in his movie An Inconvenient Truth that our own ice caps are melting and that we’ll see a 20 foot rise in sea level as a result. Here’s a transcript of the movie if you are interested.
The scientists believe this observed melting on Mars means that there is a layer of dry ice that is evaporating off of a thicker layer of water ice. The yearly increases in evaporation may be caused by a global warming trend happening on Mars.
The most recent images in the NASA sponsored study show changes from 1999 to 2005, suggesting the climate on Mars is presently warmer, and perhaps getting warmer still, than it was several years or decades ago.
Another recent NASA announcement, that recent water flows have also been discovered on Mars, also lends credence to the idea that Mars is getting warmer. One of the mechanisms suggested is that liquid water is subsurface, and that patches of dry ice acting as “plugs” are melting, releasing the water which moves enough surface material around before it freezes again to show up on photographic comparisons.
If both Mars and Earth are experiencing global warming, then maybe there is a larger phenomenon going on in the Solar System that is causing their global climates to change, like changes in the Sun. There’s correlating evidence showing sunspot trends match temperature trends on Earth. Mars may have a similar linkage.
But perhaps there will be those arguing it’s because we’ve landed two tiny SUV’s (Space Utility Vehicles) named Spirit and Opportunity on Mars surface.

"The publication of a hefty two-volume report on geoengineering by the US National Research Council represents a marked shift in the global debate over how to respond to global warming. To date, the debate has been about mitigation, with the need for some adaption because of the failure to reduce emissions adequately. The new report, backed by the prestige of the National Academy of Sciences of which the NRC is the working arm, now argues that we should develop a “portfolio of activities” including mitigation, adaptation and climate engineering. In other words, rather than presenting climate engineering, and especially solar radiation management (rebranded “albedo modification”), as an extreme response to be avoided if at all possible, the report normalises climate engineering as one approach among others. To be sure, the committee writing the report points to the serious risks likely in albedo modification, but it recommends the US set in train what would be a major research program into various forms of geoengineering, including field experiments in a technique to cool the planet by spraying sulphate aerosols into the upper atmosphere. And it endorses the deployment of various carbon dioxide removal methods as relatively benign ways to counter human emissions, arguing that the decision on mitigation versus carbon dioxide removal is largely a question of cost. This approach is riddled with political dangers. By mainstreaming geoengineering as a response to global warming the committee has left behind the argument put by Dutch Nobel laureate Paul Crutzen, in his famous 2006 article that opened the floodgates for geoengineering research, that desperate times will require desperate measures. With no talk of “climate emergencies” in the report, we look in vain for any clear rationale for the possible deployment of albedo modification. The “buying time” argument – according to which we can temporarily increase the Earth’s albedo (surface reflectivity) while the world decides to put CO2 controls in place – has fallen out of favour because any warming suppressed by a solar shield will just come back to bite us once the shield is removed. So there is a contradiction buried in the report: it recommends the initiation of a federal research program into albedo modification but does not give a plausible analysis of the circumstances in which the solar shield might be deployed. The  recommendation that “Albedo modification at scales sufficient to alter climate should not be deployed at this time” (my emphasis) is hardly reassuring. In the absence of a rationale, the report reverts to the standard scientists’ trope: we need more information. Deploying a fleet of planes to coat the Earth with a layer of sulfate particles “should only be contemplated” when we have enough data to know what effect it would have, and for this we need a lot of research. But who should do it? Who should oversee it? Who should own the results? Who would deploy the technologies? How can we ensure research is not misused? These questions, which ought to come before a decision is made to proceed with research, are either not considered or are shunted off to some vague “governance” space. Research does not take place in a social vacuum. When scientists propose to investigate technologies that would allow someone to take control of the Earth’s climate, and the research is proposed only because powerful interests have prevented a much better solution, then the research is intensely and inevitably political. So we should not let the genie out of the bottle unless we are pretty sure we can put it back. And that means no research before governance. The committee stresses its desire for public engagement but then undoes it by seeming to endorse a proposal for an “allowed zone” in which scientists alone would decide which experiments could take place. In this zone, experiments “should not be subject to any formal … vetting and approval”, so the report’s fine words about civil society engagement begin to ring hollow. An essential mistake of the report is the unwillingness to recognise (even though it has been pointed out repeatedly) that field experiments that do not change the physical environment can radically change the social and political environment. To maintain the physical-social separation the report must play down or dismiss the problem of “moral hazard”, that is, the likelihood that a substantial research program, let alone any deployment, would almost certainly reduce the political incentives to rein in carbon emissions. The committee’s answer is, as always: we need more information to make good decisions. Of course, this does not answer the concern at all but merely asserts that more information will always trump the flaws of politicians – as if the information deficit model has proven itself so effective in the past. The committee has a touching faith in the power of reason and holds it up as a kind of crucifix, declaring that “it considers it to be irrational and irresponsible to implement sustained albedo modification without also pursuing emissions mitigation, carbon removal, or both.” And yet this report has been written precisely because we live in an irrational and irresponsible world. And one has to ask how rational and responsible it is to include solar radiation management in a “portfolio of responses” to global warming, as this report does. The mandatory declaration that albedo modification “does not constitute a licence for unbounded CO2 emissions” becomes a kind of incantation to ward off the irrationalities of the actual world. One strategy for creating a rational world where climate engineering would never be misused is canvassed in the report. Social anxieties over deployment of climate engineering could be mitigated by “further research”. Negative perceptions of programs to modify the Earth’s albedo should be “extensively studied” so that they can be countered.  Sadly, the social world does not behave like the Earth system. It cannot be reduced to theorems and principles to be uncovered by further research. If we knew how to fix society through scientific study we would not be in such a mess that we are now considering an idea that Ray Pierrehumbert, climate science professor and a rogue member of the committee, describes as “wildly, utterly, howlingly barking mad”."
"The opah, or moonfish, a large colourful fish living across the world’s oceans, has been found to have a warm heart and maintain a high body temperature, according to a report in the journal Science. It’s a zoological curiosity and a remarkable evolutionary development for fish. In the cold darkness of the deep sea there is a clear advantage to being warm-blooded and able to move faster than all the other creatures in order to hunt them down or to avoid being eaten. Mammals such as seals or whales exploit this to great effect. They take a big breath and dive down, insulated from the cold by a thick layer of blubber, to snatch live food such as squids, fish and shrimps from the depths. Until now it was thought that fish couldn’t keep warm in this way because instead of breathing air they extract oxygen directly from the water through their gills. The advantage of this is obvious: fish can stay underwater indefinitely. However, although their blood may be warmed by muscle activity on every circuit of the body as it comes gushing out of the heart it goes directly into the gills and is instantly cooled to ocean temperature.   The gills are intricate oxygen exchangers. A tiny membrane one thousandth of a millimetre thick is all that separates the blood and the sea, which ensures instant transfer of oxygen into the red blood cells. Heat flows faster than oxygen, so no matter how much heat the fish might be generating, its blood is automatically chilled with every heart beat. The opah (Lampris guttatus) has evolved a unique solution to this problem. A team from the NOAA SouthWest Fisheries Science Center in San Diego, led by Nicholas Wegner, analysed fish collected off the coast of central and southern California and discovered they had a special insulated network of blood vessels between the heart and the gills. These vessels act as a heat exchanger in which warm blood from the heart reheats oxygenated blood leaving the gills before it goes to the body. In this way heat is retained and not dissipated into the ocean.   This enables the opah to maintain a body temperature 5°C higher than the surrounding water and to dive 500 metres below the surface without cooling down. An insulating layer of fat in the skin keeps the heart, brain, muscles and vital organs warm. This discovery is surprising since the opah is large and conspicuous; indeed, it’s already a favourite in fish markets and restaurants. Wegner and his colleagues deserve great credit for recognising and describing in detail the specialised gill heat exchangers that have been hidden right under the noses of fishermen and chefs for centuries.   The opah is shaped like a flattened disc with bright red fins. It grows up to two metres long and can weigh up to 80 kilograms. It’s a solitary fish, never caught in large numbers and is found in all oceans except polar seas. It swims by continuously flapping its pectoral fins in a similar way to the wings of a bird – and it is the energy from these muscles that provides most of the heat.  It has long been known that certain high-performance fishes such as sharks, tuna and swordfish can warm some muscles, the brain or their eyes using a dense web of warm and cold heat exchanging blood vessels around the area in question. However their blood is still cooled to ocean temperature each time it passes the gills, as in all other fishes. With its heart and all its vital organs working at an elevated temperature, the opah is the first fish that can be regarded as truly warm-blooded.  It is intriguing to speculate whether this is a new evolutionary trend for fish that in future might emulate the warm-bloodedness of birds and mammals. For most fishes living in tropical seas this adaptation is not necessary; the warm water temperature is ideal for life. But for the opah, which wants to stay down deeper for longer in order to hunt squid in cold waters, the warm-blood adaptation helps it outcompete partially heated rivals like the Albacore tuna. The mechanism can only work for large-bodied fish with space for insulation, meaning heat loss to the surroundings can be controlled. Even with specialised heat-retaining gills like the opah has, a small fish the size of a mouse would quickly cool down, the heat absorbing capacity of water is too great for any small animal to retain body warmth.   Even the opah is not able to compete with warm-blooded diving foragers such as penguins and seals, or whales in the polar seas. The fish is a zoological oddity belonging to a group that appeared in the last 100m years at the same time as mammals and birds evolved. We cannot know if the fossil species were warm-blooded and if we search further we may find other species with similar adaptations."
"India’s heatwave again highlights just how seriously extreme weather conditions threaten our ability to put sufficient nutritious food on all our plates.   Headlines have focused on the human deaths – at least 2,500 at last count – but a heatwave can hit farming too. There are reports of scorched crops and livestock struggling to survive in temperatures of 40C or more. More than 17 million chickens have died so far, leading to rapid price increases.   What is not yet so clear is the effect of the current extreme conditions on crop yields and food supply later in the year. Crop scientists the world over are grappling with these questions – but can their work can really protect food security in the face of extreme climate challenges? Extreme weather like that India is experiencing at the moment presents crops not just with extreme high temperatures, but also with drought. Of those linked challenges, drought is the easier of the two to deal with, at least at first sight. Farmers have been watering crops for millennia, but the scale of modern food production means agriculture is already a major user of freshwater resources in many parts of the world, competing with the demands of other industries and, of course, the need for adequate safe drinking water. Irrigation water has to come from somewhere. That might be from lakes and rivers, perhaps diverted into reservoirs, or from groundwater. However all these sources are already under intense pressure, both in India and elsewhere – California is another very topical example.   Taking too much water from those sources has knock-on effects on rivers and wetlands.  Over-extraction of groundwater can also allow sea water to seep in to groundwater, reducing its quality for both people and crops. So, while irrigation has a part to play, we have to recognise that water is a limited resource  in much of the world, and that we need to use it as efficiently as we possibly can.  Poorly managed irrigation, especially using poor quality water, also contributes to the build-up of salts in agricultural soils. Ironically, trying to deal with the heat and drought can introduce a third threat to food production, saline soils.  So, beyond irrigation, what options are there? Producing crops that can grow and yield in the face of high temperature, drought and salty soils is a top priority for crop scientists around the world.   Some employ modern genetic modification techniques to produce new crop varieties that can cope with these harsh growing conditions. There are teams around the world manipulating specific crop traits to do this, but the problem lies in those three words: “specific crop traits”.  GM has given us the means to modify single genes. Whatever your views on GM crops, there is no doubt that changing a single gene can produce crops that are resistant to a herbicide or attack by a particular pest. But heat, drought and salinity damage crops through a range of mechanisms. You may be able to change a gene to reduce one type of damage but that’s just one piece in a complex puzzle.  You could look to combine different traits. Improving root growth for instance can allow a crop to access water deeper in the soil. Leaves might be modified to reduce water loss or to reflect more light to reduce the heat load.  Or plant chemistry might be changed, for example to help the plant deal with cellular damage caused by extreme heat, drought or salinity.   Combining these and other possible modifications might ultimately produce much more robust crops. For example the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is using these approaches to develop drought resistant rice, but that remains a huge technical challenge and is certainly no “quick fix”.   This “bottom up” combination of specific characteristics actually has many parallels with traditional breeding – crossing existing crop varieties to combine good characteristics and then screening thousands of offspring under challenging growing conditions to identify those that have improved performance. Again, that’s possible, and is being done now to produce new heat resistant maize varieties for Asian farmers, but it certainly isn’t a quick or easy process, even with modern methods that can accelerate traditional breeding. Crop scientists are also looking to alternatives to these genetic methods.  For example, we now understand how roots perceive drying soil, and then communicate that to the shoot to induce water-saving changes in the leaves.  That understanding has led to new water-efficient irrigation that delivers “more crop per drop”, an approach that can be deployed at very low cost even by small farmers.   Understanding how plants regulate their response to heat stress and salinity also provides routes by which we might intervene to boost these responses – a little like boosting our immune system to help prevent disease rather than cure it. There is a great deal of promising research here, and hints that a new generation of anti-stress agrochemicals may not be too far away, many based on plant’s own natural defence systems. Increasing crop losses are one symptom of the weather extremes which are becoming ever more commonplace.  Advances in crops and agricultural methods help reduce the severity of that symptom, but we have to be realistic about the limits.  Even the best application of crop science can’t make the world’s staple crops able to cope with every extreme of weather.  Simply dealing with the symptom is useful, but it can’t be a substitute for a cure to the underlying cause. While we can’t simply link the current heatwave in India with climate change, the message surely isn’t all that hard to read.  Let’s hope that’s a message which is heard in Paris this Autumn."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s been acknowledged by mainstream scientists for years now that at certain locations on planet Earth, rising carbon dioxide levels cause cooling. It’s now been determined that rising CO2 also causes “negligible” cooling (or warming) depending on the season.
A few years ago a seminal paper (Schmithüsen et al., 2015) was published in Geophysical Research Letters that indicated raising the concentration of CO2 causes a negative greenhouse effect, or cooling, in central Antarctica.
The forcing from the CO2 greenhouse effect ranges from -2.9 W/m² to +1 W/m², and the forcing for the Arctic (central Greenland) is said to be “comparably weak”.

Image Source: Schmithüsen et al., 2015
Now scientists have found that CO2 – to the extent that it has a “negligible” influence on temperature – causes the climate to cool from winter to summer and to warm from summer to winter.

Image Source: Lightfoot and Mamer, 2018
For the most part, CO2 varies due to temperature and water vapour level changes. The variance can range from 403 ppm during the drier winter to 377 ppm during the summer.

Similar seasonal CO2 variability can be found in pristine cave environments.
A paper published earlier this year (Al-Manmi et al., 2019) also finds CO2 rises to 756 ppm in winter but drops to 484 ppm in summer.
So observations indicate higher CO2 concentrations are linked to cooler temperatures, not warmer temperatures.

Image Source: Al-Manmi et al., 2019
Nowhere do these observations support the paradigm that says real-world temperature (and water vapour) changes are driven by variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
If anything, it’s the other way around.

You may have heard or seen that I donated the equipment and continue to provide the high bandwidth server to carry the City Council Meetings, School Board, Planning Commission and other public meetings via live Internet Webcast as a public service.
Councilman Larry Wahl and I worked together on this project to make it become a reality, and I was pleased to announce its operation in September of 2005. It was a fun and useful project since many people can’t get cable channel 11 to see public meetings.
Well tonight as I blog this over a glass of wine, there’s some new personal satisfaction in that I’ve sucessfully completed a major test that will make this medium even more valuable for the citizens of our fair city.

It all started last week when Kris Koenig of the Chico Observatory asked me if I could run a live webcast to cover this weeks Northern California History Museum Cosmic Hike lecture series done in conjunction with the Chico Community Observatory. This weeks topic was about the Sun and Global warming, so naturally I said “absolutely”.
Now if you have ever said yes to something before fully understanding what you just committed to you’ll realize this is why parents tell their kids “don’t volunteer” when they go into the Army.
I figured, “hey no sweat”. I’ve done it before and I can do it again. Well, in the world of Internet connectivity, thats a whole different animal. I should have known better because last week I was knee deep in another computer problem when somebody suggested the Occam’s Razor solution, (the simplest answer is the most likely solution) to which I replied: “Occam never owned a computer!”.
Enter the CARD Center on Vallombrosa. They have a broadband network, should be easy to connect up my streaming video software and away we go…instant live broadcast right? Wrong.  Like many organizations, they have a firewall. A big one, and…it requires login to even do web browsing. No connect and go here.
My previous setup for the City Council Chambers used a fixed public IP address…the simplest most direct way to connect. But its also dangerous, as its like setting up a lemonade stand on Highway 99 and 149 interchange. You are likely to get run over just sitting there unless you know what you are doing. In my case it was designing an “invisible” server to connect the Cable 11 video feed to the Internet. Firewalls are designed to protect the foolish from the “raw” Internet and its vagaries of hackers, viruses, spyware, and trojans… but they also make life miserable when you want to do something other than simple web browsing and email.

So anyway, to make a long story short after four days of email, support calls, testing, alternate testing, testing again, reporting results, trying new things, etc I still didn’t have a working solution for Thursday night’s CARD center event. But I was getting close. I’d solved one Microsoft induced problem, that of a network card driver that didn’t like certain types of network traffic, but my network engineer and I were still butting our heads up against the CARD firewall problem.
Today, with help from a programmer, we tried a new setup and voila’ …all was right with the world again. We got it working at the CARD Center.
Not only can I now stream video from wired connections like the CARD center, but now I can stream video from almost ANYPLACE that has wired or wireless “WiFi”connectivity.

The little picture above of color bars may not say much to you, but to me it speaks volumes, because it was captured at the Market Cafe restaurant that has a firewall, PLUS a Wireless Encrytion Protocol. They use a WEP key that they give customers to logon. AND its traveling all the way to Arlington Texas where I have a rented high bandwdith server and back to the laptop on the bar again. it’s the worst case scenario. I brought in my laptop and set it up on the bar with my portable NTSC Test signal generator and a USB video capture device. And by golly…it works! I’m blogging this entry from the bar too.
So what does this mean?
Well it means that I can now broadcast ANY live event in Chico or wherever, as long as there is some kind or wired or wireless Internet connection. For example, I could broadcast concerts in the new City Plaza, I could broadcast from Laxon auditorium, I could broadcast from Starbucks, Bidwell Perk, Moxies, local schools, courtrooms, backyard BBQ’s, concerts, …you name it.
But wait…there’s more. Not only that, but now I have the ability to simultaneously record the live webcast and make it available for playback later. Did you miss last night’s City Council meeting where somebody suggested pushing conservative counselors out of Enloe’s Flightcare helicopter because “they are going to lose the next election anyway”…no problem, log on and play it back. Just joking, that never happened though something like it once did at a planning commission meeting.
The Internet world just got a whole lot bigger, look for fun stuff to come.

"Carbon dioxide is the “face” of the greenhouse gases, but nitrous oxide (N2O) merits its own spotlight. The same “laughing gas” once used by dentists as an anaesthetic and used today by people looking for a quick, giggly high, turns out to be pretty bad for the environment. Nitrous oxide (a molecule made of two nitrogen atoms and an oxygen atom) is over 300 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2 and accounts for 6.3% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions. If nations are to meet their climate change targets, they need to pay attention to N2O. While the gas is best known for its recreational uses, most of it is actually generated through farming, where microbes in the soil combine oxygen (from the air) and nitrogen (added to farmland) to create new compounds. This results in the leaking of N2O gas from the soil. As more nitrogen is added to the soil more N2O is emitted, so the best way to manage emissions is to control the nitrogen added via synthetic fertilisers, manures and slurries. This century, the world faces a challenge to supply enough nitrogen to maximise crop yields while reducing the release of excess nitrogen into the surrounding environment as pollution. It’s an issue I looked at in a recent report for the Parliamentary Office of Science & Technology.  Nitrogen is an essential element for life, but it is mostly present as an unreactive gas, dinitrogen (N2), which only a few organisms can use directly. Agriculture was revolutionised in the early 20th century when the large-scale industrial synthesis of nitrogen fertiliser became possible. Food production increased and population growth followed; but huge amounts of nitrogen have subsequently been added to soils and the increase of N2O emissions is the inevitable result. There are some scientific developments which could help to reduce nitrogen emissions while maintaining crop yields and so global food production levels. A few are listed here.  Instead of applying fertilisers equally across a field, precision farming allows farmers to fine-tune the location and amount of fertiliser spread by machines.  This is based on soil and plant condition measurements and associated software-generated maps – optimising the yield and reducing fertiliser waste (pollution) and cost. In 2012, 20% of English farms used soil mapping to optimise fertiliser applications.  Plants could be bred to enable a reduction in nitrogen fertiliser. Most commercial plant breeding focuses on maximising crop yields under optimal plant growth conditions, which include a requirement for high levels of nitrogen (usually delivered via fertilisers). Some researchers have argued for programmes which focus on breeding plants that perform better under lower nitrogen conditions.  The final option is further away from realisation: the crops’ genetics can be altered to reduce the need for nitrogen fertilisers. Some plants such as legumes (e.g. clover and beans) work with bacteria to convert unreactive N2 from the air into a form that is available to the plant. Scientists at the John Innes Centre in Norwich have recently begun research that aims to transfer this capability into cereal crops. These research efforts are part of an international focus to sustainably intensify agricultural production: increasing yields without adversely affecting the environment or cultivating more land. Nitrous oxide is critical to the debate on climate change, which means that farming is too."
"Shell’s recent AGM was tumultuous. Shareholders voted overwhelmingly for the company to report on whether its activities were compatible with promised government action on climate change. The firm’s board reportedly faced a sometimes-hostile barrage of questions about its approach to the environment. The key question shareholders are asking is this: what if the majority of Shell’s proven fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground in order to avoid a dangerous global temperature increase of more than 2°C? Shell’s proved reserves are the company’s biggest asset against which it borrows money from banks and attracts investments from shareholders. Most of the oil and gas majors are struggling to find enough new reserves to keep growing in the future. This is why Shell and all other major players in the industry have to go to more extreme lengths to find the fossil fuels that keep our lights on, cars on the road and their profits growing. Controversial and environmentally very suspect investments into Arctic oil drilling, US shale gas and Canadian tar sands have already tarnished the environmental credentials of Shell. But Shell needs to find more oil and gas to keep its asset base growing and its profit potential intact. So it agreed to buy UK-based oil and gas exploration group BG Group for a staggering £47bn. To quote recent analysis, this  “gives Shell a presence in the productive zone off the coast of Brazil, and will ensure that Shell’s own production is maintained over the medium term, taking away the requirement to make large discoveries to offset natural depletion”.  But now an entirely new threat hangs over Shell’s future viability as a leading fossil fuel company. A high-profile campaign has argued that most of the proven reserves by oil and gas majors are “stranded assets” – something Shell has denied in the past. This would render Shell’s acquisition of BG Group and its investments in the Arctic wasted capital. The idea that fossil fuel firms’ reserves are overvalued because of looming climate legislation is often referred to as the “carbon bubble”. Shell’s chief executive, Ben van Beurden, was forced to admit at the recent AGM that this argument “sounds quite convincing and quite strong”. But he is also convinced that fossil fuels are here to stay for a long time to come and that decarbonisation will take decades. Can he really have it both ways? The campaign argues that we will never be able to burn any of the new fossil fuels we are discovering in the world from now on. At least not if we want to have a realistic chance of staying beneath a 2°C temperature rise above pre-industrial levels, which politicians agreed at the Copenhagen UN climate change summit in 2009 to be “the long-term goal”. It is that long-term goal that may stand in opposition to the long-term survival of Shell as a fossil fuel company. If the world will be prevented from burning oil and gas at increasing rates and emitting many more million tonnes of carbon gases than the biosphere can absorb, Shell’s current business model appears broken. Indeed, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund and other Shell shareholders have called on the company to reveal exactly how climate change could affect the company’s future, a motion that was carried at the recent AGM. In its latest New Lens Scenarios report, Shell admits that the world is on course for a temperature rise of well above 2°C. It says this will even be the case if coal is rapidly displaced by gas (which the company is banking on with its BG Group and shale gas investments) and there is an accelerated deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, which, however, has developed at a snail’s pace and requires large subsidies, making it non-competitive.  The wording of the report has led to claims by The Guardian – which has run its own high-profile “Keep it in the Ground” campaign – that Shell has given up on the 2°C target and is in fact planning for a much higher threshold of 4°C or even 6°C. I think this is overstated. But what is clear from the paper’s most recent interview with van Beurden is that Shell is banking on a very slow pace of climate change negotiations; it doesn’t feel under huge pressure to change its current business model until after 2015. Not a good omen for the forthcoming UN climate change summit in Paris.  At least since 2009, the world’s governments have failed to come up with credible plans for radically reducing carbon emissions. The worldwide scientific community agrees this needs to happen if we want to avoid dangerous effects of climate change. There has been far too much focus on listening to industry lobbyists protecting corporate interests, their current and future assets as well as millions of associate jobs in the oil and gas industry. Instead we need a clear-headed admittance that the business model of major fossil fuel companies needs to radically change if we don’t just want to adapt to climate change but have a last-ditch attempt of mitigating it. Shell’s CEO van Beurden seems to agree with this, but doesn’t see this radical change coming until post-2050. Most experts agree, however, that we cannot leave it until then; it’s too risky. Global, powerful corporations, such as Shell, are often targeted by environmental activists in their attempt to hold them to account. Rightly so. But they are simply money making machines. Investing into fossil fuels is still very profitable, and shareholders demand high returns on their investments. Only politicians can change the logic of energy investments, and they will have to do exactly that when they will sit around the negotiating table in Paris in December this year. If we want to have a chance to keep within a 2°C temperature rise, politicians have to realise that current investment practices in the oil and gas industry are not sustainable and even, in the words of Al Gore, “absurd”."

Have you ever worked for an employer that was cheap to the point of making you want to find another job? So miserly and humiliating at Christmas that you had visions of fun revenge instead of sugerplums dancing in your head?
Slate Magazine decided to have a contest for the worst corporate scrooge, and over 200 entries were submitted.

Some of the stories are pretty humorous, others are just downright depressing. You can read it here.
I have a couple of stories of my own. Both were TV stations I worked for. WLFI-TV in Lafayete Indiana where I got my start was owned by The Shively Brothers, and Harold, the younger brother, was the General Manager. They were newspapermen and this was their first TV venture. Being that, they were both clueless on how to run a TV station or treat employees that had been in the business awhile.
One Christmas ‘bonus’ was quit memorable. Each employee received a brass key chain with a giant brass letter signifying their last name. Seeing how mine was one of the largest letters, a “W”, and it was about 5 inches long making it impossible to even fit into my pocket. One employee suggested we all get together, spell out an appropriate message (you guess what it was) and present it to the our clueless GM.
Another one happened right here at KHSL-TV in Chico, soon after the corporate weasels from Catamount Broadcasting bought the station, and turned it from a pleasant family run business, to a place that was all about the bottom line.
Mickey McClung, the former owner, and a kind woman, always made sure each employee had extra money or a gift card to buy Christmas dinner for the family, and we could always count on that, and sometimes more in good years. The next owner, Howard Brown, kept the tradition and was even more generous.
After Catamount took over, we wondered what would become of that tradition. We soon found out.
The next Christmas we were presented with a $25 gift certificate to Holiday Markets. They were an advertiser, and the gift certificates were “trade outs” for airtime, so they cost the corporation nothing.
And…surprise, there are no Holiday Markets in Chico, the company had closed its Chico store that year. They had stores in Redding and Paradise, but with the price of gas, it was hardly worth the trip.
What I learned from these experiences was to treat my own employees well. And hand out real, significant cash bonuses at Christmas instead of something that will make them think less of you. Employees make the company, not the other way around.

Of course all we hear from the media nowadays is that weather extremes have been getting worse (over the past decades) and the planet is warming rapidly. But when we look at the untampered data, we see that many places have been cooling.
Today I present to you some examples, now that untampered November data for 2019 have become available at the JMA.
Iceland
First we look at November mean temperatures of three stations Iceland, isolated in the middle of the North Atlantic. The source of the data is the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA):

Three Icelandic stations with sufficiently available data from the JMA show a cooling November trend since the early part of the century. Data JMA.
In Iceland, the start of winter in fact has been getting colder, and not warmer like AGW theory would suggest. So there’s been lots of deception coming from activists.
Netherlands
The data tell a similar November story at the North Sea country of Netherlands: The start of winter is not getting delayed in the sense of warming. Quite to the contrary, it’s been cooling in November:

No real warming to be seen in November from the five examined stations in the Netherlands. Data: JMA.
Ireland
Over at the North Atlantic island of Ireland, we find 6 stations with sufficient data from the JMA to allow the plotting of November trends. Here’s the result of the six stations observed:

Warming? Ireland is hardly behaving like the alarmists and Greta claim. Early winter in Ireland has been cooling! Data: JMA. 
Norway (Greta’s neighbor)
Greta Thunberg’s western neighbor, Norway, has also been defying claims made the teenage Swedish activist, and, for the most part, has been seeing cooling in November for two decades:


<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->





November in Greta Thunberg’s neighbor, Norway, has been cooling for some two decades now. Data: JMA.
Seven of 11 stations in Norway show November temperatures have had a cooling trend since 1999 (20 years)!
This year TROMSO/LANGNES and VARDO saw their coldest November in the last 17 yrs, BODO VI, ORLAND III, BERGEN/FLORIDA and OSLO/GARDERMOEN were the coldest in 9 years.
Sweden
Next we move to Greta’s Sweden, whose future she says we are stealing. But looking at her home country as a whole, 3 of 6 stations in Sweden show November temperatures have had a cooling trend since 1999:

No significant Swedish warming during Greta’s lifetime. Data: JMA.
Powerful ocean cycles, not trace gas CO2
So how can these northern European countries examined above be cooling in times of “rapid global warming”? Why is winter coming earlier, and not later? Isn’t CO2 greenhouse gas supposed to be trapping heat there and making things warmer?
Obviously it isn’t, and so there has to be other natural explanations.
The explanation for this of course has long been suspected, but has been kept hidden from the public. The major reason for the cooling of November over the recent years very likely has something to do with the North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST).
As the following chart shows, SSTs are cyclic, and they have been trending down for the past 15 years.
 

Chart: NOAA, via Climate4you.
So it’s no surprise that November has been cooling over northern, coastal Europe since the start of the century. Claiming that CO2 drives climate is a sham.

"About one in nine people globally  still suffer from hunger, with the majority living in Africa and Asia. The world’s forests have great potential to improve their nutrition and ensure their livelihoods. In fact, forests could be essential to global food security, particularly when considering the importance of diverse, nutritionally-balanced diets. Forests are key to protecting biodiversity, and for mitigating the effects of climate change. This is well known. However their contribution to alleviating hunger and improving nutrition has been somewhat neglected. A recent study by the Global Forest Expert Panel on Forests and Food Security, which I chaired, shows how forests and trees can complement agricultural production and give an economic boost to some of the world’s most vulnerable regions.  Wild meat, fish, and insects are also important forest food sources. Insects are an especially cheap, abundant source of protein and fat. Caterpillars are great for vitamins and minerals. Particularly in South-East Asia, many forests and agroforests (tree-based farms) are managed by local communities specifically to enhance edible insect supply, such as the management of sago palms in Papua New Guinea and eastern Indonesia to support grub production.  Forests are also essential for firewood and charcoal. In developing countries, 2.4 billion people still use wood-fuel for cooking and heating. In India and Nepal, even better-off rural households depend on it. The volatile and often high prices for other energy sources suggest this situation is unlikely to change for some time. Access to cooking fuel provides people with more flexibility in what they can eat, including more nutritious foods that require more energy to cook. Trees offer a multitude of ecological services. For instance, they support bees and other pollinators, which are essential for crop production including on farmland. They also provide animal fodder that enables communities to produce meat and milk, and protect streams and watersheds as habitat for fish. Close to one out of six people directly depend on forests for their food and income, and it is important to recognise the rights of local people to these livelihood options. In the Sahel, for example, trees can contribute as much as 80% to household incomes, especially through shea nut production.  Novel initiatives are attempting to develop new tree commodities to supply the poor with sustainable incomes. For example, poor producers in Tanzania are engaged in a global effort to produce the seeds of the Allanblackia crop, which yield an edible oil. A private–public partnership known as Novella Africa is developing a sustainable Allanblackia oil business that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually for local farmers. Although forests are not a panacea for global hunger, they play a vital role in complementing crops produced on farms. This is especially important when the staple food supply is impaired by droughts, volatile prices, armed conflicts, or other crises.  While large-scale crop production remains important, it is highly vulnerable to extreme weather events, which may occur more frequently under climate change. Tree-based farming can adapt far better to such calamities. During periods of food shortage triggered by such events, forest foods can provide a vital safety net, especially for the poorest households. This forest-farm link also means that the loss and degradation of forests exacerbate the problem of food insecurity. Losing forests jeopardises “ecological services” such as a clean water supply, crucial for crop and livestock production. Managing landscapes on a multi-functional basis that combines food production, the maintenance of ecosystem services and other land use services should be at the forefront of efforts to achieve global food security. In the lead up to the UN’s finalisation of the Sustainable Development Goals later this year, the contribution of forests and tree-based systems to the “Zero Hunger Challenge” needs to be emphasised. They can be managed to provide better and more nutritionally-balanced diets, greater control over food inputs – particularly during lean seasons and periods of vulnerability (especially for marginalised groups) – and deliver ecosystem services for crop production. It will be a critical element of the responses to global hunger."
"As we enter 2020 and survey the state of the world, two competing storylines seem to dominate the present. The first is ruthless, relentless inequality. We see this not only in the imbalance of our economy, but also in our politics and government, in education and expression, and in the ways that our social structures and cultural practices dismiss and disregard people because of their gender, race, ethnicity, ability, and more.  Then there is the corollary: People standing up, speaking out, and fighting back. Young, inspirational figures like Kynan Tegar, Greta Thunberg, and Artemisa Xakriabá are spearheading movements to address the global climate crisis, because their future is at risk. And in places like Hong Kong, India, Lebanon, Mexico, Sudan and many others around the globe, ordinary citizens are demanding better treatment, more transparency, greater equality, and human dignity. They demonstrate, time and again, their willingness to sacrifice everything – their time, their efforts, even their safety – in service of a better future for us all. Unfortunately, the truth is, the courageous individuals leading the change – the people driving the conversation and making the largest sacrifices – too often are the very people most threatened by inequality. And so, I find myself asking: Why is it that those with the least tend to sacrifice the most? How can it be that the most comfortable among us contribute, in relative terms, the least? What crisis needs to befall us in order to act? To be sure, many with power and privilege already give with extraordinary generosity. As the president of the Ford Foundation, an organization originally endowed by a family of great means, I have seen firsthand how the generosity of a few can affect the lives of many. But this kind of generosity is too often superseded by the pervasive inequality of sacrifice – which we see both day to day and in the data. For example, a survey from The Chronicle of Philanthropy found that, during the Great Recession, American households that earned more than $200,000 reduced their giving by more than 4%, while households that earned less than $100,000 did just the opposite. In fact, as they saw the need increase, they increased their giving, in turn – by more than 4%. And this despite the fact that tax codes in the US, Europe, and other parts of the world have built-in incentives that reward the wealthy for their charitable donations. This all-too-common discomfort with sacrifice is not about good versus bad. The disconnect – and disconnection – follows from isolation and insulation. Separation breeds selfishness, despite the best of intentions. In the United States, for instance, segregation was outlawed over 65 years ago. Yet, a recent Civil Rights Project report found that America’s schools remain both separate and unequal. We see similar trends of geographical divide in cities across America and Europe, where a lack of economic opportunity has led to the disintegration of our social fabric. Restoring unity and trust will take more than generosity and good will. Charity, while wonderful, ameliorates the symptoms of inequality, but it does not address its root causes. And we must address the root causes. Keep in mind that large swaths of people around the world are growing increasingly impatient with the status quo, and we with power will feel their ire if we ignore their righteous demands for a fair and just society. So those of us with privilege need to find ways to do more justice. That means not only helping those who are often excluded, but also undoing the systems and structures that create inequities and imbalances in the first place. That will sometimes also mean working to transfer our own power, and giving up some of the privileges we currently enjoy. Toward the end of last year, when our foundation hosted a conference on the future of philanthropy, I was struck by something Luis Miranda Jr, philanthropist and father of the entertainer Lin-Manuel Miranda, said about the philosophy with which he was raised. “If it doesn’t hurt,” Miranda argued, “if you’re not not-doing something else, then you’re not giving enough.” This conception of sacrifice is profound: only when it is uncomfortable or even painful to give do you know that you are giving for reasons beyond your own benefit. And it is worth remembering that, despite this prick of pain, sacrifice has a value beyond what is given up. When you make this kind of sacrifice, you do not give up something for nothing; you give up some of your privilege for something far more valuable: justice. If we want to address the inequality of sacrifice, therefore, those of us with the most ought to recommit ourselves to doing the most. Perhaps that means paying a higher tax rate to finance public goods or wielding our influence to promote inclusive public policies. Or perhaps it means devoting more time, money, and effort toward rebuilding the broken systems that perpetuate inequality. We all must ask ourselves what system, status, or status quo we are willing to part with to benefit others. Only then – only when we have paired our generous impulses with acts of justice – will we diminish the inequality of sacrifice, and build a better, more equitable world. Darren Walker is president of the Ford Foundation"

There’s an article in The Oil Drum that focuses on electricity production; or rather how or what we will need to do to keep pace with people’s demands while balancing that with environmental and economic impact. It is lengthy but well-reasoned and good reading.
From the article: “One of the biggest threats the USA faces today is a serious shortage of energy. Vulnerabilities in our system have been made glaringly obvious several times; since the 1970’s the USA has had social and economic upheaval due to the actions of foreign oil producers, and two hurricanes in 2005 showed just how fragile our remaining domestic supplies of oil and natural gas are.”
The president recently reiterated a commitment to reducing our national oil consumption, and I hope that gets implemented as its really a good idea. Hybrids and electric vehicles are looking better and better. Chances are my next car will be one of these.

If you live near the ocean, chances are high that your home is built over sandy soil. For example many places in San Francisco are built on sandy soil or fill. Many homes built on this type of soil were badly damaged during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
When an earthquake strikes, deep and sandy soils can turn to liquid by a process known as liquefaction, with disastrous consequences for the buildings above. In an odd application of biotech, researchers at UC Davis have found a way to use bacteria to steady buildings against earthquakes by turning these sandy soils into rocks.
“Starting from a sand pile, you turn it back into sandstone,” the chief researcher explained. It is already possible to inject chemicals into the ground to reinforce it, but this technique can have toxic effects on soil and water. In contrast, the use of common bacteria to “cement” sands has no harmful effects on the environment. The new process, so far tested only at a laboratory scale, takes advantage of a natural soil bacterium, Bacillus pasteurii. The microbe causes calcite (calcium carbonate) to be deposited around sand grains, cementing them together.
So far this method is limited to labs and the researchers are working on scaling their technique.
Below: Before and After electron micrographs of microbiollogically-induced calcite  precipitation in which B. pasteurii cells are embedded.

Image Source: Syring et al., 2020
In a new paper (Syring et al., 2020), scientists rely on biomarker evidence – (a) the presence of warmth-demanding species Armeria scabra and Mytilus edulis, and (b) IP25, a proxy for the presence or absence of sea ice – to suggest not only were there much warmer (4 to 5°C) northern Greenland temperatures 10,000 to 8500 years ago, but effectively sea ice-free conditions pervaded the region during this time.
The sea ice in the region has been growing “continuously” for the last 4800 years, reaching its peak during the last millennium.
The authors also find decadal- and centennial-scale periodicities in solar activity have coincided with variability in Arctic sea ice (IP25) throughout the Holocene.

"Lots of people find elections dull, but there’s nothing boring about the political manoeuvres that take place in the animal kingdom. In the natural world, jockeying for advantage, whether this is conscious or merely mechanical, can be a matter of life or death. Chimpanzees, our closest relatives, are highly political. They’re smart enough to realise that in the natural world brute strength will only get you so far – getting to the top of a social group and remaining there requires political guile.   It’s all about making friends and influencing others.  Chimps make friends by grooming each other and forming alliances; this behaviour is especially prominent in males wishing to be group leader. In times of dispute they call upon their friends for assistance or when they sense a coup may be successful. And the ruling group either reaffirms its position or a new group grabs control – but having the weight of numbers is normally critical to success. Back in the 1980s, the leading Dutch primatologist Frans de Waal spent six years researching the world’s largest captive colony for his classic book Chimpanzee Politics. He soon realised that, in addition to forming cliques, chimp politics still involves some degree of aggression. Humans in modern societies have largely replaced antagonistic takeovers with voting.  Chimps do not, however, live in a democratic society. For them, the social structure of the ruling party is usually one based on male hierarchy, where dominant individuals have best access to the resources available – usually food and females.  In many primate species, the ruling party members are relatives.  Alternatively, power alliances between individuals are based on reciprocal altruism – more colloquially known as “you scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.”  Does some of this sound familiar? However social species don’t always need a ruling party or a charismatic leader and, even among the social primates, we have examples of leaderless organisation.   Muriquis, (or woolly spider monkeys) from south-eastern Brazil live in large social groups and yet there are no leaders.  Males do not boss other males or females and there is no dominance hierarchy – a truly egalitarian society. They are very peaceful primates. Males will even wait in line for their opportunity to mate with a receptive female.   Relative to many primate species, muriquis don’t spend much time grooming each other or socialising, which may suggest a poorly developed political system. But this would be an over-simplification, as individuals socialise through group hugs – and social network analyses confirm the important roles of certain individuals. For example, the longer a male hangs out with his mother, the more “introductions” to unrelated females he will get and more offspring he may sire. While we might expect our fellow primates to display some degree of recognisable “politics”, it is more surprising to discover that this behaviour extends right through the animal kingdom – and beyond. Bacteria are simple microscopic organisms and yet even at this lowly form of existence, individuals try and influence others into following their action. They of course do not have a leader but instead live in a decentralised system where decisions are made through a system of stimulae and response related to population density, known as quorum sensing.  Bacteria vote by releasing signalling chemicals and they are able to count the number of chemicals released (votes made). For example, pathogenic bacteria must vote on when to become virulent (exploit their host); that is, to jointly release virulence factors (chemicals). By acting together they overwhelm the host’s immune system and can therefore colonise it.  More famous decentralised “political” systems exist in social insects such as bees and ants. Bees sometimes need to find a new nest site and they too use quorum sensing to decide on the location. Individuals will go and search for potential sites and upon returning to the nest they will do their famous waggle dance indicating the location of the site they have found.   However if the site the bee has found is of poor quality it will quickly stop dancing. Those individuals who are the most persistent – who shout loudest and longest from their soap boxes – will gain the greatest number of followers to their proposed new nest site. These followers, having returned from the potential new nest site, become political activists and add their dance/vote to the cause until there is a landslide victory for one particular new nest site. What these examples show us is that politics is everywhere: from the bacteria in our bodies to the animals in the world around us. Like it or not there is no escaping politics: roll on May 8."

ER Sustainability Outlook 02/27/07
Sustainability is a trend that is growing not only here, but also throughout the world.
It is an attempt to provide the best outcomes for the human and natural environments both now and into the future.  Essentially you could think of it as balanced use of the planet, where the use doesn’t outstrip regeneration.
Locally there have been a number of movements towards this goal, particularly with solar power. Butte County is particularly well suited for solar power. Climate records show that we have 219 sunny days and 57 partly cloudy days per year on average, which makes solar power viable. It wasn’t always that way, and it’s only now that solar power is becoming economically viable due to increased electricity costs, increased solar cell efficiency, and state rebate programs to help home and business owners kick-start the process.

There’s three reasons to do solar power on your home or business:
1 – You want the economic benefit of reduced power costs.
2 – You want to do something environmentally sound.
3 – You have no other power options available, such as a summer cabin.
Most often it’s the first two, but there are some limits you should be aware of related to economics. Solar power can be an expensive proposition to install, even with rebates. Thus unless you have money to burn you have to plan it carefully to ensure that you get payback on your investment. You also need an unobstructed view of the southern sky.
I myself have placed two solar power systems into use, one on my home, and another for Chico Unified School District on Little Chico Creek School, which is the largest solar power system for a school north of Sacramento.
In both cases, there were high power uses going on, which made the economics easy. My home had a deep well, a pool, and an upper and lower A/C unit, making my power bills hit as much as $500 per month in the summer! I’m studying a design for a third solar power system on my new home, purchased just last year, but its more energy efficient, making the planning task more detailed.
Typically, you’ll need to have a power bill of at least $150-200 per month or more to make solar viable for your home as a retrofit. However, if you are building a new home, planning solar into the building process is less expensive.
Some forward thinking developers are now offering turnkey solar built into new homes, such as is being done in Fresno. So far, I haven’t seen Chico developers offer such an option, but I think the time is right for our Building Industry Association, Chamber of Commerce, and City Government to work together to make such an offering practical.
The way solar power works for homes and businesses is by a reverse metering scheme based on Time Of Use (TOU). During peak power need times of noon to 6PM on weekdays, electricity is far more valuable than during off-peak times. PG&E will credit any power generated during those peak times as much as 4 times the value of electricity used during off-peak times.
It’s sort of like the stock market, sell high and buy low.
To achieve this, your home or business has to outfitted with a TOU Meter, so that PG&E can track when you use power. Then when you connect a solar power system to that, it will log when you are generating power during midday peak times, and when you are drawing power during off-peak times. The trick is to generate exactly enough power to result in a net-zero energy use, because PG&E does not pay you back for any excess power generated.
A solar power system generates DC voltage from the solar panels, and when they are working at peak you can expect a 15% solar to electricity power conversion efficiency. The DC power from the solar cells must then be converted and phased to match the 60 cycle AC power grid. This is done with DC to AC inverters, usually mounted near your mains breaker box. There’s about a 10% conversion loss in that process.
If you are planning to do solar, there are a few things you should know:
· Pick a reliable contractor experienced with the process, particularly with the California Energy Commission rebate process, because a mistake there can cost you a lot of time and money.
· Be prepared to spend money or to seek financing. There are low cost state-sponsored finance programs available.
· Be patient. The process takes time, often more than you think, especially in a retrofit. There are applications, permits, tests, and government interactions involved.
· Solar will immediately add to the resale value of your home, that value never decreases. So when you get a state rebate, say for $10,000 towards the purchase, you get to keep that as equity.
· Financing should be balanced in such a way so that it is equal to or less than your average existing electricity bill, so that you are paying yourself back. When the system is paid off, then you’ll have zero payments for energy.
· You’ll be switched to a yearly billing system rather than a monthly. If your solar system doesn’t produce enough electricity to cover all your use, at the end of the year you’ll have what’s called a “true-up” bill, which could be large, but averaged over the year will be much smaller. Be sure to plan for that.
· Right now, solar isn’t for everyone as its still a rather expensive and complicated process to install as a retrofit. However, as solar panel efficiencies increase, and more companies get online producing solar cells, the costs will come down, as happens with any new technology.
· There are state and federal tax credits for any solar installation which when figured in with rebates, can make the project quite attractive, and in some cases, a very low cost.
Given that energy demands are only going to go up, and prices will naturally follow that demand, if you have high electric bills or have a business that could benefit, solar power is certainly worth looking into.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe current furor about an alleged connection between climate change, CO2 emissions, and Australian fires finds no support in the scientific literature. According to scientists, rising CO2 concentrations reduce fire ignition and burned area. Further, both global-scale and Australian fires were far more pervasive during the colder Little Ice Age.
Here’s what the scientific literature has to say about fires and their connection to climate and CO2 concentrations.

1. “Elevated CO2 and warmer climate promote global total tree cover” and higher CO2 “leads to reduced fire ignition and burned area” (Chen et al., 2019).
Image Source: Chen et al., 2019

2. Globally, fires were much more common during the colder Little Ice Age (Yang et al., 2007; Ward et al., 2018; Doerr and Santin, 2016), or before 1900. Fire frequencies have been rapidly declining as CO2 emissions began abruptly rising in the 1940s.

3. There has been a continued decline in global fire since the 21st century began (Earl and Simmonds, 2018).

4. Australia’s mainland experienced far more pervasive fire during the 1800s to early 1900s, or the Little Ice Age. There has been an abrupt decline in fire activity for the entire Australasian region in the last 50 years (Mooney et al., 2011).
Image Source: Mooney et al., 2011

5. The “assumed positive relationship between drier climates and biomass burning” is not supported by wetter Little Ice Age climates coeval with more burned area in Australia (Tibby et al., 2018).

Image Source: Tibby et al., 2018

6. Australia, like the globe, has neither become wetter or drier over the last 3 decades. There is “no evidence” global precipitation patterns have been been altered by global or regional temperature changes (Nguyen et al., 2018).

Image Source: Nguyen et al., 2018

To summarize, the scientific literature does not lend support to claims fires in Australia are connected to warming, rising CO2 emissions, dry climates, or wet climates.
If there were a potential climate linkage, it would be that enhanced fire activity arises in cooler climates.
In other words, there is no apparent link to anthropogenic global warming that can be supported by evidence found in the scientific literature.

Mila Zinkova of San Francisco who took this picture of the setting sun on Dec. 29, 2006
You have probably heard something about green flashes, but may not have seen one. If so, you’ll be happy to find that a number of pictures of green flashes are available on the Web like the one above. The one pictured above is special because its a TRIPLE green flash which is exceedingly rare.  Its explanation lies in refraction of light (as in a prism) in the atmosphere and is enhanced by layered atmospheric inversions and possibly fog.
There was a time when green flashes were thought to be fables. Jules Verne, of all people, fixed them as real in his 1882 novel “Le Rayon Vert” (The Green Ray). He described “a green which no artist could ever obtain on his palette, a green of which neither the varied tints of vegetation nor the shades of the most limpid sea could ever produce the like! If there is a green in Paradise, it cannot be but of this shade, which most surely is the true green of Hope.”
Green flashes are real (not illusory) phenomena seen at sunrise and sunset, when some part of the Sun suddenly changes color (at sunset, from red or orange to green or blue). The word “flash” refers to the sudden appearance and brief duration of this green color, which usually lasts only a second or two.
For an explanation along with some great pictures of the atmospheric optics involved in green flashes and other sorts of colorful atmospheric phenonmena, I recommend this website in the UK: http://www.atoptics.co.uk/

Who can forget the cartoon scene shown above where Wile E. Coyote has a little trouble controlling some tornados he seeds in yet another futile attempt to capture the elusive Road Runner?
About ten years ago I thought of creating a computer game where you could create and steer your own tornado, but then I quickly thought to myself “I’d instantly be laughed and ridiculed out of the TV weather business for making such a socially distasteful product” so the thought passed just as quickly as an F0 twister.
Today I’m wandering COMPUSA in LA and what do I see? A game called Tornado Jockey.
From the game’s website description: “Target different objects like: vehicles, baseball stadiums and drug stores. Steer your storm away from forces like ‘Ray Gun Trucks’ and ‘Radar Bombers’ that aim to kill your tornado. You’re at the helm of mother nature’s energy, so pick your path and have a little fun!”
Then they go on to add: * Percentage of proceeds are donated to the American Red Cross
Yeah…. surely that makes it far more… umm…socially correct?
Here’s a screenshot of what the game looks like in operation:


Some of the game features:
– In-game objects: dairy farms, gas stations, amusement parks, & more (what, no mobile homes?)
– Enemies like: ‘F-Killer rockets’, ‘Storm Chasers’, & ‘Ray Cannons’
– Educational facts for: funnels, tornado types, supercells, etc.
– Dynamic game-play, original settings, outstanding special effects!
There’s nothing like seeing “educational facts” while ripping apart an amusment park full of kids.
But the icing on the cake has to be the game summary, where a blonde “weather babe” does a live TV report and tallies up your damage score in dollars.

Please excuse me while I go practice some power hurling into a wastebasket.   Blllluurrrrch!

"Australia’s bushfire crisis is expected to contribute up to 2% of what scientists forecast will be one of the largest annual increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide on record. The atmospheric concentration of the heat-trapping gas is projected to peak at more than 417 parts per million in May, and average about 414.2 parts per million for the year, according to the forecast by the British Met Office. It is a 2.74ppm increase above the 2019 average.  Science agencies have associated concentrations of more than 450ppm with average temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels, a point at which some catastrophic effects of global heating may become irreversible. In its statement explaining the forecast, the Met Office Hadley Centre highlighted the role of the Australian bushfires in contributing to the unusually large forecast annual rise. Richard Betts, a professor with the Met Office and the University of Exeter, said human-induced climate change and local weather patterns had contributed to the hot, dry weather that played a key role in the severity of the Australian bushfires, which in turn increased emissions. Fires have affected more than 12m hectares of country this season, including more than 5m hectares in New South Wales. Betts said fossil fuel burning and deforestation had driven a year-on-year increase in carbon dioxide levels since 1958, when readings began at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, but the rate of the increase fluctuated depending on how much was absorbed by forests and other ecosystems. The response of ecosystem carbon sinks was expected to be weaker than normal for a second year running as warmer and drier conditions limited the ability of plants to grow and absorb carbon dioxide, increasing the risk of wildfires that released more emissions. “While human-caused emissions cause the carbon dioxide rise in concentration, impacts of weather patterns on global ecosystems are predicted to increase the rise by 10% this year,” the statement says. It says emissions from the Australian fires contribute “up to one-fifth of this increase”, or up to 2% of the total rise. Emissions from bushfires are usually considered to be climate neutral in carbon accounting, based on the assumption that forest regrowth absorbs a similar amount of carbon dioxide as was released. But scientists increasingly warn this is likely to be optimistic as many burned areas never recovered to their pre-fire state. Australia contributes about 1.3% of annual global emissions under UN greenhouse accounting rules. Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, said the wildfire emissions would not be counted in Australia’s emissions due to the way the country constructed its greenhouse gas reporting. “Along with other accounting tricks, such as Kyoto carry over, it is a clear global signal of the effect of Australia avoiding its responsibility to take real action,” he said. Ken Thompson, a former NSW deputy commissioner for fire and rescue, said it should not be a surprise that Australia’s fires were making a mounting contribution to the climate crisis. “Our emissions from bushfires keep going up as a result of our failure to address climate change, creating the conditions for even worse fire seasons to come,” he said. Met Office research suggests a 2C rise in global temperatures is likely to lead to between 20 and 30 extra days of “very high” fire risk in south-western and eastern Australia each year. It found the area at risk of “extreme” fire danger conditions could increase by about 20m hectares, roughly the size of Victoria."
"The Atlantic Ocean’s surface temperature swings between warm and cold phases every few decades. Like its higher-frequency Pacific relative El Nino, this so-called “Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation” can alter weather patterns throughout the world. The warmer spell we’ve seen since the late 1990s has generally meant warmer conditions in Ireland and Britain, more North Atlantic hurricanes, and worse droughts in the US Midwest. However a colder phase in the Atlantic could bring drought and consequent famine to the developing countries of Africa’s Sahel region. In the UK it would offer a brief respite from the rise of global temperatures, while less rainfall would mean more frequent summer barbeques. A cold Atlantic also means fewer hurricanes hitting the southern US.  The good news is our latest research, published in the journal Nature, gives us a much better understanding of these Atlantic oscillations. We now know that accelerations in sea-level rise in cities like New York and Boston on the north-east coast of the US are linked to a cold spell in the Atlantic.  The bad news, at least if you’re an African farmer or have a coastal property in New England? We’re about to go into a cold phase. Once we adjust for overall global warming trends, an oscillation in Atlantic sea-surface temperatures emerges. The ocean went through a warm period in the 1930s/1940s and again in the 1990s/2000s. However the 1970s/1980s were much cooler and there are hints of a transition to a relatively cold period at the moment. This is known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the transition between its positive and negative phases can be very rapid. For example, Atlantic temperatures declined by 0.1ºC per decade from the 1940s to the 1970s. By comparison, global surface warming is estimated at 0.5ºC per century – a rate twice as slow. In many parts of the world, the AMO has been linked with decade-long temperature and rainfall trends. Certainly – and perhaps obviously – the mean temperature of islands downwind of the Atlantic such as Britain and Ireland show almost exactly the same temperature fluctuations as the AMO. Atlantic oscillations are associated with the frequency of hurricanes and droughts. When the AMO is in the warm phase, there are more hurricanes in the Atlantic and droughts in the US Midwest tend to be more frequent and prolonged. In the Pacific Northwest, a positive AMO leads to more rainfall. A negative AMO (cooler ocean) is associated with reduced rainfall in the vulnerable Sahel region of Africa. The prolonged negative AMO was associated with the infamous Ethiopian famine in the mid-1980s. In the UK it tends to mean reduced summer rainfall – the mythical “barbeque summer”. Because the AMO influences a range of climate conditions in different parts of the world, it is important that the mechanisms driving it are properly understood. Scientists have widely hypothesised that ocean circulation, and in particular the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation which sends warm surface water northward (the Gulf Stream) and deeper cold water southward, drives the phases of the AMO by moving heat around. However, we do not have direct observations of ocean circulation of sufficient duration to support this theory, which has lead some to question whether the AMO is actually controlled by the ocean. We have measurements of the strength of the Gulf Stream flow in the Straits of Florida since 1982 and the flow across the Greenland-Scotland ridge since the mid-1990s. Since 2004, we also have continuous, full-depth, basin-wide measurements of the Atlantic overturning circulation with the RAPID monitoring project at 26ºN. However, none of these records are long enough to directly link ocean circulation with the decadal climate variations such as the AMO. Sea-level measurements from tide gauges on the other hand extend back more than 100 years in places. Many studies, dating back to 1938, have used this data to study variations in ocean circulation. In our latest research we were able to show that differences in sea level along the US east coast provide a measure of the strength of ocean circulation. Sea-level fluctuations from Florida to Boston can be divided by Cape Hatteras, where the Gulf Stream leaves the coast to flow eastward. The difference (south minus north) is representative of ocean circulation, and more circulation means more heat is transported. By comparing our sea-level index against the AMO index we were able to provide, for the first time, observational evidence of the widely hypothesised link between ocean circulation and the AMO. Our results show that ocean circulation responds to the first mode of Atlantic atmospheric forcing, the North Atlantic Oscillation, through circulation changes between the subtropical and subpolar gyres – the intergyre region. This a major influence on the wind patterns and the heat transferred between the atmosphere and ocean. The observations that we do have of the Atlantic overturning circulation over the past ten years show that it is declining. As a result, we expect the AMO is moving to a negative (colder surfer waters) phase. This is consistent with observations of temperature in the North Atlantic."
"The Prince of Wales has urged business and political leaders at Davos to embrace a radical reshaping of economies and markets in order to tackle the climate crisis. In a special address at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Charles outlined a 10-point plan to help the global economy become more sustainable including the imposition of green taxes and investing in environmentally friendly technologies. He argued that taxes, regulations and policies could all be changed, as part of a drive to reverse environmentally damaging subsidies such as financial assistance for the fossil fuel industry. He also cited the “polluter pays” principle that requires those who create environmental damage to pay for the clean-up. “In order to secure our future and prosper, we need to evolve our economic model,” the Prince told an audience of politicians and business and civic leaders at Davos. “Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink in time to restore the balance, when we could have done?” Charles, who is supported financially by the £1bn Duchy of Cornwall, made a direct challenge to some of the world’s wealthiest people gathered at the Swiss ski resort to think about more than money. “What good is all the extra wealth in the world gained from business as usual if you can do nothing with it except watch it burn in catastrophic conditions?” he said. Charles, who also met the climate activist Greta Thunberg at the summit, urged the private sector to use its ingenuity and practical skills to help lead the world out of a climate calamity. “The only limit is our willingness to act and the time to act is now.” Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and the elaborate system of badges reveals your place in the Davos hierarchy. The meeting is sponsored by a huge number of international banks and corporations. For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all a big waste of time.  The 2020 meeting is being advertised as focusing on seven themes: Fairer economies, better business, healthy futures, future of work, tech for good, beyond geopolitics and how to save the planet. Young climate activists and school strikers from around the world will be present at the event to put pressure on world leaders over that last theme.  The prince was speaking after launching an initiative, the Sustainable Markets Initiative and Council. His 10 proposals included the rapid decarbonisation of businesses, driving investment in new environmentally friendly technologies and helping consumers to make sustainable choices. Climate change, biodiversity loss and global warming are the greatest threats humanity has ever faced, he warned, adding that capital needs to be properly deployed in order to tackle these threats. The prince said global consumers could make markets sustainable, but could not make sustainable choices if these options were not clearly laid before them. Charles also warned that being socially and environmentally conscious cannot be an option for wealthier people only. Markets needed to change, so that prices actually reflected the environmental as well as economic costs. “If all the true costs are taken into account, being socially and environmentally responsible should be the least expensive option because it leaves the smallest footprint behind,” he argued, implicitly calling for subsidies and tax changes. Charles’s intervention comes nearly 30 years after he last spoke at the World Economic Forum, when he had already begun campaigning on environmental issues and corporate responsibility. He joked on Wednesday that it had been “an uphill struggle” trying to generate support but he believed the world was now at a turning point. The Prince of Wales arrived in an electric car – rather than the helicopter option favoured by some, such as Donald Trump. However, he reportedly travelled to Switzerland by private jet, a reminder of the gap between the goals outlined at the forum this week and the global elite’s behaviour. Environmental issues and the climate emergency have taken centre stage at Davos this year, with a stream of business leaders and politicians expressing concerns and signing up to initiatives to promote sustainability and climate action. But the meeting also exposed the split between the US and Europe on the issue, with Trump attacking “prophets of doom” in a speech heavily criticised by environmentalists. 1) Put nature and the protection of nature’s capital at the heart of operations. 2) Create responsible pathways to decarbonise to reach net zero, and for governments and businesses to set a clear plan for how they will decarbonise. 3) Reimagine industries through the lens of sustainable markets. 4) Identify game-changing technologies that can speed up the creation of a sustainable economy and eliminate barriers to change. 5) Remove subsidies that prevent the economy becoming more sustainable, and set taxes, policies and regulations in a way that catalyses sustainable markets. 6) Invest in science, technology, engineering and maths skills, and in research and development, to help bring emerging technologies to market. 7) Invest in nature as an economic driver of growth. 8) Agree unified metrics for measuring environmental, social and governance standards, to provide transparency to company’s supply chains. 9) Make it easier for consumers to see which products are ethical and sustainable. 10) Realign investing so it can support sustainability. This would direct trillions of pounds in pension funds, sovereign wealth funds into environmentally responsible projects that offer long-term value and rate of return."
"Some 250 years ago James Watt, then scientific instrument maker to the University of Glasgow, devised the separate steam condenser while ambling through Glasgow Green one spring morning in May 1765. If any single moment can be traced to the rise of fossil fuel consumption then it’s surely this. Watt’s quite brilliant insight was to improve the efficiency of steam power three-fold, arguably pushing Britain 60 years into the future. But not only could Watt’s new machine replace human labour in production, it could efficiently pump water from mines, thereby accelerating the extraction and consumption of coal. What was still mostly a boutique fuel for 18th-century industry and heating would become the fuel of choice to power industrial Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Now, due to the 21st-century climate risks associated with long-term fossil fuel consumption, the divestment movement is urging institutions to pull their investments from the fossil fuel industry. But those most vocal in calling for a blanket divestment from all fossil fuels often ignore the nuances of prior energy transitions, underestimate the scale of the challenge and some even oppose the growth of proven low-carbon technologies such as nuclear power. If climate is the issue and carbon is the problem, then it’s perhaps surprising that our energy economy has actually been decarbonising in relative terms for centuries. Not all fuels are alike, and historical energy transitions from wood to coal and then through oil, methane and nuclear have led to a steady fall in the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy delivered.  The underlying connection between these prior energy transitions has been a steady increase in the energy density of fuels, for example from carbon-rich coal to hydrogen-rich methane, which packs a greater energy punch weight-for-weight. Of course accumulated emissions have grown steadily during this period, but that’s due to the tight link between economic growth and energy consumption during rapid industrialisation. A pragmatic energy policy would therefore build on an acceleration of these historical long-waves of improving energy density. Such a programme would feature a large-scale shift from carbon-rich coal to hydrogen-rich methane and carbon-free nuclear, both of which can provide power on demand. Although renewables will no doubt play a significant role in the future, they are diffuse and so have a poor power density and work only intermittently, bucking the long-term historical trend. While nuclear can often directly replace coal, wind and solar still require fossil-fuelled plants to ensure electricity keeps flowing on still, cloudy days.  Industrial-scale batteries or other energy storage systems can be a partial solution, but they’re an additional capital cost to deal with intermittency and the scale of storage required is immense. But changes can also come from within the fossil-fuel industry itself. Only the oil and gas industry has both the capital and the engineering expertise to make coal cleaner through carbon capture and storage or partly replace carbon-rich coal with hydrogen-rich methane. Indeed moving from coal to methane as a fuel of choice is one of the easiest and most cost-effective energy transitions we could make in the near-term. This can clearly be seen through the significant decline in US emissions in recent years, which is largely due to cheap shale gas displacing coal. The very real success of the US shale gas industry in both economic and emission terms exposes a problem for the uncompromising position on all fossil fuels taken by the divestment movement. In terms of actual real-world divestment actions, it’s worth noting that Norway’s vast sovereign wealth fund has adjusted the spread of its energy portfolio, entirely divesting from coal but making careful reinvestments in oil and gas. Similarly, Shell’s recent acquisition of natural gas company BG Group underlines the push to replace coal with gas, following the long historical trend from carbon-rich to hydrogen-rich fuels.  The divestment movement also needs to deal head-on with its often highly contradictory views on nuclear energy. Veteran climate scientist Jim Hansen states that believing in a rapid transition away from fossil fuels using renewables alone is akin to “believing in the Easter Bunny”. He also slates many of the leading environmental groups as being one of the greatest obstacles to emission reductions due to their uncompromising anti-nuclear stance.  Simultaneously campaigning for divestment from all fossil fuels and an end to low-carbon nuclear energy reveals that, for some at least, the divest campaign is not simply about climate, it’s about a much broader agenda. If we’re serious about reducing carbon while delivering modern energy services for all, we need to focus on innovation. We should remember that when James Watt’s efficient new steam engine began to displace Thomas Newcomen’s earlier machine, it didn’t require top-down political targets or state incentives to encourage the take-up of the new technology. Watt’s idea succeeded simply because it required only one third as much coal to deliver the same quantity of mechanical work.  If we can develop cheaper, cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels over the coming decades which are truly scalable, then the subsequent fall in energy prices will reach our fellow citizens in the developing nations living with the impacts of permanent energy austerity and as a side effect the climate problem will ultimately solve itself. Finally, as we look to the future from the 250th anniversary of James Watt’s invention, we quickly need to rediscover his enlightenment-era inventiveness and reclaim the notion of a progressive, human-centred future. In the long twilight of the wood-burning era before James Watt we worked for energy, but now energy works for us, freeing us to pursue all that is good in our modern civilisation.  We also need to be clear that in the long-term, the deeply intertwined issues of energy and climate won’t be solved by climate science; they will be solved by engineering science, while global energy poverty will be solved by deflating, not inflating energy prices.  James Watt’s initial is stamped on every light bulb, measuring the power it delivers, but also reminding us of the intellectual light and sheer progress he brought to the world. Rather than obsess over the symbolism of divestment, this is what we need to invest in."

Yes, climate change is real.
But what they don’t tell us is that in many places that change has gone in the opposite direction of what alarmists like to have us think.
Moreover, that change is obviously driven far more by natural causes, such as solar and oceanic cycles, and has very little to do with man-made CO2.
Today we look at the untampered temperature datasets of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) that go back to 1988 and which are mostly complete.
Here’s the plot of the 6 stations with adequate data:

Data: JMA
Five of the 6 stations show cooling or no upward trend. Earlier predictions of rapid warming are proving to be false.
Next is a plot of 8 stations using data from NASA, which show notable cooling trend over the past 25 years:

Deep blue Vermont says no to Big Wind
When it comes to wind energy, we’re seeing strong signals against it coming from Vermont, a state that is as politically blue, and thus pro-green, as any state could possibly be.
One would think that the Green Mountain State would welcome “clean”, renewable wind energy and happily make its contribution to rescuing the climate and environment. Vermont, after all, is home to Bernie Sanders and Bill McKibben.
Ironically, Vermont’s strong environmental streak is backfiring on industrial wind. Vermont citizens are realizing industrial wind parks are not green after all, and aren’t worth defacing the rural landscape. Vermonters now more than ever want them the hell out.
For example, Windpower Engineering Development site here reports how Vermont’s political environment now “is hostile to wind energy”.
“In 2012, there were over a dozen wind projects in development. Now there are none. This is truly a sad state of affairs for Vermont,” stated David Blittersdorf, CEO and founder of AllEarth Renewables.
Large wind facilities banned
Meanwhile voters in the tiny Vermont village of Grafton have endorsed a new town plan that prohibits industrial and commercial wind, reports the Brattleboro Reformer here. “On a 95-66 vote during an all-day ballot Monday, residents approved the new town plan, which bans any large wind facility, and includes other planning updates.”
Also neighboring Windham has said “no” to industrial wind parks by developer Iberdrola, which has since “dropped its plans to build what would have been the largest wind project in the state of Vermont,” writes the Brattleboro Reformer.
Good to see Vermonters are finally waking up to the green energy madness and landscape blight and zero benefit it all leads to.

"Just because a country meets its emissions-reduction targets doesn’t mean it isn’t responsible for increased emissions elsewhere. This isn’t as weird as it sounds. The way national targets are calculated means some countries effectively “outsource” their emissions to other regions. If countries such as the UK don’t include the global emissions impact of their economy they run the risk of believing they are staving off climate change when they are not. Securing a “comprehensive, rules-based agreement” in Paris later this year is apparently one of the new UK government’s three priorities for energy and climate change – and this would no doubt include emissions targets. Such targets were also a key aspect of the previous coalition government’s intention to be the “greenest-ever”. It pledged to cut central government greenhouse gas emissions by 10% in the first year and to push Europe to increase the EU emission-reduction target to 30% by 2020. Greenhouse gas emissions are usually considered in terms of those emitted within national boundaries; for example by cars and industries. These “territorial emissions” are the basis of national commitments and governments can influence them through taxes or regulations on emissions.  In the UK, the general trend is towards a reduction in these territorial emissions, though it’s tough to say exactly what has happened over the past three years as there is a bit of a lag before annual statistics can be reported. However, it is instructive to take a wider perspective. Rather than considering the emissions that occur within the UK’s borders, we could think in terms of the emissions that are given off in the process of providing the goods and services enjoyed by its citizens.  This “consumption-based” perspective looks at the whole life cycle of products consumed in a nation and reveals that supporting British lifestyles actually causes the emission of far more greenhouse gases than those emitted in the UK alone. This is because the UK’s imported goods require, on average, more greenhouse gases to be emitted during their production than the goods it exports. While goods and services are imported, emissions are effectively “outsourced” to other nations. This matters because greenhouse gas emissions have a global impact – the UK will be affected just as much by one tonne of carbon emitted in Shanghai as Sheffield. The UK has developed and signed up to a number of strategies and targets to reduce emissions, most notably the Climate Change Act which legally obliges an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. However unless emissions are addressed on a global scale, we run the risk of frustrating the purpose of these strategies by shifting the burden from our shores to others. Looking at emissions based on consumption also gives us a clearer picture of which goods and services actually “drive” greenhouse gas pollution. It’s often not the processes directly responsible for the emissions. Steel, for example, requires lots of emissions to manufacture. But steel isn’t an end product – no one buys steel simply to own some metal. Rather demand for the alloy is driven by our demand for cars, white goods or buildings. This also applies to services; for example, the healthcare that we benefit from produces minimal emissions directly but relies on goods and services that result in far greater “upstream” emissions. We need to think in a more life cycle way in order to ensure we count impact effectively. This presents us with an opportunity. By reducing consumption of these goods and services and by making environmentally sound choices, we can have a far greater effect on global emissions. This can be seen clearly in the first chart above; between 2007 and 2009, the UK’s consumption-based emissions reduced far more dramatically than its territorial emissions have at any other time. This was, of course, due to the recession reducing imports of goods but these emissions remained at the lower level throughout 2010 and 2011. Reduced consumer confidence and deferrals in infrastructure investment will have played their part but the possibility of lower consumption-based emissions has been demonstrated and so there is the tantalising possibility of this lower emissions level persisting.  If so, this somewhat unintentional effect may turn out to be the most significant “green” achievement over this last government’s term. The challenge will be continuing this in the context of a stronger economy."

"Organizers in the youth climate movement plan an avalanche of activities beginning next week, determined to make the future of the climate the major issue of the 2020 election. Capitalizing on turnout in the September climate strikes, when 6 million people worldwide turned out to demand urgent action to address the escalating ecological emergency, young US organizers are making the leap from mobilization to demands. They’re planning widespread voter activation in the 2020 US presidential election as well as direct action targeting the fossil fuel industry and the banks and politicians that enable it.  “The headline message of the strikes in 2020 is: the kids are taking to the streets to strike for climate and they’re asking you to vote,” said Katie Eder, the executive director of Future Coalition, a communications and training hub for youth climate groups. There are more than 300 organizations involved in the efforts, Eder said, including some of the largest youth and adult coalitions in climate movement: Fridays for Future, the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, Zero Hour, Extinction Rebellion. “We’re starting to have the conversation within the strikes about how we’re balancing both the political targets and the financial targets,” Eder said, calling power and money “really key to the root causes of why we’re not addressing climate change”. Activists have planned widespread voter mobilization campaigns; three days of national strikes, marches, and direct action against politicians and banks beginning on Earth Day (22 April); regular strikes on Fridays and additional strikes targeting primary elections in every state; plus an international day of action, college divestment campaigns, and a huge push by the Sunrise Movement to turn out the vote for Bernie Sanders and a Green New Deal. Stories of climate awakening are a universal truth for young Americans living in the age of worsening climate conditions. Isabella Fallahi, who has asthma, for example, has lived within 14 miles of a coal-burning generating facility all of her life. “A lot of people don’t think of Indiana, or the midwest, for that matter, as frontline communities,” she said. “We face the silent killers. The terrible air quality because of mining projects, the terrible water quality because of mining projects, the health effects associated with both of those, droughts that cripple the agricultural economies that we’re based off of.” But Fallahi, like many other young organizers, is also galvanized by the tech proficiency of her generation, born into the era of hashtags and the ubiquitous touchscreen. She was a speaker at the UN climate change conference in Madrid (COP 25) in December 2019, when she and other youth were nearly ejected for protesting against the fossil fuel executives on panels and in negotiations. Approximately 200 young people in 40 countries, many of whom were at the conference, organized a response called Polluters Out. In 20 days, they had a website, a multilingual launch video, a press release in seven languages, and a list of demands. In actions set for March, they will call for the exclusion of fossil fuel interests at COP26 and transparency in the UN framework on climate change, as well as inclusion of indigenous and human rights in the Paris agreement. Regional efforts in the US will also call for a Green New Deal, a halt to new fossil fuel infrastructure, divestments from fossil fuels by universities and campaign funds, and the targeting of specific banks for fossil fuel investments. The groups stay in touch through conference calls, Slack, Zoom, and Google Drive. Activists in Cuba – who can’t download the apps because of the US trade embargo – tune in through WhatsApp. There’s a Slack channel for supporting scientists, too. And meetings wait for organizers in the Amazon who need to travel to towns for internet access. For all of them, there is community. People to cry with over the photo of the bay in Australia, so covered in smoke that it is hardly visible. “Overall, I think the way to look at this perspective on the youth movement is: it is cohesive in that they do communicate, but the orgs are not all the same,” said Natalie Mebane, associate director of US Policy for 350.org and an adult mentor for Zero Hour, both organizations intensely focused on voter turnout for climate for 2020. “We want to make sure that climate becomes the number one issue on voters’ minds.” The Sunrise Movement, like 350.org and Zero Hour, has taken that to a grassroots level. That is how Naina Agrawal-Hardin ended up in the guidance office at Washtenaw high school outside Ann Arbor, Michigan, for an interview. She’s a leader for the Ann Arbor hub of the Sunrise Movement. And she’s 16, a junior. Her school, she said, was supportive. “Whenever I have to take conference calls or interviews during school hours, they usually will write me a pass to get out of class,” she said. Agrawal-Hardin is planning a watch party at her home – a sneak peek at the forthcoming documentary Generation Green New Deal and a video about the Sunrise Movement’s 2020 campaign, as part of its annual kickoff. Sunrise provides the documentaries, discussion questions, and near-daily training on organizing and recruitment techniques. When Agrawal-Hardin hosts her event on 29 January, she’ll be one of more than 2,000 hosts nationwide. Through 2020, the Sunrise Movement will similarly activate its 300 chapters in support of Bernie Sanders, leveraging 10,000 volunteers in most of the 50 states for door knocks, voting pledges and climate education. Sunrise endorsed Sanders as the best-positioned candidate to lead a Green New Deal and address income inequality. “By primary/caucus day in Iowa and New Hampshire, we are going to have over 20,000 young people who have signed pledges to vote for Green New Deal champions” in the two states, said Sofie Karasek, a Sunrise Movement spokesperson. “What we’re really expecting to see in 2020 is Young Green New Deal voters really become the margin of victory for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee.”"
"The “thirst for oil” is often put forward as a near self-evident explanation behind military interventions in Libya, for instance, or Sudan. Oil, or the lack of oil, is also said to be behind the absence of intervention in Syria now and in Rwanda in 1994.   This of course clashes with the rhetoric around intervention, or its stated goal. No world leader stands before the UN and says they’re sending in the tanks because their country needs more oil. Such interventions are usually portrayed as serving directly non-economic goals such as preserving security, supporting democratic values, or more generally promoting human rights. But this is often met with scepticism and media claims that economic incentives played a key role. Was Iraq really “all about oil”? It’s worth asking whether this viewpoint has some mileage, or if it is instead purely conspiracy theory. It’s a question we’ve addressed in our research on the importance of oil production in attracting third party military interventions. In a new paper co-authored with Kristian Gleditsch in the Journal of Conflict Resolution we model the decision-making process of third-party countries in interfering in civil wars and examine their economic motives.  Our research builds on a near-exhaustive sample of 69 countries which had a civil war between 1945 and 1999. About two-thirds of civil wars during the period saw third party intervention either by another country or outside organisation. We found that the decision to interfere was dominated by the interveners’ need for oil – over and above historical, geographical or ethnic ties. Military intervention is expensive and risky. No country joins another country’s civil war without balancing the cost against their own strategic interests and what possible benefits there are.  We found countries producing lots of oil or those with higher reserves (and considerable market power) were more likely to attract military support. Most often this was to preserve oil prices on international markets. Indeed, there were on average more interventions in periods when there were only a few big oil producing countries and thus reduced competition (and more stable prices). Such interventions are more likely to be operated by countries highly dependent on oil imports. The US is the obvious example, but the USSR also fits this pattern – look at its intervention in oil-rich Indonesia in 1958, when Soviet oil production was still in its infancy. Consider also the UK’s military intervention in the Nigerian Civil War, also known as the Biafran War, between 1967 and 1970. At the time the UK was one of the largest net oil importers in the world, as North Sea oil production only started in 1975. The country also had, via BP, a direct interest in the stability of the region. It may seem tempting to attribute UK intervention in Nigeria to ties to its former colony. However, the UK did not intervene in civil wars in other, less oil-rich, former colonies such as Sierra Leone or Rhodesia (later Zimbabwe). On the flip side, oil independent nations don’t seem to do much intervening at all. The military aid Saudi Arabia provided to royalists during the civil war in 1960s Yemen is almost unique among the top exporting nations across the period we surveyed. The other Gulf states and regional oil powers such as Mexico or Indonesia have refrained from intervening in civil wars. The enduring record of geopolitical instability in oil producing regions and the likely increase in the global demand for oil means we’ll see more of these interventions in future. But there will be some differences. Shale gas should mean the US is becoming less energy dependent, whereas continued growth in China means the country will need energy imports more than ever. We’ll see some big changes in the specific states with the greatest incentives to intervene. We may see in coming years the first Chinese military assistance influenced by oil security. These interventions should in turn lead to stronger economic ties. Research we carried out with Leandro Elia, published in the Review of International Economics, found strong empirical evidence that US troop deployment and military aid provokes an expansion in bilateral trade flows.  Many claims are very often simplistic and are based on limited factual evidence, yet challenging them is best done by more rigorous and systematic analysis. Our work provides strong evidence that military interventions are indeed economically motivated."
"This year, more and more Australians are waking up to the need for change. Specifically, change on how we manage land and water to prepare for the fire season.  However, this change is not so simple. The logistics of such change are considerable, but they are not the biggest challenge. Instead, the biggest obstacles to creating change come in the form of those who profit from maintaining the system as it is, despite that system bringing little benefit to the country – either the people or the environment. The benefit this system brings is purely measured in terms of profit for the few and, in the eyes of the profiteers at least, far outweighs any and all other concerns. Waking up to a realisation that your political leaders may not actually have the best interests of the citizenry or the lands and waters we rely on at heart is a bitter pill for many to swallow. It can be hard to accept that their decisions are influenced more by lobby groups than by common sense or the greater good. Most Indigenous peoples are all too familiar with this reality, both in terms of promoting better management of land and water, and in dealing with the reality that governments do not have our best interests at heart. Some people have struggled to see a connection between Australia Day and the current concerns over Australia’s refusal to embrace climate change. The last Guardian article I wrote was met with countless people failing to understand how I could draw a connection to the colonial experiment that is Australia and the current situations that we find ourselves in. For me, however, they are intrinsically linked. For what single date better signifies all that is wrong with Australia than a country that blindly chooses to celebrate the worst of its own history? What date better paints a picture of a nation desperately clinging to an outdated colonial identity rather than embracing all that is special about the continent they now reside on and doing everything in its power to protect it? And indeed, what could be a better date to protest Australia’s inaction on climate change, inaction on Indigenous rights, inaction on putting the rights of the people in front of corporate interests? Despite conservative commentators wilfully pretending that opposition to Australia Day is solely about a date in the calendar, for at least the last 82 years since the first official Day of Mourning was held in Sydney, 26 January has provided a platform for Indigenous peoples to call for change. Be it in the form of self-determination, treaty, stopping Aboriginal deaths in custody, changing child removal practices, or any other number of issues. Australia Day protests, whether they are operating under the name of Invasion Day, Survival Day or Day of Mourning, have always been about highlighting injustice and rallying support to worthy causes. It is not simply a “White Australian v Indigenous peoples” issue, firstly because there’s lots of people living here who are neither, but also because there are millions of non-Indigenous people who support these calls for change and, to be fair to the other side, at least four Indigenous people who apparently want everything to stay how it is – probably more but conservative media only ever seem to bring out the same few for some reason. Change the Date has always been synonymous with Change the Nation, but as social media has brought this 80+ year-old debate into the mainstream, something seemed to have gotten lost in translation over the past few years, which is why many of us have abandoned the #Changethedate hashtag in favour of #Changethenation – to keep the conversation on track with what it has always been about. All that has changed this year with the fire season is that it has brought home, for many, the realities of a possible apocalyptic near-future for Australia if we do not change. Understanding how toxic patriotism has become in Australia is essential to this challenge. Patriotism that should be about a love of the land and people has become instead about a justification for bigotry and racism, about instilling hatred in the perceived “other”, and about providing a comfortable smokescreen for government looking after its own interests at the expense of the rest of us. That is why 26 January, the ultimate day for toxic patriotism, has always been the prefect day to call for change, to rally for support, to highlight problems and offer solutions, and to come together and grow the movement of those who want to change the nation for the better, because the only other option is to continue to blindly support the same course of action, the same way of thinking, that got us into this mess in the first place. Indigenous peoples are not the problem, but we may well be Australia’s best hope for a solution. • Luke Pearson is the founder of IndigenousX"

An airliner traveling from Chile to New Zealand early today was in for an near miss from something you wouldn’t expect.

Flaming space debris — the remains of a Russian satellite — came hurtling
back to Earth not far from a passenger jet on its way to Auckland, New Zealand.
Here’s further proof for the growing concern of the  increasing amounts of space junk orbiting our planet. From the article: ‘The pilot of a Lan Chile Airbus A340 … notified air traffic controllers at Auckland Oceanic Center after seeing flaming space junk hurtling across the sky just five nautical miles in front of and behind his plane…’

"Speak to someone working in conservation, almost anywhere in the world, and there is a good chance that Gerald Durrell played some role in inspiring them to their future career.  The naturalist and zookeeper, who died 20 years ago, was a great advocate for endangered species. Durrell was a regular on British TV for decades and a prolific author, with books translated into 31 languages. As a nine-year-old I was transported from my bedroom to the azure seas around Corfu, to watch the magical aquatic world from the gently bobbing “bootle bumtrinket” (the unforgettably named, home-made boat of Gerry’s childhood). Like so many others, my first impressions of what a rainforest is like – its smells and sounds – came from Gerald Durrell’s beguiling descriptions of his later trips throughout the tropics. Durrell’s accounts of his animal collecting expeditions in far flung countries can make the modern reader feel very slightly uncomfortable (in a way they might not be able to quite put a finger on). They were clearly written in, and for, a very different age.  However, in many ways Gerald Durrell was far ahead of his time. He believed that a zoo shouldn’t be simply a place for people to go and see unusual animals, but they should also play a real role in conservation and education. The success of his early books enabled him to found a zoo in Jersey, where he made breeding animals on the edge of extinction a major focus.  Durrell recognised that successful conservation of threatened species in the wild depended on the skills and dedication of people working in the countries where they were found. Back in 1984, he set up his international training centre (now the Durrell Conservation Academy). This brought government officials, those working for small, underfunded charities, and anyone else with a real influence over the future of the critically threatened species Durrell cared about, together in Jersey to exchange skills and learn new ones.  The real power of this approach was in creating a network of like-minded people around the world and ensuring conservationists on the ground had access to up to date methods and approaches. The academy has now trained 3350 conservationists from 135 countries. I have the privilege of working closely with the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust team in Madagascar: a dynamic crew of 45 conservationists delivering community-focused projects targeting threatened species across the island.  Durrell himself loved Madagascar, an island he described as “filled with magic”. The Trust has been active in the country now for nearly 30 years and their hard work has been very influential – though the threats to Madagascar’s dwindling natural habitats, so eloquently described in one of Durrell’s last books The Aye-Aye and I, remain pressing. Many have said that Durrell was a man who left the world a better place than he entered it. The trust which bears his name, and continues with his work and vision, have this week made an important step in trying to quantify the impact of that work. They have launched the Durrell Index, which tackles the difficult challenge of measuring and communicating their impact on biodiversity around the world.  Gerald Durrell’s biggest impact however is likely to be the hardest to measure. It is the millions of children inspired to care just a little more about wildlife, and it is the conservation professionals trained and supported by the Durrell Academy, working hard to protect animals and their habitats all around the world."
"Zero-carbon hydrogen has been injected into a UK gas network for the first time in a groundbreaking trial that could help to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The 20% hydrogen and natural gas blend is being used to heat 100 homes and 30 faculty buildings at Keele University in Staffordshire. Unlike natural gas, when hydrogen is burned it produces heat and water as opposed to carbon dioxide.  “Heat hasn’t been particularly decarbonised to date and it’s a very big challenge,” said Lorna Millington, the future networks manager at Cadent, the gas distribution network that led the £7m HyDeploy project. “The aim was to turn the theoretical evidence into something real and tangible that the consumers within the Keele network are now getting to experience every day.” Heating homes and businesses accounts for half of the UK’s energy consumption and a third of its carbon dioxide emissions. Rolling the 20% hydrogen blend out across the country could save about 6m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year, the equivalent of taking 2.5m cars off the road. The hydrogen is captured using an electrolyser, which runs electricity through water to split it back into hydrogen and oxygen. This can then be injected into existing modern gas networks, with no need for customers to change appliances or pipework. The Health and Safety Executive granted the project exemption in 2018 from the current 0.1% limit on hydrogen in the UK gas network after an extensive examination of evidence to ensure it would be safe. Keele University was identified as an ideal location, because it owns and operates a private gas network that can be isolated from the main network. Two years of preparation involved gas safety checks on all buildings in the trial, laboratory tests on gas appliances and research on the effect of hydrogen on materials found in the gas network. All appliances sold after 1996 must be able to sustain 23% hydrogen under current regulations. “The materials we use in our network are actually more than capable of dealing with the levels of hydrogen that we were looking at,” said Millington. The trial will run until July and if successful a pilot will be rolled out in the north-east to deliver the 20% hydrogen blend to 670 domestic and commercial properties in Winlaton, Gateshead. Mark Horsley, the chief executive officer at Northern Gas Networks, said: “We’re really excited about the opportunity. There is a strong groundswell for decarbonisation, and I think opportunities for each individual home to contribute to that is quite powerful.” The pilot, the first of its kind in the UK, would start in December and run for 10 months. Customers have already been notified about the upcoming change. “Early indications are that it’s going to be very positively received,” said Horsley. The project is part of global exploration into the potentials of a “hydrogen economy”, in which the gas could also be used to generate electricity and produce heat with benefits for transport, heavy industry and domestic energy use. The energy needed to produce hydrogen from water can be provided by solar, hydro or wind power to produce “green hydrogen”, but there are challenges in doing so at scale. It still may be some time before the technology can be rolled out nationally, but “the 20% is a massive step forward for us as an industry and for the UK in achieving that net zero goal”, Horsley said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his German news commentary site, Gabor Steingart reports on the results of the latest ARD German public broadcasting trend analyses. Here it’s clear that German citizens are speaking loud and clear on the topic of climate protection: not so fast!
Rush to Green Deal without support
Lately the media and politicians have been pushing hard to start a fundamental change of society to a low-carb, de-industrialized organic garden society. For example, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen just announced a 1 TRILLION euro plan to decarbonate the continent.
Yet, public support for such an ambitious and adventurous transformation project appears to be rather soft at best in Germany.
According to Steingart:
Only 27 percent of Germans regard climate protection as a political priority. 73 percent have other concerns. Outside of the green voters (currently 23 percent in surveys), the alarmism of politicians (“climate emergency”) and scientists (“ecocide”) meets with discontent. The people want to say to the grand coalition government: Don’t throw the baby out with the bath.”
Greenland sets new record low

While 2019 is the warmest year in Australia since records began, as the Office of Meteorology stated in its annual climate report, Greenland has set a new record for cold temperatures: minus 66 degrees C.”
Mother Nature tricks Europe
Meanwhile, parts of central Europe have been experiencing record warm January temperatures, and thus reinforce the collective public’s impression that the global climate is out of whack. It’s not.
How unfortunate that Mother Nature would play such a mean trick on Europe. Everywhere else it’s pretty much winter as usual:

Now European policymakers are going to have an easier time getting the public to accept the EU “Green Deal”. Boy, are they in for a cold awakening.

"When the Spanish conquered South America in the 16th century they took over the Incas’ mines and soon began to pump clouds of lead dust over the Andes. The silver the conquistadors sent back home made them wealthy. It also made them the world’s first industrial-scale toxic metal air polluters – perhaps causing us to rethink the timing of the moment when humans truly began to change the environment. Formal recognition of the Anthropocene epoch, the “Age of Humans”, will acknowledge the occurrence of an unprecedented impact of human activities on Earth. As scientists, we’ve begun using the term informally, especially in regard to anthropogenic (“human-caused”) climate change. Officially, though, we all live in the Holocene, the epoch named by geologists to mark the end of the last ice age. To officially say that we live in the Anthropocene – that is, declare the Holocene over and the Anthropocene already underway – we would have to draw an unequivocal line between the two. We’d have to agree on a point in time when human impacts on the environment became large enough to warrant an official change in scientific nomenclature. Some would assign it to the start of agriculture 11,000 years ago, while others tie it to the advent of the nuclear era in 1945, but most recognise the Anthropocene as beginning with the industrial revolution (1780s-1830s). However we now have evidence, from an ice core of the Quelccaya Ice Cap in Peru, of anthropogenic pollution of the South American atmosphere that precedes the industrial revolution by around 240 years. The discovery by my colleagues and I, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, underscores the difficulty in defining the onset of the Anthropocene. While we have plenty of information from around the world about pollution during the industrial period, pre-industrial pollution records are very rare. We have to look to special places on Earth where atmospheric chemicals would have been preserved chronologically, such as lake sediments or the accumulated snow on an ice cap. Quelccaya is one of those places. The largest ice sheet in the tropics is a fast-melting poster child for global warming. It’s also a perfect place to learn more about the past climate and environment – the ice core we drilled there in 2003 contained more than 1,200 years of accumulated atmospheric chemistry.  South America has a rich history of mining and metallurgy. We wondered, would the ice record evidence of ancient metallurgical activity? Air pollution would have to have existed on a truly continental scale to drift on the air from the heart of South American metallurgy in Bolivia across the Andes and onto Quelccaya, some 800 km away. It did. The story of South American metallurgy – from the rise of the Inca Empire to the Spanish conquest and even the industrial stagnation that followed the end of Spanish rule – is written in the ice. Like the native peoples before them, the Inca gathered metal ore from outcrops or exposed veins and smelted it in primitive wind-driven furnaces called huayra. The Quelccaya core first records evidence of pollution from Inca metallurgy around 1480 in the form of trace amounts of bismuth, likely released into the atmosphere during the creation of bismuth bronze, an alloy which has been recovered from the Inca citadel at Machu Picchu. Remarkably, no increases of other trace elements are apparent in the Quelccaya ice record during that period, indicating that the well-known metallurgic activities performed during the Inca reign had a negligible impact on the South American atmosphere. The Spanish conquistadors lead by Francisco Pizarro defeated the Incas in 1532, starting the colonial period of South America. Silver smelting quickly became the most important industrial activity on the continent, and the Spanish used imported and inefficient Castilian stone furnaces as well as thousands of local huayras as silver extraction spread across Bolivia and Peru. Increases in lead levels in the Quelccaya ice core date to approximately 1540 and document this initial phase of Spanish metallurgy. In 1572, the Spanish introduced a new technique called amalgamation, which allowed them to process even low-quality ores that contained much more lead than silver. This cold technique involved grinding the ore into powder, which could easily have become airborne. We believe this accounts for the sudden and dramatic spike in lead concentrations in the ice core starting around that time. Even the independence war of 1833, which marked the end of Spanish rule, is recorded in the ice. Elsewhere in the world, the industrial revolution was booming – and air pollution growing. But at Quelccaya, lead levels fell and remained low for years after the war, likely due to army destruction of mines in Bolivia and Peru and the post-war lack of infrastructure. The ice provides a detailed record of more than 1,000 years of South American history that can inform discussions of the Anthropocene timeline.  Did it spread out through South America with the trace bits of pollution from the Incas’ bismuth bronze? Or the lead concentrations from increased smelting upon the Spanish arrival? Or perhaps the more dramatic pollution created in the era of amalgamation marks the turning point. This discovery suggests that our new epoch emerged sporadically through space and time, at different points during human history. Only as we connect the Quelccaya ice core to records elsewhere on Earth can we assemble a clearer picture of the dawn of the Anthropocene."

By Die Kalte Sonne

A good six years ago, Potsdam climate researcher Stefan Rahmstorf was outraged by the German Weather Service (DWD) at his at Klimalounge site.
The DWD had the audacity to contradict Mr. Rahmstorf. Specifically, it was about the presumed connection between the expansion of Arctic sea ice and cold winter weather. Rahmstorf’s simple model: Less Arctic sea ice causes cold European winters. At the time, he led a conglomeration of studies and claimed:
In my view, the above studies provide clear evidence of a link between Arctic ice loss due to global warming, and more frequent winter high pressures, particularly over the Atlantic-European part of the Arctic, and the associated influx of cold air into Europe. As we have often experienced it in recent winters – for example spectacularly in the first half of February 2012.”
In the process Rahmstorf became verbally wild and didn’t hold back dishing it out: The DWD was embarrassing, incompetent in questions of climate change, that it could not even read scientific papers, the arguments were flat. It was an unusually aggressive style of discussion that is seldom encountered in science. Rahmstorf original:
However, the taz quoted [German paper] yesterday the spokesman of the German Weather Service [DWD in German] as saying that if there was a direct relationship with the sea ice cover,  the entire winter would have to be very cold in Germany.  I think this trivial argument with which he would like to wipe from the table the climate research results shown above  is pretty embarrassing for the DWD.  Of course open water in the Arctic does not prevent stochastic weather variability. There will always be warm and cold periods. In all these studies it comes down to changing probabilities in the prevailing weather patterns: Petoukhov and Semenov estimate that the probability of cold winter extremes could triple, that is even in the Abstract. One wonders whether the DWD representative has read the relevant studies at all – and if not, why he feels the urge to comment on them in the media. Unfortunately, it has a certain tradition that meteorologists dealing with weather, are not familiar with climate science.”
More than half a decade has passed by since Rahmstorf’s rumblings. In the meantime, research has taken up the topic professionally and now has certainty: Rahmstorf was completely off the mark. Sea ice does not play a major role in the cold waves. Press release of the University of Exeter from August 12, 2019:

Arctic sea-ice loss has “minimal influence” on severe cold winter weather, research shows
The dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice through climate change has only a ‘minimal influence’ on severe cold winter weather across Asia and North America, new research has shown.
The possible connection between Arctic sea-ice loss and extreme cold weather – such as the deep freezes that can grip the USA in the winter months – has long been studied by scientists. Observations show that when the regional sea-ice cover is reduced, swathes of Asia and North America often experience unusually cold and hazardous winter conditions. However, previous climate modelling studies have suggested that reduced sea ice cannot fully explain the cold winters.
Now, a new study by experts from the University of Exeter, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and the Energy and Sustainability Research Institute in Groningen, has shed new light on the link between sea-ice loss and cold winters. For the research, the international team combined observations over the past 40 years with results from sophisticated climate modelling experiments. They found that the observations and models agreed that reduced regional sea ice and cold winters often coincide which each other.
They found that the correlation between reduced sea ice and extreme winters across the mid-latitude occurs because both are simultaneously driven by the same, large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns. Crucially, it shows that reduced sea ice only has a minimal influence on whether a harsh and severe winter will occur. The study is published in leading science journal, Nature Climate Change.
Dr Russell Blackport, a Mathematics Research Fellow at the University of Exeter and lead author of the paper said: ‘The correlation between reduced sea ice and cold winters does not mean one is causing the other. We show that the real cause is changes in atmospheric circulation which moves warm air into the Arctic and cold air into the mid-latitudes.’ Over recent decades, the Arctic region has experienced warming temperatures through climate change, which has led to a large decline in sea-ice cover. This reduction in sea-ice cover means that areas of open water increase, which in turn allows the ocean to lose more heat to the atmosphere in winter – this can potentially alter the weather and climate, even well outside the Arctic.
Recent studies have suggested that the reduced sea ice or Arctic warming has contributed to recent cold winters experienced in the mid-latitude region – and that as the sea-ice reduces further through climate change, cold winters will become more frequent and severe. Now, this new study suggests that reduced sea ice is not the main cause of the cold winters. Instead, the cold winters are likely caused by random fluctuations in the atmospheric circulation.
Professor James Screen, an Associate Professor in Climate Science at the University of Exeter said: ‘The are many reasons to be concerned about the dramatic loss of Arctic sea ice, but an increased risk of severe winters in North America and Asia is not one of them.’ Dr John Fyfe, a Research Scientist at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, who was not involved in the research, writes in Nature Climate Change: ‘Blackport and colleagues put to rest the notion that Arctic sea-ice loss caused the cold mid-latitude winters, showing instead that atmospheric circulation changes preceded, and then simultaneously drove sea-ice loss and mid-latitude cooling.’
Minimal influence of reduced Arctic sea ice on coincident cold winters in mid-latitudes by Russell Blackport, James Screen, Karin van der Wiel and Richard Bintanja is published in Nature Climate Change. It was funded through a grant by the Natural Environment Research Council.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterToday, 30% of the globe’s CO2 emissions come from China. In 10 years, China’s emissions alone will match the rest of world’s emissions combined. China continues to build hundreds of coal plants today. So why are the rest of us spending $600 billion every year on CO2 emissions mitigation?
China overtook the United States as the world’s largest CO2 emitter in 2008 (Liu et al., 2019).

It only took 7 years for China’s emissions percentage to double that of the USA’s. As of 2015, China accounted for 30% of global emissions (Shan et al., 2018) compared to the USA’s 15%.
Much of the reason for China’s emissions domination is because its citizens consume more than 50% of the world’s coal.
China is in the process of building 100s of new coal plants, with plans to add a new coal plant every 2 weeks for the next 12 years.
According to the People’s Daily, China, the country’s longest coal transporting railway, carrying 200 million tonnes of coal from north to east China every year, is now (October, 2019) in operation.

Due to its exponentially-growing energy demands, China will be responsible for 50% of the globe’s CO2 emissions within 10 years (Liu et al., 2019).
Why should the rest of us spend $89 trillion to reduce CO2 emissions?
According to proponents of CO2 mitigation policies, the cost of infrastructure changes required to reduce CO2 emissions to acceptable levels is $89 trillion by 2030.

Per a scolding, we’re-not-spending-enough-on-climate article published in the journal Nature, we’re already spending about $600 billion annually on CO2 mitigation.
“[T]otal climate-related financing was $510 billion to $530 billion in 2017,” which is much higher than the $360 billion spent in 2012. “The UN’s Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), put it at $681 billion in 2016” (Yeo, 2019).
So we’re spending 100s of billions to 10s of trillions to reduce CO2 emissions in Western countries.
Meanwhile, China continues to build hundreds of new coal plants and grow its carbon-intensive infrastructure, thwarting any and all efforts to reduce net global emissions.
Why are we doing this?

1000 billion euros
The new EU President of the European Commission said she wanted to present a plan called The Green Deal that would cost 1000 billion euros over the next decade in order reduce the European Union’s (EU) greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990.
According to Ursula Von der Leyen, “The European Green Deal is Europe’s new growth strategy. It will reduce emissions while creating jobs and improving our quality of life. To do that, we need investments…. To do that, we will come up with a plan.”
Von der Leyen also announced a European climate law slated March 2020 which would make the transition to carbon neutrality… “irreversible”.
She added: “If some people talk about costs, we should always keep in mind the extra costs if we do not act now.”
Up to 300 billion euros per year
Frans Timmermans, Executive Vice-President of this Commission in charge of the Green Deal, told a press conference in Brussels that these investments would be “a combination of public money, loans and private money” estimated to run as high and 300 billion euros per year.

Public services will be hit hard
But Contrepoints writes that no matter wehere the money comes from, it will have a “siphoning effect” and thus “will be missing elsewhere where it might be more useful (health, public services, national security…).”
The EU’s new leadership is calling on Europe to be climate-neutral by 2050.
Taxpayers will pick up the tab
As to who will pay, Contrepoints says “in the end taxpayers and consumers will be largely involved, as usual.” Then, everyone will benevolently ask themselves “Why are local services disappearing? Why are taxes going up? And why is my standard of living falling?”
Collusion capitalism
Contrepoints calls the new EU Green Deal “collusion capitalism”, which describes an economy where business success depends on close relations with representatives of power: governments, and various commissions.”
“The aim is to create a climate of favoritism, for example, when it comes to the allocation of permits, government subsidies or tax cuts. It appears when cronyism, including ideological cronyism, pervades politics and elected officials,” comments Contrepoints. “It leads to collusion between elected officials and market players, in particular to win public contracts, obtain subsidies and guide legislation. Some of these systems are formalized and dominate an entire economy, but they are generally more subtle.”
Contrepoints writes that with 1000 billion euros to distribute, it will be necessary “to have to have friends at the European Commission to prosper in the shadow of all this public money.”
And due to the high costs and burdens, Contrepoints warns that Europe, with Germany now leading the charge, “wants to accelerate into a dead end!”
