Share this...FacebookTwitterIn a recently released video interview by journalist Jörg Rehmann, University of Magdeburg economics professor Joachim Weimann explains why renewable energies have been a terrible idea for Germany so far.
Recently a high ranking expert commission set up by the German government even sharply criticized the German Energiewende (transition to renewable energies), saying it was leading the country down the wrong path. But as Prof. Weimann explains, the commission’s results fell on deaf ears.

Weimann starts the interview by explaining that the target of the Energiewende is to replace carbon-dioxide-emitting fossil fuels in order to protect our climate. One instrument used to achieve that target was Cap and Trade, in combination with the Energiewende, which Weimann says has not worked well at all. The U. of Magdeburg professor says that every cut that gets achieved in Germany gets offset elsewhere, and so net CO2 gets saved at all.
Weimann says that over the years policymakers promised and obstinately insisted that renewables were the way to go, and so ended up putting themselves in a position of which it is now impossible to back out. What leading politician is going to step forward and tell us that it was all a big mistake? “We find ourselves in quite a bind, says Weimann.
Weimann recommends that citizens step up and tell their leaders that what is currently happening is not in their interest, and that they need to exert influence media reporting on the issue. Weimann says:
It is very very difficult. Currently we have over 1000 citizens intiatives against wind power in Germany, yet they practically go unmentioned in media reporting. Compared to the resistance to nuclear energy, it is a crass disproportion. This shows us just how difficult it is to bring the issue to the forefront.”
Weimann hopes that the protests will grow until a critical mass is reached, and can no longer be ignored.
The professor points out that for years a number of institutions and experts have shown that the feed-in act is not functioning properly, that it wastes resources, and is bad policy that is having no impact on climate protection. He adds that the feed-in act entails extremely high costs, not only in terms of capital but also in terms of damage to the country’s landscape. “That means we are producing costs, and no yields. That is not good policy,” says Weimann.

Policymakers, in Weimann’s view, have long been ignoring what the scientific data and experts have told us with respect to renewable energies, but that they are refusing to back out it because they are so far deep into it and that it would be too embarrassing to do so.
Public kept in the dark by media, policymakers
According to Weimann, 80% of the German population are still in favor of renewable energies because they are not aware of the near zero-impact it is having on CO2 emissions and because they are poorly informed. It is in fact only when a wind park gets proposed nearby does a citizen really begin to get interested in what really is at stake and finds out what the true implications are. “Then they suddenly recognize the nonsense that is in fact happening.”
In Weimann’s view, renewable energy topics and calculations are far too complicated for the average citizen to deal with when they don’t feel they have to.
Total destruction of our landscape
Weimann notes that according to the Ministry of Environment, wind and solar energy in 2016 made up only 3.3% of Germany’s primary energy supply and that so far it represents only a “thimble” of the energy that is needed. And “when you compare it to the cost needed for it, not only financial, but also in terms of the burdens to the citizens who have these energy systems next door, we have to say it is first totally disproportional, and secondly that if we wish to meet our targets using wind, it would mean the total destruction of our landscape.”
So far only 3.3% of our primary energy need is being supplied by wind (28,000 turbines so far) and solar. Weimann asks us to imagine what it would take to reach the 95% target. He says the entire German landscape would be profoundly and fundamentally transformed into one massive industrial park that would lose all its attraction. In short: It’s a policy calamity.
Those were just some of Weimann’s comments and claims in just the first 17 minutes of the interview. More on this soon.

Meanwhile subsidies for wind and solar energy have increasingly come under fire with one wind protest group director, who recently blasted their extravagance.
According to the kreisbote.de here, Reinhold Faulhaber, Chairman of nature protection group Initiative Landschaftsschutz Kempter Wald and Allgäu e.V. (ILKA), demanded an end to the crazy subsidies for wind turbines at a membership meeting, saying that they do not lead to any CO2 savings, damage nature and that they are horrifically expensive:
If the milk business were subsidized like wind turbines are by the EEG feed-in act, our farmers would be getting 11.30 euros for every liter!“
That translates to near 50 US dollars a gallon – for the farmer! Imagine the retail price.
This illustrates just how out of whack the whole renewable energy movement has become. Economic sense has long been thrown overboard.

"A handful of US states – including New Mexico and California – are facing significant strains on their water supplies that will only intensify with global heating, according to new rankings. New Mexico tops the list and is the only state with “extremely high” pressures on its water availability. The state’s score is on par with the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East and Eritrea in Africa, the World Resources Institute (WRI) found. California ranks second, followed by Arizona, Colorado and Nebraska. “We’re stretching our water supply pretty much as far as it can go … and even further,” said Leah Schleifer, a spokeswoman for WRI’s water program. Experts with WRI said the data shows a global water crisis. “The picture is alarming in many places around the globe, but it’s very important to note that water stress is not destiny,” said Betsy Otto, WRI’s global water director. “What we can’t afford to do any longer is pretend that the situation will resolve itself.” The global research organization compared the water available in aqueducts to the amount withdrawn for homes, industries, irrigation and livestock. Around the world, stress on water supplies can exacerbate conflict and migration, threaten food supplies and pose risks for water-dependent industries, including mining and manufacturing, WRI notes. The US overall is not among the world’s most at-risk countries, although Mexico ranks No 24. A 2010 study predicted that climate-driven changes in crop yields in Mexico would lead to more emigration to the United States. And the global climate crisis is increasingly being recognized as a major factor in the exodus from Central America to the US. Worldwide, at the top of the list are Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and Iran. A total of 17 countries are facing “extremely high” risks and another 27 are facing “high” risks. Scientists have also linked the violence and civil war in Syria to a drought driven by rising temperatures and massive water withdrawals. In the African Sahel, a semi-arid region that stretches coast to coast across northern Africa below the Sahara, they have documented similar water stresses as millions have migrated out of the countryside. WRI’s experts explained that water stress is different from drought. But places where people are using water at a faster rate than it is replaced could see serious problems if they hit a drought – or a prolonged period without enough rain. “With respect to climate change we know that in many places what we’re going to be seeing is more erratic, more unpredictable hydrology, precipitation. Either too much or too little, often in the same places,” Otto said. The mid-latitudes around the globe are likely to receive less rainfall as temperatures rise. And they will be using more water, as crops draw up more water during dry periods and people use water-dependent electricity to run air conditioners, Otto said. A recent analysis of 12m wells in the US found that as groundwater supplies are depleted, people and industry are digging deeper. Researchers called the trend an “unsustainable stopgap” that is only available to those who can afford it and where hydrologic conditions allow. The last widespread drought in the US was in 2012, when more than 80% of the country experienced abnormal dryness or worse, and two-thirds of the country experienced drought, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist for the agriculture department. California saw an extended drought with conditions beginning in 2011 and not subsiding across the state until the last couple of years. The state is expected to see huge population growth at the same time temperatures could be 5F warmer, sea levels keep rising and water from melting snowpack declines, said Joaquin Esquivel, chairman of the California water resources control board. In the 2010s, drought hit the US islands of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In 2016 it swept through the north-east. And in 2017 made its way through the northern plains. Today, south-east Alaska’s rainforest is feeling the most intense drought in the country. World Bank research has emphasized that “while the consequences of drought are often invisible, they are significant and cause ‘misery in slow motion.’”"

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In September 2016 an exciting paper by a team led by Katinka Bellomo was published in the Geophysical Research Letters.
It described a climate amplifier for the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) based on clouds. According to the study, the cloud effect accounts for up to one third of the AMO associated temperature change. The abstract:
New observational evidence for a positive cloud feedback that amplifies the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) affects climate variability in the North Atlantic basin and adjacent continents with potential societal impacts. Previous studies based on model simulations and short-term satellite retrievals hypothesized an important role for cloud radiative forcing in modulating the persistence of the AMO in the tropics, but this mechanism remains to be tested with long-term observational records. Here we analyze data sets that span multiple decades and present new observational evidence for a positive feedback between total cloud amount, sea surface temperature (SST), and atmospheric circulation that can strengthen the persistence and amplitude of the tropical branch of the AMO. In addition, we estimate cloud amount feedback from observations and quantify its impact on SST with idealized modeling experiments. From these experiments we conclude that cloud feedbacks can account for 10% to 31% of the observed SST anomalies associated with the AMO over the tropics.”
In the same journal already in February 2016, an article by Tianle Yuan et al appeared on the same topic. The authors called out that the climate models were not able to reproduce the AMO ocean cycle in the tropics. They then described amplification mechanism through low-lying clouds that could incorporate the AMO into the models. The abstract follows:
Positive low cloud and dust feedbacks amplify tropical North Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is characterized by a horseshoe pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and has a wide range of climatic impacts. While the tropical arm of AMO is responsible for many of these impacts, it is either too weak or completely absent in many climate model simulations. Here we show, using both observational and model evidence, that the radiative effect of positive low cloud and dust feedbacks is strong enough to generate the tropical arm of AMO, with the low cloud feedback more dominant. The feedbacks can be understood in a consistent dynamical framework: weakened tropical trade wind speed in response to a warm middle latitude SST anomaly reduces dust loading and low cloud fraction over the tropical Atlantic, which warms the tropical North Atlantic SST. Together they contribute to the appearance of the tropical arm of AMO. Most current climate models miss both the critical wind speed response and two positive feedbacks though realistic simulations of them may be essential for many climatic studies related to the AMO.”
While on the subject of clouds, for German speakers the following 2 videos can be viewed until January 21, 2017 can be watched on ZDF German television:

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German climate activist/alarmist site Klimaretter (climate rescuers) here has an opinion piece telling readers that there is in fact little difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton when it comes the energy policy. “Eco-green or coal-black? It really isn’t that simple.”
Klimaretter writes that while it may appear Trump wishes to save the American coal industry and Clinton promises to promote “clean energies”,  the two candidates have many more similarities’ than what meets the eye:
In fact there are more common points between the two than what their rhetoric would have us believe. Both Clinton and Trump wish to hold on to the controversial fracking technology for natural gas  and crude oil. The same is true for nuclear power.
Trump has long since added on to his pro-coal course by coming out in favor of ‘all types of energy’. Also solar and wind energy would also play a role under his administration. It’s a balancing act for the billionaire: Of course he wishes to gain the votes from the many unemployed coal workers, however he has in fact understood that renewable energies has become a good economic engine, and in the meantime offers more jobs than the coal industry.
Trump even appears to be worried that there might indeed be something behind climate change: One of his companies wants to build a protective wall around his golf course on the Irish coast. Rising sea level and increasing erosion necessitate it…”
Klimaretter’s opinion could be the case of a climate alarmist trying to see a silver lining in a Trump presidency. Let’s recall that Trump said he would stop payments to the UN climate programs, not sign the climate treaty, and rev up the American economic engines (hence more CO2 emissions).
Clinton would do the opposite.
Hillary Clinton would also very likely shackle the economy with massive environmental regulation and possibly even impose a carbon tax. These are points that Klimaretter would surely welcome.

"A university has banned the sale of beef in campus food outlets in order to help tackle the climate emergency. Goldsmiths, University of London, is also attempting to phase out single-use plastics and installing more panels to power its buildings in New Cross, as part of a move to become carbon neutral by 2025.  Beef products will no longer be available in the institution’s cafes and shops when the academic year begins in September, while an additional 10p levy will be added to the sale of bottled water and disposable plastic cups to discourage their use. Prof Frances Corner, who took up the post of Goldsmiths’ warden this month, said the college would also switch to a completely clean energy supplier when its current contract ends and look into how all students could take curriculum options related to the climate crisis. A psychology undergraduate, Isabelle Gosse, 20, said she thought the move was “a really good start to being more environmentally friendly”. She added: “I think it’s a really positive move – Goldsmiths is recognising its own power and accountability in being more environmentally conscious. “Banning the sale of beef meat on campus, phasing out single-use plastics and the other pledges that the new warden has made highlights the current climate emergency that the world is facing.” Scientists behind the most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet found that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest way to reduce humans’ environmental impact. Previous research had revealed that the environmental impact of beef dwarfs that of other meat including chicken and pork. Corner said: “Though I have only just arrived at Goldsmiths, it is immediately obvious that our staff and students care passionately about the future of our environment and that they are determined to help deliver the step change we need to cut our carbon footprint drastically and as quickly as possible.” From 1 December, Goldsmiths’ endowment fund will also cease to hold investments in companies that generate more than 10% of their revenue from fossil fuel extraction. Joe Leam, the president of Goldsmiths’ union, said: “Banning beef is a bold move. Phasing out plastics and going to fully renewable energy are brilliant too. “The aim of being carbon neutral by 2025 is a great aim – let’s hope the management hold true to this. There is always more that can be done – but I think it’s a great start and other institutions should learn from this move.” Rosie Rogers, a climate emergency campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “It’s encouraging to see an institution like Goldsmiths not simply declaring a climate emergency, but acting on it. “From energy use, to food sales and plastic pollution – all universities and organisations with campus sites can make changes across their facilities that are better for our planet. “We call on others to urgently follow suit, and to include cutting all ties from fossil fuel funding in their climate emergency response.” The university’s pledge comes as part of a growing number of UK universities trying to reduce their carbon footprint. Last year, the University of Sheffield opened a zero waste shop – selling everything from unpackaged spices and herbs to laundry detergent. The university, which has also reduced its carbon emissions by 31% since 2005, completely divested from fossil fuel companies in February. At Cardiff University, students and staff are no longer provided with disposable plastic cups at water fountains, while takeaway coffee cups in its cafes are now recyclable and smoothie cups are compostable. Manchester Metropolitan University, where 60% of university vehicles are low emission, holds a clothes and book swap each term to encourage sustainable living."

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhen Michael Mann and the IPCC coordinated efforts to make the Medieval Warm Period disappear from the paleoclimate record in the early 2000s, they employed the visually slick and effective tactic of adding red to the “dangerous” warming trend, and blue to the “safe” cooling trend.  The original Mann et al. (1998, 1999) graph that claimed to reconstruct  surface temperatures for the entire Northern Hemisphere (by extrapolating from a few select trees located in North America) was published without color.  The graph’s red “hockey stick” blade effectively allowed readers to see for themselves just how “dangerous” modern warming really is .

The IPCC has since abandoned Michael Mann’s (Mann et al., 1998, 1999) artwork depicting late-1990s Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures as +0.9°C warmer than they were during Medieval times.  (For example, the 2013 IPCC report even acknowledges that many NH regions were as warm or warmer than present during the “Medieval Climate Anomaly”.)
Removing the Mann “hockey stick” graph from the paleoclimate record has come at a cost, though.  In many of the graphs of the Middle and Late Holocene constructed since then (with some exceptions), it has become much more difficult to distinguish between warming that is “safe” (for example, warming that will not endanger the lives of polar bears) and warming that is “dangerous” (for example, warming that will endanger the lives of polar bears).
The difficulty distinguishing between “safe” and “dangerous” warming arises because, unlike Mann’s “hockey stick” graph, many recent millennial-scale reconstructions just don’t show enough of a difference between the past climate and the present one to know which is which.   In fact, many reconstructions depict the 20th/21st centuries as not any warmer — and in some cases, cooler — than temperatures from a few hundred to a few thousand years ago.  This makes the detection of “dangerous” warming even more problematic.
Although it helps to add the color red to aid in deciphering which warming trend is “dangerous” and which is “safe”, sometimes even the additional coloration isn’t  enough to tell a difference.  For example, consider Esper et al. (2012) .  In the main graph from the paper (a), the authors redden the 20th/21st centuries to aid in identifying the warming that is “dangerous” versus that which is blue and thus “safe”.    However, the long-term trend is one of cooling, not warming, and the secondary graph (b) even shows that Northern Europe has been cooling overall since the 1940s or so.  This can become confusing for the reader concerned about detecting “dangerous” warming.
Esper et al., 2012

So . . . as a service to those who may not be able to find the “dangerous” warming in modern scientific publications, below is a helpful guide with easy-to-understand pointing devices (arrows),  labeling (“Safe” versus “Dangerous Warming”), and red coloration embedded into the paper’s graphs.   The consistently-used bright red hue on the arrow tracking the graph’s “Dangerous Warming” allows readers to locate the “Dangerous Warming” right away — without needing to scan the entire graph.   With practice and repetition using these 20+peer-reviewed scientific papers, the average reader will ultimately become adept at distinguishing between the “dangerous” warming that kills polar bears and the “safe” warming that doesn’t kill polar bears.

“Peak Holocene temperatures occurred prior to 5.0 ka [5,000 years ago], a time when overall aquatic and terrestrial biological production was high. Chironomid-inferred summer air temperatures reached up to 7.5°C during this period. The region of Lake JR01 cooled over the mid- to late Holocene, with high biological production between 6.1 and 5.4 ka. Biological production decreased again at ~ 2 ka and the rate of cooling increased in the past 2 ka, with coolest temperatures occurring between 0.46 and 0.36 ka [460 and 360 years ago], coinciding with the Little Ice Age.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWay back in February, Global Weather Oscillations (GWO) veteran meteorologist David Dilley predicted that the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season would be “the most dangerous and costliest in 12 years for the United States.”
Photo: David Dilley, GWO
In the wake of Harvey, and with an eye on the now growing threat posed by Irma, that prediction is emerging to be spot on.

Irma takes aim. Chart source (1 Sept 2017 9:00 CET): earth.nullschool.net/.
Dilley, a 40-year veteran and a former NOAA meteorologist, said the season would be influenced by a Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle – which is characterized by the lack of El Niño or La Niña conditions. Recently the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been hovering near neutral territory.
Ideal oceanic conditions
Dilley based his February prediction on natural cyclic factors, namely on the fact that ocean water temperatures would “continue to run warmer than normal across most of the Atlantic Basin and especially in the Caribbean region and the Atlantic near the United States” this year, which would “make conditions conducive for tropical storms and/or hurricanes forming and/or strengthening close to the United States“.
So far that too has been spot on as well. This scenario has also been supported by Joe Bastardi of Weatherbell Analytics. Bastardi, also a 40-year veteran meteorologist, points to similarities with hurricane patterns of the mid 20th century.
120-year trend clearly downward
Hurricane activity as a whole has been on a downward decline over the past 120 years, according to the NOAA – something that often gets no mention in the media.

Dilley also predicted that the Bermuda-Azores High Pressure Center would be weaker this summer, and thus would allow “more named storms to maintain strength – or strengthen as they move from east to west across the Atlantic toward the United States” – a pattern that Irma is following to a tee.
In his February forecast he wrote that the United States would have the potential for 6 named storms making landfall, the most most since 2005.

“Global warming has no influence”
In an e-mail response to NoTricksZone on whether hurricane Harvey’s intensity was related to global warming,  Dilley wrote:
Global warming has no influence – we have had major impact hurricanes in the past when it was cooler – it is all cyclical.
Dilley also said that Harvey will with very high likelihood not be the last to strike the USA, saying that a number of hurricane zones need to prepare for the worst this season.
Perfect conditions for Irma
Concerning Irma the 40-year veteran meteorologist says that the hurricane “is in an area having perfect conditions” and that he expects “4 major hurricanes in 2017 due to a stronger hurricane cycle year that occurs in conjunction with warm Atlantic Ocean water following a period that did not have a La Niña – less wind shear and good positioning of the Bermuda high“.
Texas hurricane hiatus is over
Dilley had predicted that Texas had a “good shot at coming out of their quiet hurricane cycle” as -there have been 7 quiet periods for Texas during the past 130 years, writing that “the typical quiet period lasts 8 to 10 years and 2017 was year 9 since their last hurricane”.
Florida and New England are due as well
He warns that “other prediction zones such as the peninsula of Florida and New England are likewise on the verge of breaking out of their quiet periods” and that they are “all cyclical based on electromagnetism of the earth-moon-sun gravitational cycles influencing the Bermuda high, ocean temperatures via an El Niño or no El Niño and individual hurricane landfall cycles for each zone.” He sums up:
Bottom line – Irma will be a major United States impact hurricane and not the last land-falling hurricane of the season.”
2018 will be a quieter season?
One bright note: Dilley believes that the 2018 season will be less harsh, in part because of more favorable natural ocean cycle effects in the Pacific and Atlantic.
For Dilley, hurricanes are part of the natural weather and climate cycles and that it is something we’ll have to relearn getting used to. In the early 20th century things were much worse than what we’ve grown accustomed to seeing over the past decade.

"About 40% of all forests across the US are at risk of being ravaged by an army of harmful pests, undermining a crucial resource in addressing the climate crisis, new research has found. Tree-damaging pests have already destroyed swathes of US woodland, with the American chestnut virtually wiped out by a fungal disease and elms blighted by Dutch elm disease. About 450 overseas pests that damage or feed on trees have been introduced to US forests due to the growth in international trade and travel.  A PNAS-published study of the 15 most damaging non-native forest pests has found that they destroy so many trees that about 6m tons of carbon are expelled each year from the dying plants. This is the equivalent, researchers say, of adding an extra 4.6m cars to the roads every year in terms of the release of planet-warming gases. This situation is set to worsen, with the spread of pests due to threaten 40% of the US forest biomass. Such a scenario would “have a devastating impact on the forests”, said Songlin Fei, a forestry expert and report author at Purdue University. “It is turning forests from storers of carbon to a carbon source. The best way to control these pests it through inspections and quarantine – once they are in the system it’s hard to stop them. For many trees it’s too late.” The threats range from the wood borer to pathogens and organisms that feed on tree sap. Some diseases, such as one that has infected trees across Hawaii, are little understood by scientists. Together, these maladies pose a growing threat to US forests that are coming under increasing strain from rising temperatures and altered rainfall and wildfire patterns, particularly in the west of the country, due to global heating. There are an estimated 6bn dead trees standing in the US west, with more trees now dying due to disease, insects and wildfire than are being felled for wood products. The impact of pests is visible in urban settings, too. Ash trees in Chicago have been devastated by the emerald ash borer, with city authorities last year turning some of the dying trees into public artworks. Trees are considered an invaluable resource in slowing global heating, due to their ability to soak up and store planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions. A recent study found that planting more than a trillion trees around the world could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that humans have pumped into the atmosphere, potentially making it the biggest and cheapest way to tackle the climate crisis."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online daily Abendblatt here and media all over Germany report that the country will not pass its climate protection act, which was supposed to be voted on tomorrow, thus meaning the Germany will come to the Marrakesh world climate conference later this month without any plan for decarbonizing its society.
Last June German Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks put forth the Climate Protection Plan 2050 with the aim of starting the “climate-friendly transformation of society”. The plan called for reducing CO2 emissions 40% by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels) and 80 – 95% by 2050.
However the plan was quickly and “radically” gutted out by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Office, Economics Minister/Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, Transportation Minister Alexander Dolbridt and Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt. The plan’s rejection sent a loud signal that the country was deeply divided on the issue, and that there were in fact other priorities far outweighing “climate protection”.
Plan withdrawn from a vote
The Ministry of Environment’s Climate Protection Plan 2050 was designed to systematically decarbonize German energy production, industry, transportation and agriculture by 2050, and was scheduled to be ratified by the German Bundeskabinett tomorrow, just in time for the world climate conference in Morocco, which starts next week.
However Minister Hendricks announced that she was withdrawing the latest plan, and thus it will not go up for a vote tomorrow. The reason, according to Klimaretter here: “It’s not ready for ratification.”

The move to allow the plan to fall apart sent a wave of surprise across the country as it signals that Germany will come to Morocco with no official commitment to substantially reduce CO2 emissions. Hendricks will attempt a new vote in December, long after the end of the Morocco conference.
“Unscientific hodgepodge of measures”
This is a devastating signal coming from a country often viewed as one of the leading proponents of CO2 reduction and climate protection. Initially Germany wanted to showcase it’s commitment to CO2 reductions, and so in Morocco serve as an example for responsible behavior to the rest of the world. Now Europe’s most powerful economy will have nothing to show, and Europe’s leadership on the issue appears seriously compromised.
According to the Abendblatt, Michael Fuchs of Merkel’s CDU party called Hendricks’s draft plan “an unscientific hodgepodge of measures” and that climate strategy has to be foremost focused on innovation and technology.
“Embarrassment”
Leading environmental groups and environmental activists blasted the government’s gutting out and opposition to the climate protection plan, calling it an “embarrassment” that Germany will show up in Morocco with no official intention of cutting back its emissions.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAnalyses show that global temperatures continue their rapid cooling trend, as Schneefan here writes. What follows are excerpts of his recent comprehensive analysis.
The cooling comes naturally in the wake of the moderate La Nina conditions that have ruled over the past months.
In April surface temperatures 2 meters above the ground plummeted as the following NCEP chart shows:

Global RSS satellite data show a rapid cooling since early 2016:

Moreover despite the powerful warming El Niño event of 2015/16, the unfalsified satellite data in 2016 show that no new significant global heat record was seen when compared to the El Niño year of 1998. We are talking about hundredths of a degree, completely within the boundaries of uncertainty.
No significant warming in 20 years

The powerful linear global cooling continued in April 2017 and will continue for the time being, Schneefan writes.
What does that mean for the global warming? Schneefan adds:
The IPCC global warming claimed by the climate models has been missing for almost 20 years. And that despite the constantly rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations!”
And just days ago, Kenneth Richards here showed that there hasn’t been any warming over the entire southern hemisphere at all. The warming of the past decades is not even global.
What is now becoming glaringly obvious is that the IPCC has wildly overestimated its projected global warming for the future. When the IPCC models from the various IPCC reports are compared to the observations, the result gets vividly illustrated by the following chart showing the satellite observed temperatures from January 2001 to June 2016:

The Global Warming Speedometer for January 2001 to June 2016 shows observed warming on the HadCRUT4 and NCEI surface temperature datasets as below IPCC’s least prediction in 1990 and somewhat on the low side of its 1995 and 2001 predictions, while the satellite datasets show less warming than all IPCC predictions from 1990 to 2001. Later IPCC predictions are too recent to be reliably testable. Source : Is the Reuters “news” agency committing fraud?
Massive Arctic ice thickness growth
The growth in so-called multiyear Arctic sea ice has been considerable over the past nine years. The Chukchi Sea and the East Siberian Sea had little thick multiyear ice back in February 2008. But by February 2017 there was a lot. Massive Growth In Thick Arctic Sea Ice:

If the Arctic is the climate canary in the coal mine, as many alarmists used to like claiming, then we probably ought to start worrying about cooling.

No Significant Modern Warmth

Public domain photo. Source here
In a late February (2017) interview on a U.S. news program, mechanical engineer Bill Nye claimed that the settled science says humans have been warming the planet at a rate that is  unnaturally and “catastrophically” fast since the year 1750 .
“It’s a settled question. The speed that climate change is happening is caused by humans.  Instead of climate change happening on timescales of millions of years or 15,000 years, it’s happening on the timescale of decades, and now years. …  Humans are causing it [climate change] to happen catastrophically fast.   [Without human activity], the climate would be like it was in 1750.”
When pressed to identify the signature change affirming this rapid human-caused acceleration, Nye immediately cited viticulture evidence, or grape-growing practices in England and France.
“Britain would not be very well suited to growing grapes as it is today [if not for human activity].  French winemakers would not be buying land to the north, as they are now [if not for human activity].”
Apparently Bill Nye believes it is quite unusual to grow grapes in England. Or maybe he believes that this has never happened before given his perceptions of the unprecedentedly fast pace of climate change since 1750. Perhaps he doesn’t realize that grape vineyards have been growing in England for thousands of years, or that grape harvesting occurred 100s of kilometers further north than it does today as recently as during the latter stages of the Medieval Warm Period (~1100 to 1300 A.D).
Considering how very sensitive grapes are to climate conditions, and that grapes can only be harvested successfully after ripening in climates that average a specified number of warm days per year, the use of grape harvest dating as a proxy for temperature has long been thought to be both promising and reliable.
Unfortunately for Bill Nye and those who believe modern warmth is exceptional, or that the climate has changed at a catastrophically fast pace since 1750, scientists who use grape harvest dates to reconstruct historical temperatures have not found that modern warmth is either unusual or unprecedented.  In fact, grape harvest date evidence suggests the opposite conclusion reached by Bill Nye is more accurate: there is nothing unusual about the modern climate and its “well-suitedness” to grape harvesting.  In fact, there were several periods of greater warmth than today (and thus better suitability for grape harvesting) during the multi-centennial (~1400-1900 A.D.) Little Ice Age — which had the coldest temperatures of the last 10,000 years.
In other words, there is nothing unusual, unprecedented, or remarkable — let alone “catastrophically fast” — about either the pace or degree of warmth in the modern climate.

Grape Harvesting 500 Kilometers North Of Present From 1100 – 1300 A.D.

Easterbrook, 2011
“The Medieval Warm Period (MWP) was a time of warm climate from about 900 A.D. to 1300 A.D. when global temperatures were apparently somewhat warmer than at present. Its effects were evident in Europe where grain crops flourished, alpine tree lines rose, many new cities arose, and the population more than doubled. The Vikings took advantage of the climatic amelioration to colonize Greenland, and wine grapes were grown as far north as England where growing grapes is now not feasible and about 500 km north of present vineyards in France and Germany. Grapes are presently grown in Germany up to elevations of about 560 m, but from about 1100 A.D. to 1300 A.D., vineyards extended up to 780 m, implying temperatures warmer by about 1.0-1.4°C (Oliver, 1973). Wheat and oats were grown around Trondheim, Norway, suggesting climates about 1°C warmer than present (Fagan, 2000).”

Grape Harvest Dating From 1300s -1500s A.D. Suggest Temperatures Were 1-2°C Warmer Than 20th Century

Pfister, 1988
“In 1420 wine harvest in Western and Central Europe began at the end of August, even on altitudes of 500 to 700 m (Bern, Toggenburg). This is the earliest date ever recorded. …  In 1420 the warm phase started in February. In March summer began already. The vine bloom was two weeks earlier than in 1893- the most advanced year within the instrumental period.”
“The comparison of the phenophases in 1420 and 1540 with the corresponding extremes documented with thermometrical evidence suggests that in 1420 all months from February to August (in 1540 from April to August) may have been 2 to 3 degrees above the 1901-60 average.  … [I]n 1270 and 1304 the early burgundy grapes were ripe at about the same time as in 1540, whereas in 1331 the ripening of the first cherries in Western France and the beginning of the wine harvest in Paris coincided roughly with the corresponding phenophases in 1420.”

“In 1420 the first ‘new wine’ from these grapes was drunk at the beginning of August, in 1540 on August 15, about twenty days before the wine harvest was opened. If this delay was the same in ordinary years, the mean grape harvest date would be around September 1st in the High Middle Ages, which is a few days earlier than in the warmest summers documented with thermometric measurement. From a regression approach comparing the decennial means of wine harvest dates and temperatures from 1370 to 1850 it has been estimated that an opening of the harvest on September 1st corresponds to a mean temperature from April to September that is 1.7 (+ -0.2) degrees above the average for 1901-60.”
“In the four years 1774, 1777, 1779, 1781, the only ones documented by thermometrical measurement, temperatures in August and September were 2.0 degrees above the 1901-60 average. From 1269 to 1339 positive anomalies [like these] occurred more than once every decade on average; this suggests that they were part of the “normal” climatic pattern; after 1340 their frequency drops to a level of 5%, after 1400 they became very rare. Not a single occurrence is measured for the seventeenth century. Since 1781 they have not been recorded any more. Undoubtedly the early fourteenth century marks a climatic watershed. The frequent occurrence of high maximum densities before 1330 can be interpreted in the context of a warm climate to which an advance in the beginning of the grape harvest is connected. It may be hypothesized that summers which were outstanding according to the standards of later periods, such as those of 1420, 1473 or 1540 were within the normal range of fluctuations during the High Middle Ages.”

Grape Harvest Dating Only Mildly Different Now Than During The 1600s – 1800s

Chuine et al., 2004
“Figure 1 [below] shows two early warm decadal fluctuations: one in the 1380s (0.72 °C) and one in the 1420s (0.57 °C), both above the 95th percentile. The warm period of the 1420s was followed by a cold period that lasted from the mid-1430s to the end of the 1450s (0.45 °C, under the 10th percentile). Our series also reveals particularly warm events, above the 90th percentile, in the 1520s and between the 1630s and the 1680s. These decades were as warm as the end of the twentieth century. The high-temperature event of 1680 was followed by a cooling, which culminated in the 1750s (under the 5th percentile) — the start of a long cool period that lasted until the 1970s.”

20th/21st Century Grape Harvest Dates Have Not Undergone Significant Change

Moreno et al., 2016 
“This paper reports a climatic reconstruction approach for the Minho region (NW of Portugal) using grape harvest dates (GHD) as proxy of surface air temperature. … The major external forcing of the climate system derives from the Sun. A solar signature has been found in global mean surface temperatures, with evidence directly related to two noticeably different features of the Sun’s dynamics: its short-term irradiance fluctuations and secular patterns of 22-year and 11-year cycles (Scafetta and West, 2008). … [I]t is recognized that solar forcing manifestations denote a strong spatial and seasonal variability (Usoskin et al., 2006), and this would be the reason why it might be illusive to seek a single global relationship between climate and solar activity (de Jager, 2005). Thus, Le Mouël et al. (2009) stated that a regional approach may allow one to identify specific forms of solar forcing, where and when the solar input is most important. … [S]olar footprints on terrestrial temperatures [are] due to the strong non-linear hydrodynamic interactions across the Earth’s surface, and the accepted longer-term solar activity influence creating temperature oscillations for tens or even hundreds of years (Scafetta and West, 2003, 2007, 2008). … These spectral analysis results appear to support a solar forcing with regards to Minho GHD [grape harvest dates].”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe mean temperature for Germany in August, 2016, was 17.7°C, which turns out to be 0.2°K colder than the figure reported in the overheated August 30, 2016 press release issued by the German DWD national weather service.
The August result makes the month 0.7°C warmer than the 1981-2010 mean. Nothing extraordinary.
However, the DWD has had a habit of overstating monthly mean temperatures in its press releases to the media.
German climate and weather blogsite wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here reports that this has been the fifth false monthly report by the DWD so far this year – suggesting that the DWD is indulging in climate warming propaganda.
What follows is a chart of August mean temperatures in Germany since 1881:

Source: DWD- data series and trends. Overall trend since 1990 is flat.
The DWD August press release shouted that “August 2016 was too warm!”
Overall the summer of 2016 (June, July, August) posted a preliminary mean of 17.8°C, which makes it 0.6°C colder than last summer.
The wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de site scoffs at the DWD claim that August “was too warm!”, reminding readers that snow fell down to elevations of 2000 meters in all three summer months, with record lows being set at a number of locations. The German site writes:
The 0.7°K deviation for the summer of 2016 in Germany is well within the normal range for mean summer temperature over the years – the summer was neither too cold nor too warm. It was quite normal. The DWD press release is false.”
The site points out that there was in fact only one single heat wave this summer, with maximum temperatures reaching above 30°C at least five days in a row or more, and it took place at the very end of August – and only in parts of Germany.
The big cities of Hamburg, Berlin, and Munich did not see a single heat wave in the summer of 2016, as the following charts illustrate:

The wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de site suggests that the DWD is exaggerating to make it look like Germany had a hot summer when in fact it was nothing of the sort. The site writes: the DWD August 30th press release tried to produce the impression of multiple widespread heat waves in Germany this summer, when in fact this was not the case at al.
Moreover an NOAA reanalysis of Europe up to August 28 shows that the greater part of the European continent had a much cooler than normal August 2016:

Source: www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/composites/day/
Over the past months global temperatures have cooled, Germany is much cooler than it was 1 year ago, and the area of thick Arctic ice has tripled in size over the past four years. Yet, that doesn’t keep the DWD from announcing a summer that was “too warm” with a deviation of only +0.7°C.

"A catastrophic combination of heat, drought, storms, forest fires, beetle plagues and a fungi blight have so far this year destroyed swathes of German forest equivalent to more than 200,000 football fields. Forests are one of the most efficient ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and in Germany alone they are able to absorb 62 million tonnes of CO2 – about 7% of the country’s emissions – every year.  But forests have also been at the heart of Germany’s cultural identity for centuries, and politicians are now seizing the issue – known as waldsterben (dying forest) – as a top priority. The agriculture minister, Julia Klöckner, has announced a forest summit next month, at which national forestry and climate experts are to agree on a multimillion-euro action plan. Klöckner has pledged €500m (£460m), to be paid out of the government’s energy and climate fund, to finance it. “Our forests are massively damaged,” Klöckner said, visiting Moritzburg near Dresden, which has been badly hit, many of its trees brown and dying, mainly due to drought and beetle infestations. “Only if everyone unites will we manage the mammoth task that lies ahead of us – to save our forests not only for ourselves but for future generations,” she said. The society for the protection of the German forest, SDW, believes the extent of the destruction goes even beyond the government’s estimate. It has said the trees being lost at the most rapid rate are those that make up the bulk of the forests, including spruces and firs, pines, beeches and oaks. In last year’s dry summer and this year’s, the forests have been hit by a shortfall of 200 litres of rainwater per square metre, according to SDW, which Germany’s meteorological service says is the driest it has been for 50 years. The association of German foresters (BDF) has said German forests are close to collapse. “The forest is the best way to save the climate, but right now the forest itself is a victim of the climate catastrophe,” it said. A third of Germany is made up of forest, or 11.4m hectares (28 macres) – about a half of which is private property. The crisis is being keenly felt, not least after a recent survey on national identity in which 50% of participants cited forests as being central to their idea of heimat or sense of home. Germans have for centuries had a mythological, even spiritual, identification with their forests. Woodlands have formed the inspiration for much German music and literature –most famously the 19th-century folk tales of the Brothers Grimm. In everything from Red Riding Hood to Hansel and Gretel the forest is portrayed as a place of foreboding and threat and as well as retreat, safety and learning. For German romanticists in the late 18th century, the forest was an important symbol of unity and purity, the word waldeinsamkeit, forest loneliness, embodying the sense of inner peace to be found in the forest. This was later exploited by the Nazis, who encouraged the idea of the forest as a sign of German cultural solidity, encouraging people to plant German oaks to honour Adolf Hitler. The tabloid Bild recently published an ode to the German forest, calling it “part of the German soul”. “It is, alas, not some made-up fairytale … that our forest is in a state of emergency … and if we don’t do something to save it and ourselves, we might end up with the story: ‘Once upon a time, there was a place called the German forest,’” the paper stated. Experts are divided over the best plan of action. Solutions range from introducing more robust tree species to naturally allowing forests to adapt to the conditions. The opposition Greens are calling for a return to primeval forests – woods left to their own devices, after researchers at Zurich’s Technical University calculated that there was room on the planet for a third more forests than at present without encroaching on urban or agricultural spaces. While owners of private forests are tending towards planting Douglas firs and northern red oaks, the Association for Environmental and Nature Protection in Germany, a leading NGO, says non-native species are an ecological risk. The trees that are most under threat are said to be spruce, beech, ash, Norway maple and sycamore. Those most able to weather the climate crisis are robinia, plane, and sweet and horse chestnut trees. Among those likely to be increasingly imported in future are Turkish hazel, Italian maple, silver lime, and Lebanon cedar. The challenge is to find species able to cope with hot summers as well as harsh winters. Klöckner believes that as many species as possible are necessary, referring to experts who say nature cannot be left to cope on its own. “We need mixed forests and trees that are adapted to their habitat,” she said. Tanja Sanders, an expert in forest ecology who researches what the forest of the future might look like, said: “Forests are a vital part of our lives. They form groundwater, give us wood, filter the air, reduce CO2 and the temperature and offer space for species conservation and human relaxation. But we must face up to having to say goodbye to the forest as we’ve known it.”"
"Climate change is making the drought in eastern Australia more severe and contributing to the woes of the Murray-Darling river system. However, only around one in 20 news stories about the drought mention climate change. An analysis of media coverage of the drought was prepared for Guardian Australia by Streem, a media monitoring company. The analysis looked at drought coverage from October 2017 onwards across TV, radio, online and print. Each news story was scored for the occurrence of key phrases [more detail about the methods below]. Overall, the media were more likely to mention financial relief or assistance funding (7.6%) in news stories than climate change (5.8%). Since Scott Morrison became prime minister, he was more likely to be mentioned in a news story (6.4%) than climate change. The mediums least likely to include climate change in news stories were radio (2.5%) and TV (2.6%), with commercial stations particularly low. Channel Nine mentioned climate change in only 0.7% of their news stories about drought, and Channel Seven in only 1.3%. The breakdown by publisher for online and print shows a split along broadsheet and tabloid lines, as well as by publisher, with Guardian Australia and Nine’s newspaper mastheads much higher than News Corp: Guardian Australia scored the highest, at 38%. While the effect of climate change on rainfall in Australia is complex, there are some regions where the trend is towards lower rainfall annually. According to a report put out by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, the southern part of the Murray-Darling Basin is getting less rain annually, and this change has been attributed to climate change. The influence of climate change on temperature is comparatively more straightforward. Since 1910, Australia has warmed by 1 degree on average. According to Andrew King, a climate scientist at the University of Melbourne, climate change is making droughts worse. “In general, climate change is exacerbating drought, mainly because in a warmer world we experience more evaporation from the surface, and we project for that to continue in the future,” he says. “So when it does rain, more of that water is likely to be lost to the atmosphere through evaporation than before human-caused climate change.”  This increased evaporation makes droughts more severe, as it reduces soil moisture available to plants, and also reduces the flow of water into river systems that people rely on for irrigation and drinking water, as well as reducing the water available for river and wetland ecosystems. David Holmes is the director of the climate change communication research hub at Monash University, and has conducted similar studies of media coverage. Holmes says that coverage of extreme weather trends tends to get overtaken by several common narratives that push climate change out of the story. “The first is the ‘triumph over tragedy’ narrative, which is all about how people are doing it tough, but they’re a resilient bunch and work out ways to overcome adversity,” he says. “The second most dominant narrative is the ‘unstoppable power of nature’, so we’re at the mercy of natural forces. With drought, it’s tied to a narrative where there’s always been a changing climate and droughts, so let’s not try and make it some unique thing, let’s just work out how to adapt.” Holmes says these and other narratives often shift climate change out of the analysis and can naturalise or bury the amplifying effects of climate change in extreme weather events. As to whether the media should be making the link between extreme weather events and climate change more frequently, Holmes suggests that people should be informed by the science where possible. “Find the experts that deal with drought and allow the scientists to make the link,” he suggests. “The best time to talk about [climate change] is during extreme weather events because people want to know what is going on.” Analysis of media coverage combined the following search term “Drought AND (Australia OR Australian OR “New South Wales” OR Victoria OR Queensland OR Tasmania OR “South Australia” OR “Northern Territory” OR “Western Australia” OR NT OR SA OR WA OR NSW OR ACT)“ with other phrases: “climate change”, emissions, “climate change” OR emissions, “rainfall patterns”, “drought relief” OR “financial assistance”, livestock OR cattle OR sheep, “Scott Morrison”, “Michael McCormack”. It is entirely possible that some stories will not be about the current drought, but instead will be using the term in a more general sense (eg man drought). Coverage is from October 2017 onwards."
"Australia has just experienced its third-hottest July on record, beaten only by records set in 2017 and 2018, as fire and water authorities in the eastern states prepare for a worse than average fire season. The year-to-date temperatures from January to July were the second warmest on record, according to a monthly statement from the Bureau of Meteorology. Rainfall recorded during that period is the fifth lowest on record, with the drought worst in New South Wales, southern Queensland, and eastern and central Victoria.  The mean maximum temperature in July was 2.23C above average – the third highest mean maximum temperature for July behind 2017 and 2018. The warm winter follows Australia’s hottest ever summer. Global temperatures for July were on track to make it the hottest month ever recorded, following the hottest June ever recorded. The fire service in New South Wales has announced a historic early start to the declared bushfire danger period in two local government areas along the far south coast, Eurobodalla and the Bega Valley. Ten more regions in the northeast and mid-north coast – Inverell, Tenterfield, Glen Innes Severn, Armidale, Uralla, Walcha, Nambucca, Kempsey, Port Macquarie Hastings, and the Mid-Coast region – were also declared to be in a bushfire danger period from 1 August. Bush fire season starts in 12 local government areas across NSW today due to continuing dry conditions. Don't be the fire risk to your community. Check if permits are required for your area at https://t.co/HK6egynjyv #nswrfs pic.twitter.com/YAiUCrZxWQ Rob Rogers, acting commissioner of the NSW rural fire service, said the fire season had been brought forward due to very dry and warm conditions across most of the state. About 98% of NSW is in a declared drought. “Last season we saw more fires in July and August than the whole of summer combined,” Rogers said in a statement. Fire authorities in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia are yet to declare the start of their fire danger periods, but both SA and Victoria are expected to do so earlier than normal. Historically, the fire season ran from November to March in the southern half of the country, and October to March in NSW. In recent years, the fire season, during which there are restrictions on burn-offs or lighting fires on private land, has been extended in all jurisdictions. The Murray Darling Basin Authority has also issued a grim outlook for the Murray Darling, warning that it expects to manage the river system for very dry conditions. Most dams are already very low and the authority does not expect to be able to draw any water from the Menindee Lakes in the coming year, which means the Lower Darling will depend totally on flows from upstream. The storages are now at 32% on average, but in the northern basin, dam levels average just 9%. Many towns in north-west NSW are already preparing to access alternative water sources, including sinking bores and installing desalination equipment, laying pipelines to bring water from other river systems, and even trucking in water. Inflows to the Murray Darling in the past 12 months were the eighth lowest in more than 100 years, the MDBA said. While the MDBA plans for all scenarios, it said the Bureau of Meteorology was forecasting very dry conditions for the next three months, when the river system usually receives rain. “Water in storages is lower than this time last year,” the MDBA. Most of the water is in Dartmouth Dam, on the Murray, to reduce evaporative losses. It is currently at 49%. One of the key risks is whether spikes in water demand will be able to be delivered though narrow parts of the Murray. There has been significant expansion of plantings of almonds and grapes around Mildura. “There is no indication at this stage that a shortfall will occur in the coming year, however, the risk remains real,” the MDBA says. “If conditions remain dry and state water use is as planned, there will be low storage levels at the end of this year,” the MDBA warns."
"Seventeen heatwaves already – and more to come. That’s what the Mallorca newspapers were reporting in early July, as holidaymakers endured day after day of punishing 35C-40C conditions. And they were right. Another unbearable heatwave arrived a fortnight later. The waitress in Palma was in despair. At least you can go back to an aircon hotel, she told me. Her home was a small shared apartment with no air conditioning. “When I get home, I lie on the bed, put ice over my body and hope I get some sleep before returning to work,” she added.  “We used to get maybe a few days like this in August every year. Now it starts so much earlier and lasts so much longer. I have no idea why you want to come here in this heat.” Ten million tourists visit Mallorca every year, with Brits jostling with the Germans as the biggest contingent. Airlines massively inflate their fares in July and August; hotels jack up their room rates; even the tabac in central Palma felt it could get away with charging €2.50 for a small plastic bottle of chilled water. What do we get for our money? Beaches now so insanely hot they are effectively off-limits until 5.30pm or later. Hotel bedrooms where you hide from the sun with the aircon on full blast, knowing you’re contributing to climate destruction, but feeling you’ll pass out otherwise. Even Palma’s wondrous cathedral loses its charm when you’re faced with an entrance queue snaking out into the scorching midday sun, largely made up of refugees from the monstrous cruise ships in the bay. The Boeing 707, Lunn Poly and Judith Chalmers of Wish You Were Here gave us the cheap Spanish package holiday in the 1970s, and British families have been heading there ever since. Sun and cheap food and drink in Mallorca, or a washout week in Margate for about the same money? It was hardly a tough choice. Then, more recently, we’ve seen the huge expansion in weekend break tourism, encouraged by budget airlines and Airbnb. But the climate crisis changes all that. A report last month attempted to visualise its impact on various cities around the world by 2050. Both Madrid and Athens will be more like present-day Fez in Morocco, the already high temperature in summer moving up by as much as another 6.4C. I’m no stranger to the Spanish summer heat, having lived for a year in Madrid. “Seis meses invierno, seis meses infierno” is how Spanish friends described their capital’s climate. The alliteration doesn’t work in English, but it translates to “six months of winter, six months of hell”. But that was the 1980s; that “infierno” is going to be full-on Dante within a few years. Margate is beginning to look rather more attractive. Spain, apart from the booze, is no longer the super-cheap destination it once was. The pound has fallen steeply, and may become permanently depressed post-Brexit. Holidays to Spain could turn into a financial disaster, with families paying a small fortune just to sit inside their hotels to escape intolerable conditions outside. Once is bad luck. But after your second or third holiday in unbearable heat, you won’t go again. Parts of Palma have already sunk into decay, with many of the 1970s high-rises built during the package holiday boom now tawdry and dated. Will the British seaside resorts, that were so decimated by Spanish competition, revive over the next few decades? A hotel in Bournemouth could be a much better investment than a development in Benalmádena. The report, that said Madrid will be engulfed by horrifically high temperatures, suggested London’s climate will, by 2050, become like Barcelona’s today. It was unfortunately worded, given how many commenters of the Daily Mail’s report seemed to think that “if this is climate change, great, bring it on”. If the climate changes that rapidly, then it’s not clear if much of London will be above water. There is much discussion among environmentalists about how we reduce the climate impact of flights, either by rationing or by price. Maybe neither will be necessary – we won’t go, because it’s just too damn hot. p.collinson@theguardian.com"

A new German paper assesses wind energy in Europe . The results are devastating. It concludes that wind energy requires almost 100% backup and that the more capacity that gets installed, the greater the volatility.
The paper appearing at the VGB, authored by Thomas Linnemann and Guido Vallana, finds that “the total wind fleet output of 18 European countries extending over several thousand kilometers in north-south and east-west direction is highly volatile and exhibits a strong intermittent character.”
In other words the power supply across the European grid fluctuates wildly and thus cannot work well. The paper’s abstract continues:
An intuitively expectable smoothing of this wind fleet output to an amount, which allows a reduction of backup wind power capacity, however, does not occur. In contract a highly intermittent wind fleet power output showing significant peaks and minima is observed not only for a single country, but also for the whole of the 18 European countries. Wind energy therefore requires practically 100% back-up. As the (also combined) capacities of all known storage technologies are (and increasingly will be) insignificant compared to the required demand, backup must be provided by conventional power plants, with their business cases fundamentally being impaired in the absence of capacity markets.”
Extreme volatility
The paper then provides a solid analysis, and charts showing why this is the case. Below their Figure 1 illustrates the extreme volatility of onshore and offshore German wind energy over the year 2016:

Germany’s wind energy output ranges from over 30,000 MW to almost zero. Source: ENTSO
Germany’s wind parks have produced only a fraction of their rated installed capacity, rarely ever reaching 20% annually with an average of 17% since 1990:

The paper concludes:
The available (secured) permanent electrical output of the German wind parks thus remains always below 1% of the installed rated capacity, or expressed in other words: Every year there was at least a quarter hour in which 99% of the rated capacity of the German wind parks was not available and where practically 100% of plannable backup energy dominated.”
Moreover an anylsis of weak wind phases over the 2010 to 2016 period shows that “there were at least 160 phases 5 days long or more where the output from German wind parks fell below 5000 megawatts and a 10-14 day phase of weak wind days occurred every year.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman physicists: “CO2 plays only minor role for global climate”
In a just published study in The Open Atmospheric Science Journal here, German scientists Horst-Joachim Lüdecke and Carl-Otto Weiss have used a large number of temperature proxies worldwide to construct a global temperature mean over the last 2000 years, dubbed G7, in order to find out more about the sun’s role on climate change.
Their results drop a huge surprise on the laps of scientists who have long believed the earth is warming due to human-emitted CO2.
The analysis by the German scientists shows the strongest climate cycle components as 1000, 460, and 190-year periods. The G7 global temperature extrema coincide with the Roman, Medieval, and present optima, as well as the well-known minimum of AD 1450 during the Little Ice Age.
Correlation 0.84
Using further complex analyses, they constructed a representation of G7, which shows a remarkable Pearson correlation of 0.84 with the 31-year running average of G7.
The authors used extensive local temperature proxy data [2 – 6] together with Britain’s Hadley CRU temperature records since 1870 and the recent satellite measurements, and combined them to make up the global temperature time series G7 for the last 2000 years.

In accordance to the definition of climate, the blue curve in the paper’s Fig. 3, shown above, depicts the climate history as the 30-year running average of the grey curve. Noteworthy, the historically known temperature extrema are well reproduced by the blue climate curve: The Roman Optimum (~0 AD), the Medieval Optimum (~1000 AD), the Present Optimum, as well as the Little Ice Age (~1500 AD),
Also the pronounced minimum of 1450 AD, when the vines in southern France were killed by cold. Also clearly shown by the climate curve is the warming from 1850 to 1995.
The detailed analysis of the local records show in general a multitude of peaks, the authors say, and the G7 however shows only 3 dominant peaks, which correspond to cycles known from local studies, of approx. 1000, 500, 200-year periods. The combination of local records to a global record apparently averages out local cycles and emphasizes global cycles.
The sum of these three dominant cycles (red curve in Fig. 3) reproduces the measured climate (blue curve in Fig. 3) with a remarkable correlation of 0.84.
In particular the sum of the three cycles shows the temperature increase from 1850 to 1995 as a result of the three natural cycles, the German researchers say, adding: “Thus one can conclude that CO2 plays only a minor role (if any) for the global climate.”
Lüdecke and Weiss note that the present maximum of the cycle sum corresponds well with the world temperature stagnation since 1995 AD, the stagnation unexplained by current climate models. As the dominant cycles have persisted for an extended time, one can assume that they will persist for the near future. They write: “This allows to predict cooling until 2070 AD.”

Disassemble Greenhouse Theory

Eight years ago, 2 physicists published a comprehensive 115-page scientific paper entitled “Falsification Of The Atmospheric CO2 Greenhouse Effects Within The Frame Of Physics” in the International Journal of Modern Physics.
Gerlich and Tscheuschner, 2009


Buttressed by a reference list of over 200 scientific publications, the authors addressed the merits of commonly held greenhouse “conjectures” as they relate to the laws of physics.
“By showing that (a) there are no common physical laws between the warming phenomenon in glass houses and the fictitious atmospheric greenhouse effects, (b) there are no calculations to determine an average surface temperature of a planet, (c) the frequently mentioned difference of 33°C is a meaningless number calculated wrongly, (d) the formulas of cavity radiation are used inappropriately, (e) the assumption of a radiative balance is unphysical, (f) thermal conductivity and friction must not be set to zero, the atmospheric greenhouse conjecture is falsified.”
From pages 35 to 44, Gerlich and Tscheuschner critiqued 14 different “fictitious” manifestations of the greenhouse effect theory as they have appeared over the course of the last several decades.


In a newly-published scientific paper, meteorologist and physical chemist Dr. Martin Hertzberg (and two other chemists) provide a condensed update to the Gerlich and Tscheuschner appraisal of the theoretical greenhouse effect.
Hertzberg  and colleagues also apply the standard laws of physics to critique 6 current theoretical explanations for the role of greenhouse gases (CO2) in presumably keeping the Earth 15°C warmer than it would otherwise be.
Included below is an abridged, less-technical version of the paper in an ostensibly user-friendly format.
It should be noted that the conclusions may be controversial even for skeptics of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) alarm.  That’s because the vast majority of climate skeptics at least accept the basic tenets of the greenhouse effect theory.  Instead, the existing skepticism focuses on the climate’s sensitivity to CO2 forcing in particular (low vs. high), not on whether the greenhouse effect as conventionally expressed is “real” or meets the standards applied by the laws of physics.
It is widely assumed that that the common understanding of how greenhouse gases operate in the climate system (the atmosphere and oceans) is both real and supported by scientific observation and physical tests.  This paper, like Gerlich and Tscheuschner (2009), may challenge this assumption.

Role of greenhouse gases in climate change
Hertzberg et al., 2017
This study examines the various definitions of the greenhouse effect for compatibility with the laws of physics.

Definition 1
A greenhouse is a glass/plastic enclosure, warmed by sunlight, facilitating plant growth. Several definitions argue that the effect in the atmosphere is analogous to a greenhouse. It is stated that sunlight transmitted into an enclosure through transparent glass warms the interior of the enclosure, increasing the Infra Red (IR) radiation. As glass is partly opaque to IR radiation, it cannot freely pass outward through the glass and is thus retained within the enclosure. Several definitions infer the radiation is being ‘trapped’ and it is argued that atmospheric gases such as CO2 are analogous to the glass pane action of a greenhouse and this serves to ‘trap’ IR radiation within the atmosphere and obstruct radiative cooling.
The Critique
An early test of the ‘trapped’ radiation theory was conducted by R. W. Wood.  He constructed two enclosures, one covered with a glass plate and the other covered with an IR transmitting rock salt plate. When adjusted so that both were exposed to the same solar input radiation, they both reached the same temperature of 55°C with ‘scarcely a difference of one degree between the temperatures of the two enclosures’. His experiment clearly showed that it was the presence of the enclosure itself that enabled the warming. Therefore, it is the heat generated by absorbed sunlight that becomes ‘trapped’. In the absence of an enclosure, the warmed air near the ground would rise by buoyancy and be replaced by cooler air from the surroundings thus cooling it. This natural convective cooling process is restricted and suppressed by the enclosure. It is the same process that generates a cooling afternoon sea breeze on a beach with cooler air from the ocean replacing rising warmer air over land. To argue that an open gaseous atmosphere confines in the way that the top and sides of a greenhouse enclosure does is not valid. To the contrary, a gaseous atmosphere is conducive to the convective cooling that occurs in the absence of an enclosure. It could be argued that CO2 along with the other gaseous components of the atmosphere in fact helps to cool the Earth’s surface.

Definition 2
Another common theme among the various descriptions of the effect is that the ‘greenhouse gases’ serve as a ‘blanket’ keeping the earth warm.
The Critique
A simple experiment to test the validity of this argument is to appear naked outside on a cold evening and observe how long the blanket of ‘greenhouse gases’ in the atmosphere keeps you warm. Air warmed by body heat rises by buoyancy and is replaced by cooler air from the surroundings, causing rapid cooling down and shivering. An actual blanket is a flexible insulating enclosure that reduces the rate at which body heat is lost to the surroundings. Thus the atmosphere is more given to being an agent for cooling by way of natural convection.

Definition 3
A regular description of the ‘greenhouse gas’ heating mechanism is that referred to as ‘back radiation’. Atmospheric gases such as CO2, having a dipole moment, absorb some incoming solar radiation and some of the IR radiation the Earth’s surface radiates toward free space. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, ‘re-radiated energy in the IR portion of the spectrum is trapped within the atmosphere keeping the surface temperature warm’. This ‘trapping’ is assumed to occur as the surface radiates to the atmosphere and the atmosphere radiates back to the surface.
The Critique
The radiation emitted from the warmer surface absorbed by the colder atmosphere is readily detected by orbiting satellites. However, back radiation from the colder atmosphere to the warmer surface heating the surface further violates the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

There are two problems with that amount of down-welling radiation: the atmosphere is not a blackbody with unit emissivity and equally, is not radiating toward a receptive absorber. Yet it is depicted as radiating heat downwards to the warmer Earth’s surface in direct violation of the Second Law.
The flow of heat is always from the hotter surface to the colder surface as required by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Nowhere in the radiation field between the two surfaces is the flux of radiant energy equal to that which either surface would emit if they were facing a complete void. Thus, the simple use of the Stefan-Boltzmann term, δT4 to characterize the emission from a source of radiation in the manner that depends only on the temperature of the source without considering the temperature of the surroundings receiving the radiation, is a misapplication of the equation and the notion that a colder source can transfer radiant energy to a warmer object is a misapplication of the Stefan-Boltzmann equation and a violation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
It would therefore be clear that the application of the Stefan-Boltzmann term to simply characterize radiant energy being transferred from an object to its surroundings without reference to the conditions of the surroundings in radiative contact with that object is a misapplication of the equation.
It would be incorrect to talk in terms of radiation exchanging, since transfer occurs only from warmer to cooler matter, from higher energy level to lower energy level.

Definition 4
A proposed new definition of the greenhouse theory to overcome the objections raised against warming by back radiation argues that IR absorbing ‘greenhouse gases’ hinder radiative transport from the Earth’s surface upwards and aid to keep the surface warm and warmer than it would otherwise be in the absence of those gases.
The Critique
The definition ignores the fact that those gases themselves emit radiation to free space adding to radiation loss from the system.  Radiation loss to free space from the earth’s surface and its atmosphere is essentially the same with or without presence of absorbing gases for the following reasons: the cooling by radiation to free space is a one-step process; in the presence of an atmosphere, it is a two-step process with the same loss, with or without, the absorbing and emitting gaseous atmosphere. When talking about radiation, it is absorbed radiation or emitted radiation that is being considered.

Definition 5
In many of the various definitions, attempt is made to prove that ‘greenhouse gases’ in the atmosphere keep the Earth warm, warmer than it would otherwise be in the absence of an atmosphere as conveyed by the following [enviropedia.org] quote:
“This process (radiation trapping) makes the temperature rise in the atmosphere just as it does in the greenhouse. This is the Earth’s natural greenhouse effect and keeps the Earth 33°C warmer than it would (otherwise) be without an atmosphere, at an average of 15°C.”
The Critique
Logically that argues that if the Earth had no atmosphere, its average temperature would be -18°C rather than its current temperature of 15°C. Such a temperature is based on calculated ones, that is ‘otherwise’ ones. The calculations arise from several mistaken assumptions. The most obvious one diminishes the solar radiation input by 37% from the Earth’s cloud albedo while simultaneously taking no account of any lessening of the IR radiation emitted to free space by the same blocking clouds. Equally, all IR radiating entities on the surface are assumed to be blackbodies with unit emissivity. The calculation that yields the -18°C temperature is obviously mistaken. The question is considered and covered in detail in the ‘Cold Earth Fallacy’.
Further argument used to illustrate the greenhouse effect of CO2 is the atmosphere of Venus, which is almost entirely [965,000 ppm] CO2. Based upon its distance to the Sun relative to that of the Earth, and using the Earth’s average temperature, Venus surface temperature should be about 280°C. Yet the measured value is about 465°C. This difference is attributed to the strong greenhouse effect of its higher CO2 concentration. The difference is more correctly attributable to Venus’ high surface pressure and the adiabatic compression of the atmosphere adjacent to its surface. Venus’ surface temperature would be just as warm if its atmosphere consisted of any gas whose compressibility was the same as that of CO2. The temperatures in the Mohave Desert and the Dead Sea are higher than the temperatures of surrounding areas at sea level. That is not a greenhouse effect but is caused by adiabatic compression of the higher pressures at their elevations below sea level.

Definition 6
All atmospheric gases that are believed to be ‘greenhouse gases’ absorb IR radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface. Their absorption spectra are well known and it is relatively easy to calculate the radiation flux, those gases absorb from the Earth’s IR emission.
The Critique
The problem arises when those radiation fluxes are translated into a resultant temperature rise while ignoring the fact that atmospheric gas is being simultaneously cooled by radiating to the unlimited sink of free space.

Epilogue 
In one of science’s first ‘thought experiments’ Pierre Prevost (1751–1839) conjectured that a hot body absorbed less radiation from a cold body than the reverse, and that both would eventually reach the same temperature. Thus, the theory of radiant exchanges came into being, a view that predated the more thorough understanding of the Laws of Thermodynamics that came later. Yet it is noted that aspects of Prevost’s 200-year-old theory continue to be applied in regard to ‘net flow’ of heat – a concept that radiation flows both downhill and uphill. The latter flow is a violation of the Second Law, which informs us that a hot body can absorb no radiation from a cold body to make it warmer still.
Radiative greenhouse supporters have theorized a blackbody as an all-absorbing entity, capable of absorbing and retaining its own radiation to elevate its temperature and have used radiant exchanges in support of their arguments.
[S]o far no way has been found to be able to readily transpose or correlate experiments conducted in the contained, static, isothermal and isobaric conditions of a laboratory to the great vastness of earth’s atmosphere.

Conclusion 
The various stated definitions of the greenhouse effect have been subjected to the rigorous scrutiny and application of the fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamics. They were found to be unreal, and unless some new definition can be put forward that satisfies and complies with those laws, it can only be concluded that the concept of a ‘greenhouse gas’ or a ‘greenhouse effect’ has not been demonstrated and is thus without merit.

‘Emotional Propaganda’, ‘Mythological Constructs’
Too Much Reliance On Models, ‘Consensus’

A University of Wollongong (Australia) investigative journalism professor with a research interest in ecological science and exposing environmental fraud has just published a scathing indictment of the climate science journalism industry in the academic journal Asia Pacific Media Educator.
Pulling no punches, Dr. David Blackall lambastes the modern climate science journalism practice of relying more on theoretical models, “expert” predictions, and authoritative “consensus” than on empirical observation and real-world physical measurements in reporting stories on global warming.
Instead of evaluating alarming claims of impending climate catastrophe with reasonable skepticism and critical review, today’s journalists not only reflexively accept the planetary meltdown narratives they promulgate, they simultaneously conceal the growing body of scientific evidence that may ameliorate the scariness of the modern climate narrative.

Journalists Refuse To Report Non-Alarmist Scientific Evidence

(1) Multiple papers have been published within the last year (Turner et al., 2016, Oliva et al., 2017) indicating that the rapid warming trend observed during the late 20th century for the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) has now reversed, and the AP has been dramatically cooling (-0.47 °C per decade) and glaciers have stopped receding in the region since 1999.   This cooling trend has not been reported by mainstream media outlets.
(2) Earlier this year, a paper (Fettweis et al ., 2017, with a review available here) was published in The Cryosphere indicating that the Greenland Ice Sheet melt had (a) contributed just 1.5 cm (0.6 of an inch) to sea levels between 1900 and 2010; (b) there was no net ice sheet loss during the 60 years between 1940 and 2000 despite explosive growth in anthropogenic CO2 emissions during that period; and (c) net ice sheet losses were similar to today during the 1930s, when CO2 concentrations were about 100 ppm lower.  This long-term Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance in an era of “alarming” warmth has not been reported by mainstream media outlets.
(3) In the 2007 IPCC report, it was claimed that glaciers in the Himalayas were melting so rapidly that the “likelihood is very high” that they would “disappear” by the year 2035.   And yet many published scientific papers have shown (here, here, here, here, here, here, and here) that the Himalayan region has not only not been warming in recent decades, but 88% of the glaciers in the region are either stable or advancing, with a net change of just 0.2% since 2000 (Bahuguna et al., 2014, Bolch et al., 2016, Holzer et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2016).
(4) About a year ago, a NoTricksZone review of 8 recently published scientific papers revealed (a) land area across the world is expanding more rapidly than sea levels are rising; (b) climate change (warming) is not the primary determinant of sea level changes (coastal erosion and accretion, tectonic uplift and subsidence are more influential); (c) globally, sea levels are only rising by about 1 mm per year according to tide gauges; and (d) an anthropogenic signal could not be detected in regional sea level rise trends.  Of course, no mainstream media outlet publicized these scientific findings.  They don’t support the alarmist narrative.
(5) There were 133 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in 2016 linking solar forcing to climate changes.  There have already been 84 Sun-Climate papers published thus far in 2017.   More and more solar scientists are predicting a Grand Solar Minimum and concomitant global cooling in the coming decades.  Journalists have not been inclined to report on these developments in solar science.  The Sun-Climate link does not fit with narrative that humans are the predominant cause of climate changes.
(6) Finally, a collection of over 300 graphs of reconstructed historical (Holocene) temperatures has been made available in recent months. These graphs, taken from hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific papers, reveal that modern warming trends are neither unusual or unprecedented, and they do not even fall outside the range of natural (pre-anthropogenic influence) variability.   And yet what do mainstream journalists report in their headlines on a routine basis?   That today’s temperature changes are “shocking”, “stunning” and “unprecedented”.
Would it be so difficult for journalists to actually seek scientific verification of their claims before publishing?
Or is the pursuit of real-world scientific confirmation too much to expect from journalists and media sources bent on advancing an agenda in this “Post Truth World”?

Blackall, 2017


‘Forlorn’ Polar Bears An Example of  ‘Emotional Propaganda’, ‘Fake News’ Reporting

“One particularly emotive story line attached to this topic is the so-called pending extinction of the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) population. In recent times, there have been a number of claims that polar bears are threatened with extinction because global warming was melting their habitat. Yet the scientific evidence suggests to the contrary: population counts conducted between 2007 and 2017 suggest that bear numbers are on the increase. This has led Crockford (2017a) to label such claims as emotional propaganda. In the last decade, cherrypicked and unverified photographic material, ‘emotional’ videos, even animation, then used in news, of forlorn bears floating on ice was the practice (Crockford, 2016; Rode, 2014). This is a good example of ‘fake news’.”

Climate Models Not Confirmed, Harmonious Pre-Industrial Climate A ‘Mythical Construct’

“Scientific uncertainty arises from ‘simulations’ of climate because computer models are failing to match the actual climate. This means that computer models are unreliable in making predictions. Published in the eminent journal Nature (Ma, et. al., 2017), ‘Theory of chaotic orbital variations confirmed by Cretaceous geological evidence’, provides excellent stimulus material for student news writing. The paper discusses the severe wobbles in planetary orbits, and these affect climate. The wobbles are reflected in geological records and show that the theoretical climate models are not rigorously confirmed by these radioisotopically calibrated and anchored geological data sets. Yet popular discourse presents Earth as harmonious: temperatures, sea levels and orbital patterns all naturally balanced until global warming affects them, a mythical construct. Instead, the reality is natural variability, the interactions of which are yet to be measured or discovered (Berger, 2013).”

A Non-Warming Climate Doesn’t Fit The Narrative – So It’s Unreported, Manipulated

“Contrary to news media reports, some glaciers throughout the world (Norway [Chinn et al., 2005] and New Zealand [Purdie et al., 2008]) are growing, while others shrink (Paul et al., 2007). New Zealand’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research and Victoria University found that ‘regional cooling’ over 25 years had correlated with growing glaciers (Mackintosh et al., 2017).”
“Sea levels too have not been obeying the ‘grand transnational narrative’ of catastrophic global warming. Sea levels around Australia 2011–2012 were measured with the most significant drops in sea levels since measurements began. This phenomenon was due to rainfall over Central Australia, which filled vast inland lakes. It was not predicted in the models, nor was it reported in the news. The 2015–2016 El-Niño, a natural phenomenon, drove sea levels around Indonesia to low levels such that coral reefs were bleaching. The echo chamber of news repeatedly fails to report such phenomena and yet many studies continue to contradict mainstream news discourse.”


Scientific Uncertainty Replaced By ‘Consensus’ (Post-Normal) Science, Model ‘Validation’

“Scientists test, measure, observe and retest, and they must be able to verify and repeat results (Errington et al., 2014). Uncertainty is always present (van Der Sluijs, 2005), but when uncertainty is replaced by ‘consensus’ (post-normal science), a culture of gatekeeping ensues (Lindzen, 2009). Post-normal science is said to be appropriate when ‘traditional methodologies are ineffective. In those circumstances, the quality assurance of scientific inputs to the policy process requires an ‘extended peer community’, consisting of all those with a stake in the dialogue on the issue’ (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1993). Then, and dangerously, dissenters are silenced so that chosen and ‘necessary’ discourses arrive in journals, conferences and boardrooms. In such a climate, it is difficult for the assertion to be made that there might be other sources, than a nontoxic greenhouse gas called carbon dioxide (CO2), that could be responsible for ‘climate disruption’. A healthy scientific process would allow such a proposition.”
“Journalism conveys a ‘professional authority’—touting its discourse as ‘fact checked’, within ‘editorial consensus’—its validation process. However, ‘validation’ in climate science means something completely different—a model is validated, ‘acceptable for its intended use’, because it meets specified computer performance requirements (Rykiel, 1996).”

Correcting Climate Journalism’s ‘False Narratives’: Offer Public Alternative Perspectives

‘An online survey revealed similarity between climate change deniers and believers in terms of preference for climate change news sources and rating of reliability of authorities. It was also discovered that both groups do not believe in conspiracy theories. Thus the results show that participants on both sides in the discussion on climate change are similar, rational, and are basing their judgments by using similar types of sources.’ (Grabbe, 2015)
“As there is uncertainty with greenhouse gas theory, students should be given alternative perspectives to help find ways to publish stories that question, challenge and enlighten. With technological change in the traditional newsroom, which brings ‘heightened accountability’ (Bivens, 2008), and instantaneous research capability, there are plenty of opportunities to correct false narratives.”
An Alternative Perspective Example: Clouds As Climate Control Mechanism
“One avenue is to suggest the alternative narrative: clouds are crucial in climatic control, yet their role and production is not thoroughly understood. Clouds control terrestrial and ocean surface temperatures and this has been known for decades—in agronomy, geography and meteorology.  Could the great environmental catastrophe instead involve clouds and the water cycle?”

20+ New Papers Affirm The Failures Of Climate Modeling

Hedemann et al., 2017  (full paper)
“During the first decade of the twenty-first century, the Earth’s surface warmed more slowly than climate models simulated. This surface-warming hiatus is attributed by some studies to model errors in external forcing, while others point to heat rearrangements in the ocean caused by internal variability, the timing of which cannot be predicted by the models. The observed trend deviated by as much as −0.17 ◦C per decade from the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) ensemble-mean projection—a gap two to four times the observed trend. The hiatus therefore continues to challenge climate science.”

Power et al., 2017
“All of the model simulations examined simulate multi-decadal warming in the Pacific over the past half-century that exceeds observed values.”

Zhou and Wang, 2017
“Land surface air temperature (Ta) is one of the fundamental variables in weather and climatic observations, modeling, and applications. Despite the ongoing increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases, the global mean surface temperature (GMST) has remained rather steady and has even decreased in the central and eastern Pacific since 1998. This cooling trend is referred to as the global ‘warming hiatus’“

Xie et al., 2017
“As the recent global warming hiatus has attracted worldwide attention, we examined the robustness of the warming hiatus in China and the related dynamical mechanisms in this study. Based on the results confirmed by the multiple data and trend analysis methods, we found that the annual mean temperature in China had a cooling trend during the recent global warming hiatus period, which suggested a robust warming hiatus in China.”

Xian and Fu, 2017
“Despite continually increasing concentrations of greenhouse gas, there has been a hiatus in rising global temperatures during the 21st century.”

Liu and Zhou, 2017
“[C]limate models designed to represent the physics and dynamics of the climate system project that GMST [global mean surface temperature] continued to rise in the early 2000s. Dominant mechanisms proposed to understand the hiatus included the internal climate variability and ocean heat uptake and transport; however, the differences in the atmospheric footprint of recent warming slowdown remains unclear in terms of the dynamical and physical processes.”

Rosenblum and Eisenman, 2017
“Observations indicate that the Arctic sea ice cover is rapidly retreating while the Antarctic sea ice cover is steadily expanding. State-of-the-art climate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. … [T]he models are not consistent with the observations.”

Zanchettin, 2017
“[U]ncertainties and gaps of knowledge in the characterization of forced decadal climate responses remain large, and only a few studies have systematically tackled the implication of these forcing agents for decadal predictability and prediction. For all forcing agents, major limitations in understanding arise from incompleteness and shortness of the instrumental observations concerning the forcing as well as the climate response. Further issues concern the deficient representation of key processes in climate models and limitations inherent to reconstructed evidence.”

Kravtsov, 2017
“[S]tate-of-the-art global models used to predict climate fail to adequately reproduce such multidecadal climate variations. In particular, the models underestimate the magnitude of the observed variability and misrepresent its spatial pattern. Therefore, our ability to interpret the observed climate change using these models is limited.”

Zhang et al., 2017
“Climate models, including typical regional climate models, do not directly simulate all extreme rainfall producing processes, such as convection.”

Zuidema et al., 2017
“The ‘double ITCZ’ error is further implicated in the simulated Hadley circulation, seasonal cycle and winds on the equator, and equatorial modes of variability, such as El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Pacific, casting doubt on the ability to model and predict both regional and global climate. … OAFlux allows for more ocean warming than is observed, an error that implies the CMIP5 model net flux biases are even larger, by at least 10 W m−2 …  Mean CMIP5 net CRE biases are very large, up to 40 W m−2, relative to CERES values. … The CMIP5 models generally continue to underestimate subtropical stratocumulus cloud cover relative to observations“

Ahlström et al., 2017
“Our results suggest that climate biases could be responsible for a considerable fraction of the large uncertainties in ESM [Earth system models] simulations of land carbon fluxes and pools, amounting to about 40% of the range reported for ESMs. We conclude that climate bias-induced uncertainties must be decreased to make accurate coupled atmosphere-carbon cycle projections.”

Zhou et al., 2017
“The evaluation results show that 5 out of 30 climate models can well capture the observed APO [Asian-Pacific Oscillation]-related features in a comprehensive way, including the strengthened South Asian high (SAH), deepened North Pacific trough (NPT) and northward East Asian jet (EAJ) in the upper troposphere.” [25 of 30 climate models cannot capture the APO features comprehensively.]

Comiso et al., 2017
“The Antarctic sea ice extent has been slowly increasing contrary to expected trends due to global warming and results from coupled climate models. After a record high extent in 2012 the extent was even higher in 2014 when the magnitude exceeded 20 × 106 km2 for the first time during the satellite era. … [T]he trend in sea ice cover is strongly influenced by the trend in surface temperature [cooling]. …  [T]he ability of current climate models to forecast sea ice trend can be improved through better performance in reproducing observed surface temperatures in the Antarctic region.”

Stenni et al., 2017
“A recent effort to characterize Antarctic and sub-Antarctic climate variability during the last 200 years also concluded that most of the trends observed since satellite climate monitoring began in 1979 CE cannot yet be distinguished from natural (unforced) climate variability (Jones et al., 2016), and are of the opposite sign [cooling] to those produced by most forced climate model simulations over the same post-1979 CE interval. …  [L]ack of confidence in climate model skill for the Antarctic region (Flato et al., 2013). … [N]o continent-scale warming of Antarctic temperature is evident in the last century.”

Büntgen et al., 2017
“Little agreement is found with climate model simulations that consistently overestimate recent summer warming and underestimate pre-industrial temperature changes. … [W]hen it comes to disentangling natural variability from anthropogenically affected variability the vast majority of the instrumental record may be biased.”

Schroeter et al., 2017
“Antarctic sea ice extent has increased by approximately 1.5 % per decade since satellite observations began in 1979 (Parkinson and Cavalieri, 2012; Turner et al., 2015). [M]odels in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) exhibit decreasing sea ice trends in all months (Turner et al., 2013a). The reasons for the disparity between observed and modelled trends are not yet well understood (Bindoff et al., 2013; Hobbs et al., 2016).”

Stouffer et al., 2017
“There are a number of systematic model biases that appear in all phases of CMIP that remain a major climate modeling challenge. These biases need increased attention to better understand their origins and consequences through targeted experiments. Improving understanding of the mechanisms’ underlying internal climate variability for more skillful decadal climate predictions and long-term projections remains another challenge for CMIP6.”

Barcikowska et al., 2017
“How global temperature will evolve over the next decade or so remains unclear (Knutson et al. 2016), although the most recent warming hiatus, observed in surface temperature records over the period 1998–2014, has challenged the scientific community in terms of consistency of models versus observations and in the attribution of the phenomena (Kosaka and Xie 2013; England et al. 2014; McGregor et al. 2014; Fyfe et al. 2012).”

Hope et al., 2017
“Comparison of the observed rise in GMST [global mean surface temperature] over the past 32 years with GCM output reveals these models tend to warm too quickly, on average by about a factor of two. Most GCMs [general circulation models] likely represent climate feedback in a manner that amplifies the radiative forcing of climate due to greenhouse gases (GHGs) too strongly.”

Crockford, 2017
“Data collected between 2007 and 2015 reveal that polar bear numbers have not declined as predicted and no subpopulation has been extirpated. … [T]he hypothesis that repeated summer sea ice levels of below 5 mkm2 will cause significant population declines in polar bears is rejected. This result indicates that the ESA and IUCN judgments to list polar bears as threatened based on future risks of habitat loss were hasty generalizations that were scientifically unfounded, which suggests that similar predictions for Arctic seals and walrus may be likewise flawed, while the lack of a demonstrable ‘sea ice decline = population decline’ relationship for polar bears invalidates updated survival model outputs that predict catastrophic population declines should the Arctic become ice-free in summer.”

McKinley et al., 2017
“The current inability to accurately quantify the mean CO2 sink regionally or locally also suggests that present-day observational constraints are inadequate to support a detailed, quantitative, and mechanistic understanding of how the ocean carbon sink works and how it is responding to intensifying climate change. This lack of mechanistic understanding implies that our ability to model (Roy et al. 2011, Ciais et al. 2013, Frolicher et al. 2015, Randerson et al. ¨ 2015), and thus to project the future ocean carbon sink, including feedbacks caused by warming and other climate change, is seriously limited. … [I]t is not yet possible to directly confirm from surface observations that long-term growth in the oceanic sink is occurring. … [T]his CESM-LE analysis further illustrates that variability in CO2 flux is large and sufficient to prevent detection of anthropogenic trends in ocean carbon uptake on decadal timescales.”

"The boom in the US shale gas and oil may have ignited a significant global spike in methane emissions blamed for accelerating the pace of the climate crisis, according to research. Scientists at Cornell University have found the “chemical fingerprints” of the rising global methane levels point to shale oil and shale gas as the probable source.  Methane, levels of which have been increasing sharply since 2008, is a potent greenhouse gas that heats the atmosphere quicker than carbon dioxide. Researchers at Cornell said the carbon composition of atmospheric methane, or the “weight” of carbon within each methane molecule, was changing too. Robert Howarth, the author of the paper published in the journal Biogeosciences, said the proportion of methane with a “carbon signature” linked to traditional fossil fuels was falling relative to the rise of methane with a slightly different carbon make-up. Researchers had previously assumed the “non-traditional” methane was from biological sources such as cows and wetlands, but the latest research suggests unconventional oil and gas from fracking may be playing a significant part. The theory would support a correlation in the rise of methane in the atmosphere and the boom in fracking across the US over the last decade. “This recent increase in methane is massive,” Howarth said. “It’s globally significant. It’s contributed to some of the increase in global warming we’ve seen and shale gas is a major player.” However, UK academics have said the jury is still out because there remained “significant uncertainty” about the theory, which has not been conclusively proven.  The claim is “highly contentious in the academic community and further work is needed to constrain uncertainty before conclusions such as this can be robustly backed up”, said Prof Grant Allen, from the Centre for Atmospheric Science at the University of Manchester. “However, this paper makes a very important point,” he said. “Controlling emissions from fracking, and fossil fuels in general, represents a potential policy quick fix to stemming the rise of methane still further.” Howarth said his report showed that if humans stopped emitting large quantities of methane into the atmosphere, it would dissipate. “It goes away pretty quickly, compared to carbon dioxide. It’s the low-hanging fruit to slow global warming,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you happened to read or hear the German and international headlines from just over a week ago, you’d think the million-population port city of Hamburg, Germany, had been hit by a devastating tornado on June 22, leaving a path of destruction in its wake.
What follows is a great example of how the media will run with anything, without checking, as long as it fits their climate and extreme weather narrative. The German media over the years have been tending to hype up every weather anomaly — to get the message into people’s heads that climate change is real and is happening.
The following story is almost unbelievable. A local gust of wind toppling over a few trees somehow managed to morph within the media into a headline-making super-tornado that supposedly ripped through a large city. Fake news at its best.
On June 22 a cold front swept across Hamburg, Germany, accompanied by severe weather, so “severe” that hundreds of media outlets, domestic and foreign, reported it has headline news.
Skeptical, Spiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski decided to investigate to see what really happened, and subsequently reported here the result. It turns out it was 99% fake news. Bojanowski wrote:
Residents spoke of heavy damage, the media reported. However the body of evidence is thin. […] the search for evidence has proven to be difficult.”
It turns out that the “tornado” that supposedly hit Hamburg in broad daylight, a city of some 1 million residents, so far has found only one single (dubious) witness. Yet, it was all the media needed to unleash sensational headlines globally: “A tornado rips through the city of Hamburg“.
DWD sets off confusion
According to Bojanowski “the storm of confusion” over the “tornado” was started around lunch time by the German DWD national weather service, which tweeted: “Tornado over Hamburg! About 10 km SSW from the city center. Lasted about 5 min.”
This in turn was followed by the German DPA press agency (Germany’s version of the AP) releasing at 2:34 pm: “Tornado leaves devastation in its wake south of Hamburg.” Here the German DPA relied on a sole eyewitness report from firefighter Stefanie Engelke, who reported witnessing up close a powerful gust of wind uprooting some trees that toppled onto a building, causing damage to its roof.
Shortly thereafter, however, the Hamburg Fire Department disputed that a “tornado” had ever occurred, tweeting later it had “no knowledge over any tornado“. Yet the DPA stuck to its story, Bojanowski writes. And the DWD weather service also reiterated having witnessed a tornado.

Wind gust morphs into “devastating tornado”
But then veteran high-profile meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann tweeted his doubts about the “tornado eye-witness fire fighter” which the DPA relied on for its report of “devastation”. Kachelmann tweeted:
Clueless fireman, who saw no tornado but damage like you see on TV, yet suffices for a total fabrication @dpa. https://twitter.com/dpa/status/877910082452901888 …“
But it was already too late. By then that powerful wind gust, which had uprooted some trees, quickly managed to morph into a full fledge super tornado in the media, and got reported internationally. The World News Media here tweeted:
Tornado tears through #Hamburg following extreme heat wave https://on.rt.com/8fpu …”.
By Thursday evening, the DWD backed off its original “5-minute tornado” account, tweeting that it had witnessed the “tornado” near the middle of the city instead. Later at Facebook the DWD even released a photo of the “tornado” it had “seen”:

DWD tweet n English:
As reported earlier today, the DWD colleagues of the Aviation Advisory Center North at the Hamburg airport saw a very short-lived tornado about 10 km ssw of the airport at 11:37 a.m. It had ground contact less than 5 minutes  (visible by the rotating dust cloud beneath the funnel cloud). Magnitude estimated at F0, and indeed did not cause any damage.”
That hardly looks like a tornado in the photo. And so not surprisingly even that DWD account got disputed later by a witness. At Twitter Hamburg resident Kerrag posted a 1:55 minute video showing no ground contact at all!
That’s the story of how the Hamburg “tornado”, which was merely a gust of wind, wound up making international headlines as a “devastating” tornado that had flattened part of a major European city.

"Here’s the problem: in two months’ time I must travel to Malawi in southern Africa to help Gumbi Education, a small, Guardian-led kids’ education charity that I chair. There’s no Skype option, no railways or boats, and travelling 3,000 miles across Egypt, Sudan, Kenya and Tanzania by bus is not recommended. I’ve cut my annual holiday flights, I’ve reduced my work travel, and my carbon footprint is nothing to what it was. But realistically, I must fly the 10,200 miles to and from Lilongwe – and I want to offset my emissions in some way. If done correctly, this should mean that I do less harm overall. But what I thought would be easy to arrange has proved a minefield. There is no agreement on how much carbon dioxide a journey may emit, confusion about what actions best reduce emissions, a huge choice of where to direct your money, and growing cynicism as airlines, airports and giant carbon-greedy corporations use offsetting to sell more flights or get permission to grow even further. A decade ago, the voluntary carbon offset market was tiny, unsophisticated and largely unregulated. The little money raised was aimed at worthwhile projects, but few schemes to cut emissions or promote development were verified or certified. Exposés, the financial crash and painfully slow progress in the UN climate talks all helped discourage individuals and companies from offsetting. But as awareness of the climate crisis has grown, corporates in particular have turned to voluntary offsetting and sent the market mainstream. Small companies have been weeded out, highly regulated global carbon and renewable energy markets have been set up, and thousands of participating companies and charities are now theoretically held to international standards by independent verifiers. As the climate emergency grows, so too does the money involved – and the need for accountability. Offsetting means calculating emissions and then purchasing equivalent “credits” from projects that prevent or remove the emissions of an equivalent amount of greenhouse gases elsewhere. One tonne of carbon is usually the equivalent of one credit and the market for these credits, worth possibly a few tens of millions of dollars in 2007, is now valued at over $500m a year and growing fast. Even though the International Air Transport Association (IATA) says that just 1% of passengers offset their carbon emissions through voluntary programmes, there has been a 140-fold growth between 2008 and 2018, with 430 million tonnes of emission reductions generated since 2005. This is equivalent to more than all of Australia’s energy-related emissions in 2016, according to Forest Trends, a New York-based conservation finance company that tracks carbon offset projects. The company’s report, Voluntary Carbon Markets Insights, says: “Demand for voluntary carbon offsets has grown … from just 0.3 million tonnes of CO2 in 2008 to 42.8 million tonnes in 2018.” Sarah Leugers, communications director of the Geneva-based nonprofit Gold Standard, which was set up by environment group WWF, says that – paradoxically – Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris agreement transformed the market, with companies and individuals all now wanting to do the right thing in contrast. As the market matures, so the choice of ways to offset emissions increases. You can now offset rail, road and air journeys, your stay in a holiday hotel, your daily commute, your home heating – indeed you could offset the emissions of your whole life. You could have a forest of banana trees or avocados planted in Kenya, reduce the amount of methane emitted from an Indonesian waste dump, provide fresh water to Malawians, rewild Romania or reforest areas of the Amazon basin home to communities of indigenous peoples. Today, the big offset certifiers such as American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, Gold Standard, Plan Vivo and Verra offer many hundreds of projects. To make it even more complex, the carbon price of these projects depends on where they are and the benefits they offer. Standards of verification also vary but in general are considered to be much tighter in Europe than the US. Most voluntary offsetting organisations operate as nonprofits, but few of them will spell out the fact that they might take up to 20% of what users contribute as running costs. The problem is knowing what is best. Tree planting is theoretically highly effective but some offset schemes have attracted criticism for displacing people or creating monocultures; wind and solar power projects are usually widely welcomed on a community level; capturing methane gas from waste tips and landfill sites makes total sense but is hardly attractive; and energy efficiency works best with the profligate rich. All schemes have pluses and minuses. “Offsetting must go hand in hand with an ambitious internal reduction strategy,” says Leugers. “The first priority should always be to reduce your own footprint before offsetting, but the reality is that not every individual or business can do that quickly. “Business is putting in more money, but the number of people acting individually is growing significantly. We have 1,500 projects in the pipeline. We don’t choose them; NGOs come to us. They are all independently verified. The best advice I can give is to always look for the underlying standards.” Robert Stevens of Climate Care agrees: “Until we reach a zero-carbon world … paying to reduce an equivalent amount of carbon emissions through voluntary offsetting is the most cost-effective, quickest and efficient way of doing this.”  But even trying to establish how much you emit on a journey is hard. Some offsetters take into account the extra impact of flying at an altitude above 35,000 feet; others look at the age of the aircraft type you are likely to fly in, whether you travel business class, any stop-off points and how full the plane is likely to be. As the market grows, it throws up anomalies and prompts accusations that it legitimises the growth of emissions. Twenty-nine of the most fuel-profligate airlines, including Emirates, Delta, BA, Air Canada and Gulf, now offer to offset their customers’ flights, and 15 airlines now voluntarily offset their own emissions in some capacity. According to Airport Carbon Accreditation, 43 European airports (representing 26% of European air traffic) are now certified Level 3+ neutrality, with a further 232 around the world part of the same accreditation scheme, meaning they have at least begun their journey towards reducing emissions. This allows Heathrow – which hopes that with a third runway it will be able to take an extra 265,000 flights a year – to say that it plans to use offsets to make it “carbon neutral” by 2030 and to be “zero-carbon” by 2050, even though it will build one of the world’s largest car parks and directly increase global emissions by millions of tonnes of CO2. This is wholly disingenuous, says Green MP Caroline Lucas, who describes Heathrow as “taking economy with the truth to new levels”. But there’s no doubt that companies, individuals, nonprofit groups, even cities are now using offsets to go “carbon-neutral” or even “zero carbon”. Liverpool is working with Malta-based blockchain nonprofit Poseidon to offset emissions with projects in Africa; and brands such as Disney, Microsoft, Lyft, Apple, Aviva and Sony have pledged to use offsets to become climate neutral. The bottom line is that to offset emissions, it is now possible to pay almost what you want to whom you want (though it is surprisingly difficult to calculate cruise ship emissions). The key to gauging the large-scale projects favoured by companies is to ascertain that they are real, measurable, independently verified and permanent, and would not have taken place without the finance provided by the sale of credits. Ideally, say observers, travellers should check to see whether they offer verified emission reduction (VER) credits, as offered by Gold Standard. The other approach is to use DIY offsets. This involves working out your emissions using an online calculator (see calculator tool above), then finding a project that roughly compensates (for example Gold Standard). Or you could just donate to an organisation working to suck up carbon or generate renewable energy. Many admirable environmental projects run by small energy and conservation groups do excellent work on tree planting and clean energy without always offering credits – just contributing would effectively help offset emissions. Forests Without Frontiers in Romania, Tree Aid and the Woodland Trust are personal favourites. Offsetting can work, and it allows people who have to travel to do so with a clearer conscience. But the best strategy must be to reduce your own emissions first. For his 10,200-mile round London to Lilongwe round-trip via Nairobi, John asked eight offsetting companies to calculate his CO2 emissions, how much they would cost to offset, and where the money goes. The results proved highly variable.

"A new generation of national nature reserves are being created to help improve people’s health and mitigate the effects of climatic extremes, according to the chair of the government’s conservation watchdog. The South London Downs reserve is the first in a series of landscapes that will be designated a national nature reserve this year, said Tony Juniper of Natural England. Several more will follow this autumn, including what he described as one “very significant” newly protected area.  Juniper said these new reserves highlighted his austerity-hit agency’s determination to do “the practical work of conservation” that would also help the government meet its target of net zero emissions and help England adapt to global heating. The South London Downs reserve is only the third national nature reserve to be created in the capital, and protects 417 hectares (1,030 acres) of flower-rich chalk downland on the border of Croydon and Surrey. It includes Farthing Downs and Happy valley. Juniper said: “It’s a wonderful area of natural beauty, it’s very close to where people live and another reminder of how much benefit we can get for our society through the intelligent and wise management of the natural environment and its restoration.” In a wide-ranging interview on his vision for Natural England, which he admits has been “massively depleted” by budget cuts, Juniper welcomed Boris Johnson’s reaffirmation of the emissions target and said the agency could play “a central role in helping government meet net zero”. Juniper, who has campaigned on climate change for years as former executive director of Friends of the Earth, said tackling greenhouse gas emissions had so far focused on reducing the use of fossil fuels in energy and domestic heating, and electrifying transport. But he said climate change policy and the nature conservation agenda “should be two sides of the same coin”. Restoring peatland helps capture carbon and prevent flooding, for instance, while forest restoration and wildlife-friendly food production can also sequester more carbon. Juniper also explained how natural systems can help adapt to global heating – such as planting trees in cities to lessen the urban heat island effect during heatwaves. “Improving the health of natural systems is one of our most cost-effective and effective ways of achieving adaptation to climate change,” he said. “The opportunity to harness nature-based solutions is huge but it does require quite a lot of joining up.” According to Juniper, such solutions require a coordinated effort across government and its agencies including Natural England, the Forestry Commission and the Environment Agency. Juniper said he hoped nature could be restored in England through legally binding targets similar to those for climate change, via a post-Brexit environment bill. Biodiversity would be measured using existing datasets on water quality, farmland birds, areas of flower-rich grassland and insect abundance, with successive governments committed to improvement. “It’s really about the extent to which the country wants to own that kind of long-term ambition, and I think we do,” he said. Juniper welcomed the emergence of Extinction Rebellion and the school climate strikes and said such mass protests helped him fight for more resources within government. “Sometimes it’s possible to think there’s some activists and a minority interest calling for big ambitious goals but actually when it appears as it is – a much more mainstream agenda – that helps enormously. When it comes to the children and the school strikes, nobody has got more moral authority than the young people who will own the consequences,” he said. Juniper’s appointment as chair of Natural England in April was a surprise, not least because the influential environmentalist was joining a beleaguered organisation whose funding has been halved over five years. Conservationist critics have attacked Natural England for licensing the badger cull and pursuing hen harrier “brood management” whereby chicks of the endangered bird of prey are removed from nests on grouse moors to help the shooting industry thrive. Juniper signalled his discomfort with the badger cull but said it was the watchdog for nature’s statutory duty to license it as the government instructed. He said: “I think it’s fair to say that Natural England would not have advised that a badger cull should be done but the reality is that we’ve been asked to do it and under the framework agreement that we have with Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] we are obliged to take forward that policy.” Critics of Natural England’s “hen harrier recovery plan” say it rewards lawbreakers, with hen harriers illegally killed to ensure there are enough red grouse to shoot. Juniper cited research by his agency that revealed tagged hen harriers mostly “disappeared” on grouse moors – strong evidence of illegal killing by grouse moor interests. “It’s pretty unequivocal that it is still a problem,” he said. But Juniper also argued that the “brood management” trial was vital to ensure shooting stakeholders assisted the hen harrier’s recovery. “We’ve got more chance of convincing those people to come on the journey if they can see that they’ve got part of what they think is the solution for them also on the table,” he said. “My only benchmark is whether the hen harrier recovers or not. That’s all I’m concerned about.” Juniper said he had not yet been promised any extra resources to help Natural England but he was determined to show that looking after the natural environment was not a cost, but “an essential investment in the future of our country”. “We know that dividend from healthy nature is bigger than ever,” he said. “This is an investment in the nation’s health but also an investment in resilience against climate change, it’s an investment in essential infrastructure in terms of flood protection and water purity and it’s also an investment in long-term food security because in the end all our food comes from nature. “Too often it’s been easy to see the environment as an inconvenience that’s getting in the way of development and progress. It’s the exact opposite – by investing in nature we make the country stronger and better.”"
"‘I no longer think of this as a technological problem. I don’t think of it as a political problem.” Alanna Mitchell is assessing the climate emergency. “I think of it as a cultural problem.” The Canadian journalist and playwright believes the arts play a key role in transforming public opinion. “That’s the way humans understand the world,” insists Mitchell. “We understand it in terms of narrative.” Some of the most successful environmental activism has used theatrical or artistic gestures to capture imaginations. Think of Extinction Rebellion’s dramatic funeral marches, or Liberate Tate’s oil spill installations. At the Edinburgh festival this month, theatre-makers are bringing the crisis to the fore, from drawing the links between colonialism and the changing climate in Kiinalik: These Sharp Tools to Tom Bailey’s meditation on the sixth mass extinction in Vigil.  Theatre is not Mitchell’s natural environment. “I’m not a performer, I’m a journalist,” she stresses. But transforming her 2010 book Sea Sick into a solo show allowed her to reach different audiences with her message about the terrifying impact of carbon emissions on our seas. “We are changing the chemistry of the ocean. And not just part of it – the whole global ocean down to a kilometre deep.” Facing the magnitude of such findings can be overwhelming. As theatre-maker Anita Rochon puts it, the climate crisis throws into question our entire existence and ways of living. Her show Pathetic Fallacy, which is playing at Edinburgh’s Canada Hub alongside Sea Sick, explores humanity’s complex relationship with the elements, from weather gods to the naming of storms, circling around the climate crisis without ever directly discussing it. Pathetic Fallacy also confronts something that eco-theatre has been coy about: the environmental impact of making and touring theatre shows. The play is taken on by a different local actor at each performance, removing the need for Rochon to jet around the world. The British theatre company Boxed In are also trying to make the way in which theatre is made more environmentally friendly. Throughout the Edinburgh fringe, their purpose-built venue The Greenhouse – constructed entirely from recycled materials and doing without mains electricity – will be hosting shows and workshops responding to the climate emergency. As part of their zero-waste commitment, the company will be marketing the programme without a single flyer. “We need to make these big leaps so that we can show it’s possible, and so that hopefully other people will take up the mantle,” says artistic director Oli Savage. At the Edinburgh international festival, meanwhile, a residency by the Royal Court theatre involves writers from Brazil, China, India, South Africa and Syria to highlight global perspectives on the climate emergency that we rarely hear in the UK.  All these theatre-makers identify a renewed sense of urgency around the climate crisis, largely thanks to the actions of the school strikers and Extinction Rebellion (which is curating a season of work at Edinburgh’s Summerhall venue). But these artists see themselves as storytellers, not activists: their role is not to provide solutions but to provoke thought. “People always ask me after my play, ‘So what’s the one thing I need to do tomorrow to make this better?’” says Mitchell, explaining that she refuses to answer. “I hope you go home and you’re awake all night trying to think about what it is that you can do.” Rochon agrees. “There’s not a bit at the end where I say, ‘Here are the resources you can check out afterwards and here’s five things that we can do,’” she says. “I think we all know what we can do.” Savage’s mindset is the same: “We’re not imparting ideas so much as inviting people to discuss ideas with us.”  Greta Thunberg has urged world leaders to “act as if our house is on fire”. But artists do not all agree. “We don’t want [audiences] to be scared and running about panicking,” says Savage, insisting on the importance of hope. The Royal Court’s international associate director Sam Pritchard agrees, observing a hint of optimism in how writers are addressing the climate crisis. “A dire prognosis is not the only artistic tone, voice or response to this subject,” he suggests. At its most ambitious, this work challenges audiences, theatres and other artists to completely rethink the system. “The way we make art now can’t be the way we continue to make art,” says Savage. “Just like the way that society functions can’t be the way that it continues to function if we’re hoping to avert this oncoming crisis.”"
"Australia has been accused of using a loophole to back out of a promised emissions cut nearly eight times greater than the combined annual fossil fuel pollution released by the rest of the Pacific. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, arrived in Tuvalu for the Pacific Islands Forum on Wednesday, facing calls that he take steps to quickly reverse Australia’s rising greenhouse gas emissions, including moving away from coal.  Pacific leaders are also urging Australia to drop its plan to use an accounting loophole to meet the emissions reduction pledge it made at the 2015 Paris climate conference. Enele Sopoaga, Tuvalu’s prime minister, told the ABC that Australia’s commitment to spend $500m from the existing aid budget for climate resilience and adaptation in the Pacific was a good gesture, but ultimately immoral if it was meant to stop countries talking about the need to cut emissions. Analysts say so-called “Kyoto credits” that Australia wants to use to help meet its target do not represent additional emissions reductions or help meet the Paris goal of limiting global heating to as close to 1.5C as possible. Instead, they are a fudge that cuts what Australia needs to do to meet its 2030 emissions target roughly in half. The Australia Institute, a progressive thinktank, compared the scale of the loophole with the emissions released by other countries at the Pacific Islands Forum. The Morrison government says it will use Kyoto credits equivalent to 367m tonnes of carbon dioxide to help meet its 2030 target (a 26-28% reduction below 2005 levels). By comparison, the combined annual fossil fuel emissions from the other 16 forum members, including New Zealand, is about 45 million tonnes. Richie Merzian from the Australia Institute said Australia’s plan was an insult to Pacific leaders and undermined the region’s efforts to address the climate crisis. He said the institute’s analysis illustrated why Morrison faced heavy criticism in the lead-up to the forum. He said other developed countries, including New Zealand, Britain and Germany, had ruled out using the credits. “Scott Morrison has a choice. Australia can be a leader in the region and a partner in combating the impact of climate change or we can continue to completely undermine any efforts by our Pacific partners by using these dodgy credits,” he said. Unlike carbon credits created through offset projects such as tree planting, Kyoto credits do not represent an additional reduction in carbon dioxide. They have been created under the Kyoto protocol, which is set to expire next year. Under that agreement, developed countries set their own targets. For Australia, that was an 8% increase in emissions between 1990 and 2012, and then a 5% cut compared with 2000 levels by 2020. These targets have been criticised as being not up to what scientists say Australia needs to do to play its part in addressing the climate problem. The government says Australia did better than its first-stage Kyoto target and is on track to beat its low 2020 target. Under the rules of the Kyoto protocol, it can choose to claim credits equivalent to the amount of emissions by which it beat its target. But analysts say the idea behind Kyoto credits was to encourage countries to set ambitious targets and strive to beat them. In reality, they have been used to help countries do less. They say Australia has access to the credits only because it set what have been widely described as unambitious targets. Merzian said other OECD-member countries had ruled out using Kyoto credits to meet targets under the new Paris agreement, which officially begins in 2021. It is still unclear how Kyoto credits will be treated under the Paris deal. Governments are expected to explain how they will meet their targets and, unless there is unanimous agreement to ban them, Australia could just potentially choose to include them. Observers say a decision to do this would be likely to spark increasing criticism at climate talks. The Paris agreement says countries will do more to cut emissions over time, and set targets that reflect their “highest possible ambition”. Analysts says Kyoto credits breach this part of the agreement as they transparently weaken a country’s ambition. The government has defended the use of Kyoto credits as part of its “responsible, achievable and balanced commitments” to reduce emissions and said it had a strong track record in meeting and beating climate targets."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Germany-based European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) here recently reminded readers of two things: 1) renewable energies are performing woefully and temperature trends for Germany are pretty much flat, meaning they do not even remotely resemble anything you’d expect from a rapidly warming globe.
=================================================
A look at the “climate-rescuing” new energies
By Helmut Kuntz
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
This comment pretty much remains the same as the last one posted for October. Also in November the new energies have proven their uselessness. Supposedly they are already delivering 35% of the electric power demand – however only in the rare times that it actually gets produced.
Overall there are still no signs of a “reliable supply” and baseload capability to be seen anywhere.

Germany’s November plots for demand (red), wind power (blue) and solar power (yellow). Often both sun a wind were practically AWOL. Source: R. Schuster
If the installed green power capacity were to be tripled, then the result would look like that shown in the following chart. Consumption would still not be able to be covered – even using (currently unavailable) storage capacity. What’s glaring is the low level power yield seen in November with regards to the installed capacity. The power grids have to be designed to handle the rated installed capacity.
One can already imagine the feed-in act-related installation madness that remains ahead for Germany.

The above chart clearly shows that even a tripling of installed rated capacity to 270,000 MW would still not even come close to covering Germany’s electricity needs.
Very little warming in November since 1962
On temperature in Germany, the following chart shows the mean temperature for November, starting in 1962. A rapid heating looks much different.

Also November shows an unbelievable normalcy with respect to climate. The great breakaway change predicted by computer simulations is still nowhere in sight.

"Port Beach in Fremantle and South Thomson Bay at Rottnest Island have been identified as the top two Western Australian locations at risk of coastal erosion. In a report released on Monday, the state government listed 55 places where coastal erosion is expected to threaten homes, roads and other public assets over the next 25 years.  At Port Beach, which is among 15 hotspots in the Perth metropolitan area, this winter’s storms caused a car park to collapse and left buildings teetering on the edge. The council used earthmovers to pile up sand as a temporary protective measure but the Fremantle mayor, Brad Pettitt, said substantially pushing back existing infrastructure, including Port Beach Road, was needed in the long term. The WA government estimated the cost for managing the 55 locations could be up to $110m over the next five years and said it was seeking federal funding contributions. It is focused on seawalls and groynes, and the premier, Mark McGowan, said retreat was a last resort. McGowan said he wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, about the federal government working with the states to tackle the climate crisis-related issue, which needed more than piecemeal solutions. He promised to raise the matter again at the Council of Australian Governments on Friday. “I think it deserves a national coordinated response ... [it’s] going to dramatically impact communities and infrastructure for decades if not centuries to come,” McGowan told reporters on Monday. Where industry was present, like Kwinana Beach, it would be asked to contribute, McGowan said. The tiny hamlet of Seabird north of Perth, where a seawall was built several years ago to stop homes being swallowed by the ocean, remained on the hotspot list. One of Perth’s most popular beaches, North Cottesloe, was among 31 locations that have been placed on a watch-list for future monitoring. At nearby Cottesloe Beach, billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest planned to replace the well-known landmark Indiana Tea House with a large new development, although keeping the existing building remained an option. Four ambitious designs, all including a beachside pool, have been narrowed down to two. Critics said the designs were too big and too close to the shore. A spokeswoman for Forrest’s Minderoo Group said managing environmental factors including coastal erosion was being considered as part of the design process. “Once a preferred option is chosen, it will be refined by architects and other consultants to mitigate any risks in this regard,” she said. Most of the hotspots are in the regions, including the historic China Town in Broome and Monkey Mia in the Shire of Shark Bay, which is famous for its dolphins."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs mentioned here yesterday, Germany saw sunny and very windy conditions last Sunday and the following national holiday Monday –leading to a huge power surge into the German power grid. But because many industries were closed during these two days, demand for electricity was low, see chart below:

German consumption (blue line), wind power dark and light blue shaded area) and solar power (yellow shaded area). Source: Agora here.
The chart above also shows both the very high infusion of solar, onshore and offshore wind into the German power grid on April 30th and early May, and the low overall demand.
The result: Huge supply + little demand = crashing prices.
The huge feed-in of wind and solar energy did not occur without problems, especially in the southern state of Bavaria, the German online BR24 reports here.
BR24 writes that for the first time ever in Bavaria “wind turbines had to be shut down on a large scale – because there was too much power in the grid,” this according to the Bundesverband Windenergie (Federal Association for Wind Energy). There was also criticism that the wind turbines were shut down instead of the state’s nuclear plants.

BR24 adds that “many wind turbines in Bavaria had to stop for hours because no one wanted to take the power” and that this was the first time this had ever happened in Bavaria.
According to the Fraunhofer Institute, “two thirds of Germany’s conventional power production was switched off” on Sunday in order to prevent the grid from turning into a giant toaster.
And because the base load (the grid’s backbone) cannot be adjusted rapidly or taken offline line to meet the rapid changes, the BR24 adds:
But the coal power plants continued to operate – despite the negative power prices of minus ten cents per kilowatt-hour.”
It’s not possible to turn off the coal plants because once you do, the critical baseload disappears and the grid risks becoming an uncontrollable wild bronco.
And when you are forced to sell your very own product at a negative price (minus ten cents per kilowatt-hour) just to get rid of it, then you get a pretty good idea of just how obscenely distorted the market has become because of wind and solar.
Yet the energy masterminds of Germany and Europe intend to double or even quadruple this folly in the future.
So what about the losses incurred from the negative prices? You guessed it! They will be passed along to the German consumers, who already pay among the highest electricity rates in the world.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWikipedia and the Hamburg Forsythia Patch
by Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Josef Kowatsch
(Translated and rewritten by P Gosselin)
At the Hamburg Binnenalster near the Lombard Bridge, one finds a particular patch of forsythia, which blossoms every year when spring arrives at the north German port city. And just days ago on March 24, 2017, the famous patch blossomed again as it does every year.
So what’s the big deal about a spring flower patch blossoming in the spring?
It turns out that this particular patch is in fact one of great scientific interest as it has been scientifically observed since 1945. The dates at which the flowers blossom have been carefully recorded each year.
In the age of “rapid, unprecedented global warming”, you’d think that the blossoms would be appearing earlier and earlier as the global climate heats up like NASA insists it is. So it is all the more surprising that the data show that the opposite is in fact happening: the trend over the past 30 years is that this particular patch is blossoming later and later, indicating harsher and harsher winters.
Despite this year’s seemingly early spring in Europe, the most recent 2017 data point of the Hamburg Lombard Bridge forsythia blossoms in fact fits right with the overall 30 year trend.

Figure 1: The blossoming date of the Hamburg Lombard Bridge forsythia patch over the past 30 years with linear trend. The Y-axis is the number of days from the start of the year (January 1st). Spring at the site is arriving 3 weeks later!
The reason for the increasingly delayed spring blossoms likely has much to do with the trend of colder months of February over the past 30 years:

Wikipedia censors, cherrypicks and disinforms
Lüning and Kowatsch add that because of the Lombard Bridge forsythia patch’s significance, it even has its own Wikipedia page.
The two authors at the Die kalte Sonne site note that Wikipedia makes no mention whatsoever of the later blossoms trend. In fact one skeptic who wishes to remain anonymous actually logged in the Wikipedia site and suggested the following important addition on the now famous Hamburg forsythia blossoms:
Over the past 50 years there’s been a detectable trend of earlier blossoming. However since 1988 the blossoming date of the Hamburg forsythia has been again coming later.[3]“
This is a perfectly legitimate scientific statement that notes fairly both a trend of earlier blossoms on one hand, and on the other hand the current trend of the past 30 years, where the blossoms have been appearing later. The official long-term dataset since 1945 can be viewed at this DWD website (second chart, yellow curve).
So did the Wikipedia editors allow the added information? Lüning and Kowatsch write:
It did not even take a half hour, before the additional information was taken down. The reason according to page editor “DeWikiMan”: The trend of later blossoming over the past 30 years is not sufficiently statistically established.”
Lüning and Kowatch refer readers to Figure 1 above, and of course characterize DeWikiMan’s reasoning as somewhat absurd, before going on to show that the Wikipedia editor is in fact an activist and a “classic gatekeeper”: Wikipedia profile here. They depict DeWikiMan as a cherry-picker and purveyor of disinformation, and suggest that Wikipedia ought to take a much closer look at this editor.
Lüning and Kowatsch summarize:
It is a pity that the original excellent concept of a voluntarily written online encyclopedia has been hijacked by political activists and rendered useless in a number of sensitive subjects areas”

"The Daily Express is calling it “the Boris effect”. Johnson’s election has reportedly caused a “record jump” in the polls for the Conservative party, with the Telegraph gleefully reporting that its prized former columnist has received the largest bounce of any Conservative leader in the past two decades. Though Tory hopes were dented by the party’s defeat in Thursday’s Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, supporters still believe Johnson is capable of winning a general election – which could happen within months.  And there are those on the newly energised right who feel that, after three years of the dour Theresa May, the sheer force of Johnson’s “personality” or “charisma” – yet to be convincingly defined – could yet bring young people into the fold and unite the country around a hard Brexit. His time as London mayor is often cited as evidence that a brand of socially liberal, business-friendly leadership can be repackaged and sold to younger voters. They are wrong. The disgust felt at the Brexit crisis that has consumed the past three years is difficult to overstate. The fanatical commitment of the Conservative membership to leaving the EU on 31 October, “do or die”, bears no resemblance to the wishes of the vast majority of young people, eight in 10 of whom want to resolve this crisis through a people’s vote. Johnson’s new cabinet, packed with Brexit purists, sends a clear message to young people: we do not represent you and we do not share your values. Faced with the choice of winning back support from the Brexit party or reaching out to unite the country, Johnson has unapologetically opted for the former. His cabinet is filled with ministers who are either deluded enough to believe no deal is a good thing or so devoid of principle, they are willing to pretend so in return for a seat at the table. A recent Barnardo’s report found that more young people think Brexit is an immediate threat to their future than is climate change. When Johnson wrote of the Extinction Rebellion protests in April that he was “utterly fed up with being told by nice young people that their opinions are more important than my own”, few would expect him to think otherwise for our concerns about Brexit. It has become clearer with each day that has passed since the 2016 referendum that Brexit – in any form – will leave us poorer, our opportunities fewer and our domestic priorities irrelevant amid the long-term political chaos that would follow. The Bank of England now warns of a one in three chance of recession – and that’s even if there is a deal. The damage to the economy is incontestable, and yet the single most destructive form of Brexit is about to be forced upon us without our consent. No prime minister championing this could even expect acquiescence from future generations, let alone support. And even if young people were in fact in favour of Brexit, they would still reject Johnson. This is a politician who, regardless of his personal beliefs, is happy to dabble in misogyny, xenophobia and homophobia as far as it appeals to those whose support he needs. This is a man who has described women wearing the burqa as “letterboxes”, claimed “voting Tory will cause your wife to have bigger breasts” and described gay men as “tank-topped bumboys”. His values are the antithesis of a forward-looking generation who want to see borders eradicated, not reimposed. It is why Stormzy got the crowd to sing “Fuck Boris” during his headline set at Glastonbury in June, and why T-shirts emblazoned with the same slogan have been selling in huge numbers since.  This is a prime minister whose cause is neither Brexit, nor Britain. It’s Boris. Johnson clearly believes that his political survival is best served by ignoring and alienating my generation, and MPs flock to him in the hope he’ll save their seat in the process. We’re under no such illusion: a Johnson premiership leaves our futures at the bottom of the pile. And if he does call a general election he’ll quickly consider the thousands of young people who protested in London on his first day in office a happy memory. Because many, many more will be sure to make themselves heard – on the streets, yes, but at the ballot box too. • Lara Spirit is co-president of Our Future Our Choice"
"News that the British government is planning to withdraw from participation in EU meetings in the coming days is another ruse by Dominic Cummings and Boris Johnson to “send a message to Europe” that the UK is leaving with or without a deal. Pulling out from day-to-day EU business in this way only serves to further diminish what remains of British influence. But such a reckless PR stunt will have minimal impact on the Brexit outcome. Brussels negotiators are waiting instead to see if members of the UK parliament can get their act together and stop a no-deal exit in September.  Meanwhile, however, I can see at first-hand how, step by step, Johnson is reducing the UK’s influence, making us less able to shape the policies that affect British people, from fisheries policies to the climate crisis. It doesn’t have to be like this. The UK does not have to be a regional and global embarrassment. We do not have to face a future on the sidelines. We do not have to allow Brexiteers to claim the mantle of patriotism. For the moment they have the initiative and are selling the inevitability of Brexit, with the only question being whether the UK crashes out or leaves in an orderly fashion. The time is long overdue for remainers to seize the national flag and gain the higher ground. Why have the Brexiteers been allowed for so long to portray themselves as heroic defenders of our national interest? By turning their back on the EU they are running away from the issues facing our continent, problems that every nation faces but which no one country can resolve alone. This is not heroism, it’s cowardice. Europe’s climate problems are our problems and, with the UK emitting just 1% of global greenhouse emissions, only through a collective approach can we hope to have real influence in shaping global policy. Europe’s borders are our borders, at least where the mass movement of people is concerned, which is certainly likely over decades to come. Our security interests are shared, whether to fight terrorism or counter the less than benign influences of Russia and China. The values of democracy, pluralism and the protection of minorities that are enshrined in the EU treaties risk being undermined from within by the “illiberal democracies” of Hungary and Poland. The UK should be at the heart of their defence. Margaret Thatcher set out in her 1988 Bruges speech a position which all remainers today can endorse: “Britain does not dream of some cosy, isolated existence on the fringes of the European Community. Our destiny is in Europe, as part of the Community.” Thatcher wouldn’t have tolerated Johnson’s withdrawal from European tables of influence. I suspect Winston Churchill would be horrified. How might a transformation be brought about? If Brexit can be stopped, then the government of the day must change the language of debate, emphasising a newfound commitment to the EU and the mutual benefit to be gained from working together. Of course, the fact that the UK has its own currency and is not within the Schengen area will limit its role on occasion, but a display of solidarity would help rebuild trust shattered by years of divorce talk. A practical step would be for British ministers to get to know their opposite numbers across Europe. In a Europe of 28 countries, ministers are constantly changing, so a commitment of time has to be made if relationships are to be fostered. Ministers need to reach out and put in that time. Once back around the table as a serious player, the UK can take the most important step of all. It can table proposals for reforms intended to drive the EU forward and address the concerns of its citizens. We need not be ashamed of wanting to be citizens of a strong country that plays a leading role in the shaping of our continent. We can reject Little England while embracing the wish for a UK in Europe to be truly great. We should be leaders, not leavers. • Chris Davies is a Liberal Democrat politician and MEP"

CO2 Concentration Changes 
Do Not Drive Sea Levels

From about 7000 years ago to 2000 years ago, or from the Mid- to Late-Holocene, atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied between only about 260 and 270 parts per million, or ppm.  Such low CO2 concentrations are believed to be “safe” for the planet, as they are significantly lower than today’s levels, which have eclipsed 400 ppm in recent years.  These high CO2 concentrations are believed to cause dangerous warming, rapid glacier melt, and catastrophic sea level rise.
And yet, despite the surge in anthropogenic CO2 emissions and atmospheric CO2 since the 20th century began, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that global sea levels only rose by 1.7 mm/yr during the entire 1901-2010 period, which is a rate of less than 7 inches (17 cm) per century.   A new paper even suggests the global trend is better represented as closer to 1.3 mm/yr, or about 5 inches per century:
McAneney et al., 2017     “Global averaged sea-level rise is estimated at about 1.7 ± 0.2 mm year−1 (Rhein et al. 2013), however, this global average rise ignores any local land movements. Church et al. (2006) and J. A. Church (2016; personal communication) suggest a long-term average rate of relative (ocean relative to land) sea-level rise of ∼1.3 mm year.”
According to Wenzel and Schröter (2014), the acceleration rate for the sea level rise trend since 1900 has been just +0.0042 mm/yr, which is acknowledged by the authors to be “not significant” and well within the range of uncertainty (+ or – 0.0092 mm/yr) to put the overall 20th/21st century sea level rise acceleration rate at zero.
Further complicating the paradigm that contends changes in CO2 concentrations drive sea levels is the fact that ice core evidence affirms CO2 levels remained remarkably constant (fluctuating around 255 to 260 ppm) during the same period that there was an explosively fast rate of sea level rise — between 1 and 2 meters per century (about 10 times today’s rates) — between 12,000 to 8,000 years ago.    Sea levels rose by ~60 meters during those 4,000 years while CO2 levels effectively remained constant.
And casting even more doubt on the assertion that variations in CO2 drive sea level rise is the fact that there is robust paleoclimate evidence to suggest that today’s mean sea levels as well as today’s sea level rise rates are both relatively low (from a historical standpoint) and also well within the range of natural variability.  Nothing unusual is happening to sea levels today.  For even though we have evidence that modern CO2 concentrations (~405 ppm) are historically high relative to the last 10,000 years, we also possess a growing body of evidence that modern sea levels are still about 1 to 2 meters lower than they have been for most of the last 7,000 years.
The fundamental problem for the CO2-rise-causes-sea-level-rise paradigm, then, is that rising CO2 concentrations have not been correlated with rising sea levels for nearly all of the last 12,000 years.  In fact, the opposite has been observed during the last 2,000 years, or during the Late Holocene: CO2 levels have risen (gradually, then rapidly) while sea levels have fallen overall, with recent changes so modest (inches per century) that they do not override the overall trend.   In the 8,000 years before that, sea levels rose rapidly while CO2 concentrations remained flat.  Simply put, the supposed anthropogenic “signal” in sea level rise trends has largely gone undetected — a point that has been affirmed by more and more scientists.
Listed below are a collection of 35 scientific papers published since 2014 that indicate sea levels were, on average, about 1 to 2 meters higher than they are now throughout the Mid-Holocene (7,000-2,000 years ago) and even into the last millennium, with lower-than-now sea levels largely confined to the Little Ice Age period (~1300 to 1900 AD).  Links to the papers are embedded in the authors’ names and the regional locations for mean sea level are notated.

Dechnik et al., 2017 (Tropical Western Pacific)
[I]t is generally accepted that relative sea level reached a maximum of 1–1.5 m above present mean sea level (pmsl) by ~7 ka [7,000 years ago] (Lewis et al., 2013)

Zondervan, 2016    (Great Barrier Reef, Australia)
Preserved fossil coral heads as indicators of Holocene high sea level on One Tree Island [GBR, Australia] … Complete in-situ fossil coral heads have been found on beach rock of One Tree Island, a small cay in the Capricorn Group on the Great Barrier Reef. Measurements against the present low-tide mark provide a [Holocene] high stand of at least +2.85 m [above present sea levels], which can be determined in great accuracy compared to other common paleo sea-level record types like mangrove facies. The sea level recorded here is higher than most recent findings, but supports predictions by isostatic adjustment models. … Although the late Holocene high stand has been debated in the past (e.g. Belperio 1979, Thom et al. 1968), more evidence now supports a sea level high stand of at least + 1- 2 m relative to present sea levels (Baker & Haworth 1997, 2000, Collins et al. 2006, Larcombe et al. 1995, Lewis et al. 2008, Sloss et al. 2007).

Prieto et al., 2016  (Argentina, Uruguay)
Analysis of the RSL [relative sea level] database revealed that the RSL [relative sea level] rose to reach the present level at or before c. 7000 cal yr BP, with the peak of the sea-level highstand c. +4 m [above present] between c. 6000 and 5500 cal yr BP [calendar years before present] … This RSL [relative sea level] curve was re-plotted by Gyllencreutz et al. (2010) using the same index points and qualitative approach but using the calibrated ages. It shows rising sea-levels following the Last Glacial Termination (LGT), reaching a RSL [relative sea level] maximum of +6.5 m above present at c. 6500 cal yr BP [calendar years before present], followed by a stepped regressive trend towards the present.


Hodgson et al., 2016  (East Antarctica)
Rapid early Holocene sea-level rise in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica … The field data show rapid increases in rates of relative sea level rise of 12–48 mm/yr [1.2 to 4.8 meters per century] between 10,473 (or 9678) and 9411 cal yr BP in the Vestfold Hills and of 8.8 mm/yr between 8882 and 8563 cal yr BP in the Larsemann Hills. … The geological data imply a regional RSL [relative sea level] high stand of c. 8 m [above present levels], which persisted between 9411 cal yr BP and 7564 cal yr BP [calendar years before present], and was followed by a period when deglacial sea-level rise was almost exactly cancelled out by local rebound.


Dura et al., 2016  (Vancouver)
In northern and western Sumatra, GIA models predict high rates (>5 mm/year) of RSL [relative sea level] rise from ∼12 to ∼7 ka [12000 to 7000 years ago], followed by slowing rates of rise (<1 mm/year) to an RSL [relative sea level] highstand of <1 m (northern Sumatra) and ∼3 m (western Sumatra) between 6 and 3 ka [6,000-3,000 years ago], and then gradual (<1 mm/ year) RSL fall until present.


Spotorno-Oliveira et al., 2016  (Brazil)
At ~7000 cal. years BP the sea level in the bay was approximately 4 m below the present sea level and the upper subtidal benthic community was characterised by fruticose corallines on coarse soft substrate, composed mainly of quartz grains from continental runoff input. The transgressing sea rapidly rose until reaching the ~ +4 m highstand [above present] level around 5000 years BP.

Lee et al., 2016  (Southeast Australia)
The configuration suggests surface inundation of the upper sediments by marine water during the mid-Holocene (c. 2–8 kyr BP), when sea level was 1–2 m above today’s level.


Yokoyama et al., 2016  (Japan)
The Holocene-high-stand (HHS) inferred from oyster fossils (Saccostrea echinata and Saccostrea malaboensis) is 2.7 m [above present sea level] at ca. 3500 years ago, after which sea level gradually fell to present level.

May et al., 2016  (Western Australia)
Beach ridge evolution over a millennial time scale is also indicated by the landward rise of the sequence possibly corresponding to the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand of WA [Western Australia] of at least 1-2 m above present mean sea level.

Mann et al., 2016  (Indonesia)
Radiometrically calibrated ages from emergent fossil microatolls on Pulau Panambungan indicate a relative sea-level highstand not exceeding 0.5 m above present at ca. 5600 cal. yr BP [calendar years before present].

Clement et al., 2016   (New Zealand)
In North Island locations the early-Holocene sea-level highstand was quite pronounced, with RSL [relative sea level] up to 2.75 m higher than present. In the South Island the onset of highstand conditions was later, with the first attainment of PMSL being between 7000–6400 cal yr BP. In the mid-Holocene the northern North Island experienced the largest sea-level highstand, with RSL up to 3.00 m higher than present.


Long et al., 2016  (Scotland)
RSL [relative sea level] data from Loch Eriboll and the Wick River Valley show that RSL [relative sea level] was <1 m above present for several thousand years during the mid and late Holocene before it fell to present.

Chiba et al., 2016  (Japan)
Highlights: We reconstruct Holocene paleoenvironmental changes and sea levels by diatom analysis.  Average rates of sea-level rise and fall are estimated during the Holocene.  Relative sea level during Holocene highstand reached 1.9 m [higher than today] during 6400–6500 cal yr BP [calendar years before present].  The timing of this sea-level rise is at least 1000 years earlier in the Lake Inba area by Holocene uplift than previous studies.  The decline of sea-level after 4000 cal yr BP may correspond to the end of melting of the Antarctic ice sheet.

Leonard et al., 2016  (Great Barrier Reef, Australia)
Holocene sea level instability in the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia … Three emergent subfossil reef flats from the inshore Keppel Islands, Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, were used to reconstruct relative sea level (RSL). Forty-two high-precision uranium–thorium (U–Th) dates obtained from coral microatolls and coral colonies (2σ age errors from ±8 to 37 yr) in conjunction with elevation surveys provide evidence in support of a nonlinear RSL regression throughout the Holocene. RSL [relative sea level] was at least 0.75 m above present from ~6500 to 5500 yr before present (yr BP; where “present” is 1950). Following this highstand, two sites indicated a coeval lowering of RSL of at least 0.4 m from 5500 to 5300 yr BP which was maintained for ~200 yr. After the lowstand, RSL returned to higher levels before a 2000-yr hiatus in reef flat corals after 4600 yr BP at all three sites. A second possible RSL lowering event of ~0.3 m from ~2800 to 1600 yr BP was detected before RSL stabilised ~0.2 m above present levels by 900 yr BP. While the mechanism of the RSL instability is still uncertain, the alignment with previously reported RSL oscillations, rapid global climate changes and mid-Holocene reef “turn-off” on the GBR are discussed.


Sander et al., 2016  (Denmark)
The data show a period of RSL [relative sea level] highstand at c. 2.2 m above present MSL [mean sea level] between c. 5.0 and 4.0 ka BP [5,000 to 4,000 years before present].  After that, RSL drops by c. 1.3 m between c. 4.0 and 3.4 ka BP to an elevation roughly 1 m above present MSL. Since then, RSL has been falling at more or less even rates. … Yu et al. (2007) present evidence for a sea-level ‘jump’ of several meters occurring at 7.6 ka bp [7600 years before present] in SE Sweden, and data suggesting RSL changes with a similar timing and magnitude were obtained for a field site in the southern Gulf of Finland (Rosentau et al., 2013). The suddenness of the RSL change has been attributed to the collapse of parts of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (Blanchon and Shaw, 1995; Carlson et al., 2007), though the global indications and the potential triggers of such a eustatic event remain inconclusive (Törnqvist and Hijma, 2012).

Bradley et al., 2016  (China)
In general, the data indicate a marked slowdown between 7 and 8 kyr BP, with sea level rising steadily to form a highstand of ~2-4 m [above present sea level] between 6 and 4 kyr BP [6000 and 4000 years before present]. This is followed by a steady fall, reaching present day levels by ~1 kyr BP.


Accordi and Carbone, 2016  (Africa)
Then, the skeletal carbonate storage on the shelf reached its maximum 5 to 4 ka BP [5000 to 4000 years before present] (Ramsay, 1995) during a highstand about 3.5 m above the present sea level, when shallow marine accommodation space was greater than at present. … A detailed sea level curve of the last 9 ka BP is reported for the Southern African coastline by Ramsay (1995), who indicates a sea level similar to that of the present (at about 6.5 ka). Ramsay also indicates successive, frequent oscillations below and above the present sea level, between a maximum of +3.5 and a minimum of -2 m. Sea level positive pulses since 7 ka BP are also documented in Siesser (1974), Jaritz et al. (1977) and Norstrom et al. (2012) for the Mozambique coast. Along the Kenyan coast, a sea level stand above the present one during the mid-Holocene is documented in many places along the coast by various authors (Hori, 1970; Toyah et al., 1973; Åse, 1981, 1987; Oosterom, 1988), where the sea level might have reached +6 m above the Kenyan Datum between 2 and 3 ka BP [2000 and 3000 years before present].


Hansen et al., 2016  (Denmark)
Continuous record of Holocene sea-level changes … (4900 years BP to present). … The curve reveals eight centennial sea-level oscillations of 0.5-1.1 m superimposed on the general trend of the RSL [relative sea level] curve [relative sea levels ~1.5 m higher than present from 1400 to 1000 years ago].

Macreadie et al., 2015  (Austalia, Eastern)
[R]esults from other studies … suggest that high-stand, at perhaps 2 m above present msl [mean sea level] was achieved as early as 7000 radiocarbon years BP [before present] (7800 cal. years BP) and that sea-level has exceeded the present value for much of the mid- to late-Holocene [~7000 to ~1000 years ago].

Lewis et al., 2015  (Australia, Northeastern)
Thick (> 10 cm) fossil oyster visors above the equivalent modern growth suggest higher relative sea-levels in the past (i.e. > 1200 cal. yr BP [prior to 1,200 years before present]). … [D]ata show a Holocene sea-level highstand of 1–2 m higher than present which extended from ca. 7500 to 2000 yr ago (Woodroffe, 2003; Sloss et al., 2007; Lewis et al., 2013). The hydro-isostatic adjustment is thought to account for these 1–2 m sea-level changes [falling] to present levels over the past 2000 yr (Lambeck and Nakada, 1990; Lambeck, 2002). … [R]eliable SLI data such as coral pavements and tubeworms from Western Australia suggest that relative sea-level was 0.86 m and 0.80 m above present at 1060 ± 10 and 1110 ± 170 cal. yr BP [~1100 calendar years before present], respectively (Baker et al., 2005; Collins et al., 2006).

Lokier et al., 2015  (Persian Gulf)
Late Quaternary reflooding of the Persian Gulf climaxed with the mid-Holocene highstand previously variously dated between 6 and 3.4 ka. Examination of the stratigraphic and paleoenvironmental context of a mid-Holocene whale beaching allows us to accurately constrain the timing of the transgressive, highstand and regressive phases of the mid- to late Holocene sea-level highstand in the Persian Gulf.  Mid-Holocene transgression of the Gulf surpassed today’s sea level by 7100–6890 cal yr BP, attaining a highstand of > 1 m above current sea level shortly after 5290–4570 cal yr BP before falling back to current levels by 1440–1170 cal yr BP.  These new ages refine previously reported timings for the mid- to late Holocene sea-level highstand published for other regions. By so doing, they allow us to constrain the timing of this correlatable global eustatic event more accurately.


Harris et al., 2015   (Great Barrier Reef, Australia)
This hiatus in sediment infill coincides with a sea-level fall of ∼1–1.3 m during the late Holocene (ca. 2000 cal. yr B.P.), which would have caused the turn-off of highly productive live coral growth on the reef flats currently dominated by less productive rubble and algal flats, resulting in a reduced sediment input to back-reef environments and the cessation in sand apron accretion. Given that relative sea-level variations of ∼1 m were common throughout the Holocene, we suggest that this mode of sand apron development and carbonate production is applicable to most reef systems.
Microatoll death was most likely caused by a fall in sea level that stranded the microatolls on the reef flat due to their location in open-water unmoated environments. This suggests that paleo–sea level between 3900 and 2200 cal. yr B.P. was 1–1.3 m higher than present (based on an offset from MLWS tidal level to fossil microatoll elevation; Fig. 2). This paleo–sealevel elevation is similar to the ranges of 1–1.5 m suggested by Lewis et al. (2013) and Sloss et al. (2007) and data from Moreton Bay in southern Queensland of an elevation of 1.3 m (Leonard et al., 2013).


Hein et al., 2015  (Brazil)
In southern Brazil, falling RSL [relative sea level] following a 2–4 m [above present sea level] highstand at 5 to 6 ka [5,000 to 6,000 years ago] forced coastal progradation. … Relative SL [sea level] along the southern Brazil coast reached a highstand elevation of 1–4 m above MSL [mean sea leve] at ca. 5.8 ka [5800 years ago].

Barnett et al., 2015  (Arctic Norway)
Relative sea-level fell at −0.7 to −0.9 mm yr−1 over the past 3300 years in NW Norway. … Prior to 3000 cal yr BP the marine limiting date represents an important constraint for the late Holocene sea-level trend and yields a minimum RSL [relative sea level] decline of approximately 2.2 m over 3200 years when assuming a linear trend. The maximum possible linear decline constrained by the data is approximately 2.6 m in 2800 years, providing an estimated late Holocene sea-level trend of 0.7 to 0.9 mm yr (shown by the grey shaded region in Fig. 8A).  [Relative sea level was 2.2 to 2.8 m higher ~3,000 years ago in Arctic Norway]


Engel et al., 2015  (Western Australia)
The foredunes overlie upper beach deposits located up to >2 m above the present upper beach level and provide evidence for a higher mid-Holocene RSL [relative sea level]. …  [O]bservations made near Broome by Lessa and Masselink (2006) [indicate] the deposition of backshore deposits up to c. 1.5 m above present MHW [mean high water] between c. 2100–800 cal BP [2100-800 calendar years before present].


Reinink-Smith, 2015  (Kuwait)
[B]ased on bottle characteristics, glass bottles within the debris zonemwere manufactured mostly between 1940 and 1960 (some as early as the 1920s), indicating high tides were more common in the recent past. … The normal tidal cycle affects only a narrow 0.6–0.7 km-wide band parallel to the coast when the prevailing wind (the Shamal) is from the northwest (Gunatilaka, 1986). Within this narrow zone, washed-up glass bottles were manufactured more recently than ~1960 and are not frosted. None of these new [made after 1960] bottles were found near the beach ridges … [A]ssuming the tidal ranges were similar in the middle Holocene, a rough estimate of the MSL [mean sea level] during the middle Holocene highstand is 5.2 m − 1.7 m = +3.5 m above the present MSL [mean sea level]. … The +3.5 m highstand estimate in northeastern Kuwait derived in this study is also higher than the previously reported maximum estimates of +2 to +2.5 m responsible for other Holocene beach ridges in the Arabian Gulf (Gunatilaka, 1986; Lambeck, 1996; Kennett and Kennett, 2007; Jameson and Strohmenger, 2012). Some beach ridges in Qatar and Abu Dhabi are at elevations of 2–4 m above MSL [present mean sea level] as far as 5-15 km inland (Alsharhan and Kendall, 2003).

Rashid et al., 2014  (French Polynesia)
Upon correction for isostatic island subsidence, we find that local relative sea level was at least ~1.5±0.4 m higher than present at ~5,400 years ago.


Strachan et al., 2014  (South Africa)
During the last 7000 years, southern African sea levels have fluctuated by no more than ±3 m. Sea-level curves based on observational data for southern Africa indicate that Holocene highstands occurred at 6000 and again at 4000 cal years BP, followed by a lowstand from 3000 to 2000 cal years B P. The mid-Holocene highstands culminated in a sea-level maximum of approximately 3 m above mean sea level (MSL) from 7300 to 6500 cal years BP [calendar years before present] and of 2 m above MSL at around 4000 cal years BP.  Thereafter, RSL dropped to slightly below the present level between 3500 and 2800 cal years BP.  Sea-level fluctuations during the late Holocene in southern Africa were relatively small (1-2 m); however, these fluctuations had a major impact on past coastal environments.  Evidence from the west coast suggests that there was a highstand of 0.5 m above MSL from 1500 to 1300 cal years BP [calendar years before present] or possibly earlier (1800 cal years BP), followed by a lowstand (-0.5 m above MSL) from 700 to 400 cal years BP [during the Little Ice Age].


Yamano et al., 2014 (Southwest Pacific Ocean)
Mba Island initially formed around ~ 4500 cal yr B.P. [4500 calendar years before present], when sea level was ~ 1.1 m higher than at present. 


Kench et al., 2014  (Central Pacific Ocean)
[T]he mid-Holocene [sea level] highstand is reported to have peaked at approximately +1.1 m above present and was sustained until approximately 2000 years B.P. [before present] in the Marshall Islands.


Hein et al., 2014  (Brazil)
Along the eastern and southern Brazilian coasts of South America, 6000 years of sea-level fall have preserved late-stage transgressive and sea-level highstand features 1–4 m above present mean sea level and several kilometers landward of modern shorelines.


Bracco et al., 2014  (Uruguay)
Highlights:  We present a sea level change curve for mid Holocene in Uruguay.  Sea level reached 4 m amsl [above present mean sea level] between 6000 and 5500 yr BP [before present].   A rapid sea level fall to about 1 m amsl [above present mean sea level] was inferred for 4700-4300 yr BP.  A further sea level increase to about 3 m amsl [above present mean sea level] was inferred after 4300 yr BP.  After 4300 yr BP there was a constant sea level a decline.


Holocene Sea Levels Rose Much Faster With Stable CO2 Levels

Khan et al., 2017  (Caribbean)
Only Suriname and Guyana [Caribbean] exhibited higher RSL [relative sea level] than present (82% probability), reaching a maximum height of ∼1 m at 5.2 ka [5,200 years ago]. … Because of meltwater input, the rates of RSL change were highest during the early Holocene, with a maximum of 10.9 ± 0.6 m/ka [10.9 meters per 1000 years, 1.9 meters per century] in Suriname and Guyana and minimum of 7.4 ± 0.7 m/ka [7.4 meters per 1000 years, 0.74 meters per century] in south Florida from 12 to 8 ka [12,000 to 8,000 years ago].

Zecchin et al., 2015 (Mediterranean)
Episodic, rapid sea-level rises on the central Mediterranean shelves after the Last Glacial Maximum: A review … The evidence presented here confirms drowned shorelines documented elsewhere at similar water depths and shows that melt-water pulses have punctuated the post-glacial relative sea-level rise with rates up to 60 mm/yr. [6 meters per century] for a few centuries. 

Boski et al., 2015 (Brazil)
A rapid sea-level rise, at an averaged rate of approximately 6.1 mm/yr [0.6 m per century], occurred between 8300 and 7000 cal. yr BP [8300-7000 calendar years before present]. Since then, the pace of relative sea-level rise slowed and non-eustatic factors, namely terrigenous sediment supply and coastal dynamics, became dominant in the evolution of the estuary.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEmissions trading was set up to entice fossil fuel intense companies to reduce their CO2 emissions, and thus in this way help bring atmospheric CO2 concentrations to a standstill, and thus rescue the climate, according to the man-made global warming theory.

New report by Carbon Market Watch shows large corporations raking in billions in CO2 emissions trading scheme.
However, things aren’t quite working out that way. Spiegel here cites a comprehensive report by the non-government organization Carbon Market Watch (CMW), which concludes that large companies are in fact making billions from free emissions certificates, and CO2 emissions aren’t improving at all.
The European large industry have managed to squeeze out 25 billion over the past years through special rights in the EU emissions trading system.”
The study looked at the 20 strongest countries from 2008 to 2015, Spiegel writes.
Easy money
Agnes Brandt of the CMW comments:
The figures show how easy it is to make money from pollution and just much the lobby-watered-down CO2 trading system has failed.”

Little wonder that so money companies happily adopted the climate protection and CO2 scam. Many have gotten rich from it without having to produce anything tangible for society to benefit from.
And who pays for the 25 billion? Billy Bob Blow and Jane Blow, of course.
Little wonder voters are voting to “blow up the whole goddamn system” with a “human Molotov cocktail“. And why not, after all? It. Is. Corrupt.
Growing resentment
In Europe too there is an intensifying aura out there that is telling us that more politicians are about to get the message, loud and clear –and big time. The energy system in much of Europe has gotten dearly expensive, unstable and now poses a real and gathering threat to the jobs and livelihoods of millions in the working class. The citizenry has been deceived and screwed over by a climate science scam, and they are not going to take it much longer.
Already tens of thousands of highly skilled, well-paid workers in the automotive and energy industries in Germany alone are seeing their jobs get slashed. And they do have a means of delivering the second biggest FU in history – with a vote for Le Pen in France, or for the emerging hard right wing parties in Germany, Austria and elsewhere.
The biggest earners from the scam, according to the report and Spiegel, are the steel and iron industry, cement, refineries and petrochemicals – to name a few. They are closing down and moving out their operations, and getting paid to do so.
And the working class? They’re getting angry, yet being scolded for doing so — being cast out as “deplorables” or irredeemables”, or even far worse. This can’t and won’t continue.

"The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has hit back at the Australian News Corp columnist Andrew Bolt for writing a deeply offensive column that mocked her autism diagnosis. The Swedish schoolgirl posted a tweet overnight calling out the “hate and conspiracy campaigns” run by climate deniers like Bolt, adopting his insult that she was “deeply disturbed” and turning it back on him.  The widely read Herald Sun columnist and Sky News commentator used his significant platform to take aim at the 16-year-old campaigner, dismissing her followers as members of a cult and disparaging her decision to sail across the Atlantic in a high-speed racing yacht to attend UN climate summits in the US and Chile. “Thunberg has announced she’s finally going to the United States, the last bastion of the heathen, to preach the global warming faith to the Americans,” Bolt wrote. “Of course, she’s going by racing yacht, because she refuses to fly and heat the planet with an aeroplane’s global warming gasses.” I am indeed ”deeply disturbed” about the fact that these hate and conspiracy campaigns are allowed to go on and on and on just because we children communicate and act on the science. Where are the adults? pic.twitter.com/xDSlN0VgtZ The highly personal character assassination published in Rupert Murdoch’s tabloids repeatedly referred to Greta’s mental health, saying she was “deeply disturbed”, “freakishly influential” and “strange”. “I have never seen a girl so young and with so many mental disorders treated by so many adults as a guru,” Bolt wrote. “Far more interesting is why so many adults – including elected politicians, top business leaders, the Pope and journalists – treat a young and strange girl with such awe and even rapture. “Her intense fear of the climate is not surprising from someone with disorders which intensify fears.” Bolt even described Greta’s younger sister as having “a spectacular range of mental issues”. But the campaigner sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. The teenager, whose solo protest last year sparked the Fridays for Future global school climate strike movement, is taking a year off school to attend the summits, on 23 September in New York and 2-13 December in Santiago. Bolt said Greta was wrong on climate change because “the evidence does not suggest that humanity faces doom”.  B*lt goes for Greta & pathologises her. What a low blow. Must be feeling some relevance deprivation syndrome to attack a smart, articulate teen girl who is uniquely & effectively connecting with the masses on one of the big intergenerational matters for our times. But whatev. https://t.co/hICf4cwgqq The editor of the Herald Sun, Damon Johnston, did not respond to a request for comment. Attacks on the teenager are commonplace in the rightwing media. On the same day Bolt’s column appeared an anonymous column in the News Corp broadsheet the Australian referred to Greta as “the pig-tailed soothsayer”."

Below is a commentary addressing the YouTube response to the late October Breitbart headline that claimed the 400 papers (now 485) compiled here at NoTricksZone say that “Global Warming Is A Myth“.
While the headline at Breitbart was presumably assembled for the expressed purpose of attracting readership (mission accomplished, if so), it will be explicitly stated here that this compilation certainly does not assert that “Global Warming Is A Myth”.  It isn’t.  Large regions of the Earth have undergone a warming trend in the last century, rising out of the depths of the Little Ice Age.
It is also true that these papers are not claimed to literally “debunk” any positions currently held by those who advocate for the main “consensus” positions related to anthropogenic global warming.   Instead of using such ambitious and affirmative language, the nuanced words used to describe what this list is proposed to accomplish were carefully chosen so as not to assert it does more (or less) than actually claimed.
What the papers and graphs in this compilation actually do is support many of the main skeptical positions which question climate alarm.   Namely, they support the position(s):
N(1) natural mechanisms play well more than a negligible role (as claimed by the IPCC) in the net changes in the climate system, which includes temperature variations, precipitation patterns, weather events, etc., and the influence of increased CO2 concentrations on climatic changes are less pronounced than currently imagined;
N(2) the warming/sea levels/glacier and sea ice retreat/hurricane and drought intensities…experienced during the modern era are neither unprecedented or remarkable, nor do they fall outside the range of natural variability, as clearly shown in the first 150 graphs (from 2017) in this volume;
N(3) the computer climate models are not reliable or consistently accurate, and projections of future climate states are little more than speculation as the uncertainty and error ranges are enormous in a non-linear climate system; and
N(4) current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often ineffective and even harmful to the environment, whereas elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields).
In sharp contrast to the above, the corresponding “consensus” positions that these papers do not support are:
A(1) Close to or over 100% (110%) of the warming since 1950 has been caused by increases in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, leaving natural attribution at something close to 0%;
RealClimate.org: “The best estimate of the warming due to anthropogenic forcings (ANT) is the orange bar (noting the 1𝛔 uncertainties). Reading off the graph, it is 0.7±0.2ºC (5-95%) with the observed warming 0.65±0.06 (5-95%). The attribution then follows as having a mean of ~110%, with a 5-95% range of 80–130%. This easily justifies the IPCC claims of having a mean near 100%, and a very low likelihood of the attribution being less than 50% (p < 0.0001!).”
A(2) Modern warming, glacier and sea ice recession, sea level rise, drought and hurricane intensities…are all occurring at unprecedentedly high and rapid rates, and the effects are globally synchronous (not just regional)…and thus dangerous consequences to the global biosphere and human civilizations loom in the near future as a consequence of anthropogenic influences;
A(3) The climate models are reliable and accurate, and the scientific understanding of the effects of both natural forcing factors (solar activity, clouds, water vapor, etc.) and CO2 concentration changes on climate is “settled enough“, which means that “the time for debate has ended“;
A(4) The proposed solutions to mitigate the dangerous consequences described in N(4) – namely, wind and solar expansion – are safe, effective, and environmentally-friendly.
The 400+ papers compiled so far support the N(1)-N(4) positions, and they undermine or at least do not support the “consensus” A(1)-A(4) positions.  The papers do not do more than that.   Unreasonable expectations that these papers should do more than support skeptical positions and undermine “consensus” positions to “count” are rooted in straw man argumentation.
Specifically, claiming that a scientific paper must assert that CO2 does not play a major role in climate to be characterized as a paper supporting a skeptical positions in N(1)-N(4) is disingenuous at best.   The opposite wouldn’t ever stand, of course.   Let’s say an author of a scientific paper did not explicitly state that she disagrees that natural factors play a significant role in modern climate change.  Would that mean that we could say the paper affirms that climate changes are significantly natural?  Of course not.  And yet this very same non-sequitur is employed here with regularity when disingenuously arguing that these papers do not do what they claim to do – especially since what they are claimed to do has not been accurately characterized.
As an aside, if we were to look at the papers that Cook et al. (2013) used to concoct the 97% “consensus” document we would find that Cook and his colleagues actually classified papers (and magazine articles) about cooking stoves in Brazil, phone surveys, asthma-related ER visits in Montreal, TV coverage . . . as scientific papers “endorsing” the position that all or nearly all of the global warming occurring since 1950 has been human-caused (the “consensus” statement).  Of course, none of the papers identified in the link below that were categorized as “endorsing” the clearly defined anthropogenic/post-1950 “consensus” statement actually used those specific words.   And yet they were curiously counted anyway.
http://www.joseduarte.com/blog/cooking-stove-use-housing-associations-white-males-and-the-97
“The Cook et al. (2013) 97% paper included a bunch of psychology studies, marketing papers, and surveys of the general public as scientific endorsement of anthropogenic climate change.”
With that lengthy (but necessary) introduction, I will now take the time to carefully construct a response to the YouTube video critique of the 400+ papers list as authored by potholer54, who I shall hereafter refer to as PH54 for lack of a better title.

1. After having thoroughly criticized James Delingpole’s analysis and style for the first few minutes, PH54 digs in and correctly suggests that the NoTricksZone headline and emboldened first paragraph is more “nuanced” than Breitbart‘s.   He attempts to summarize what the 400+ papers represent by claiming they are meant to cast doubt on the conclusion that CO2 is a major driver of climate change — and no more.  Of course, as described above, there is far more to it than that, but soundbites are to be expected in short videos like this.

2. PH54 then, for reasons that are not clear, returns to using the Breitbart interface instead of using the NoTricksZone article and paper reference lists — which have far more detail and may include graphs that correspond to the paper.   Perhaps the reasons why will become apparent.

3. PH54 spends some time providing visuals of electric heaters warming an indoor room.   CO2 and the Sun are assumed to be just like two equally powerful heaters.   The Sun drives climate when the CO2 is stable, which it was during much of the Holocene.   Low solar activity causes cooling and high solar activity causes warming.   And in modern times, PH54 asserts, the Sun has been “turned down” just as the CO2 heater has been turned up.   So, during the modern era, CO2 drives climate.  The Sun used to drive warming and climate changes, but it no longer does.

4. Li et al. 2017 is the first paper directly discussed.  PH54 identifies what he calls the key words in the paper: Late Holocene.  He writes that the paper only addresses the last 2200 years, and it does not address the impacts of solar activity on modern climate.  He notes that solar forcing is not even mentioned in the title.   (CO2 isn’t either.)
PH54 then starts in on his main theme (as introduced in 2. above).  Yes, the Sun drives climate in the Late Holocene, and not CO2.   How do we know this?   Because CO2 was stable during the last 10,000 years – coasting between 250 ppm and 280 ppm.   So PH54 agrees, apparently, that the cold temperatures occurring during centennial-scale solar minima (Maunder, Dalton) would allow us to conclude that the Sun was a main driver of climate during those periods.  Likewise, the Medieval Maximum, a period of high solar activity, led to warm temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period, or Medieval Climate Anomaly (as it is preferred).

But it’s at that point – the Late Holocene – where the Sun apparently stops driving temperatures.   Why?  Because the CO2 heating machine took over.

5. But let’s get back to the Li et al. (2017) paper.  Now, because PH54 used the Breitbart article for a reference instead of the more detailed NoTricksZone visuals, he apparently missed the graphs shown below that appeared in the paper.  The top graph (red trend line) is a solar activity reconstruction for the last millennium.   Notice the sharp uptick in solar activity during the modern era.  This is referred to as the Modern Grand Maximum, with the levels of solar activity exceeding those occurring the Medieval Warm Period.  Now notice the bottom graph (gold).   It’s a graph of Northern Hemisphere temperatures.   Interestingly, there appears to be a very close correlation between the solar activity and the hemispheric temperature, including during the 20th century, when CO2 is said to have been the temperature driver.

Vieira et al., 2011


6. Another aspect of this Li et al. (2017) paper that was ostensibly missed by PH54 (apparently because he chose to use Breitbart‘s one- or two-sentence summary rather than NoTricksZone’s much more detailed summary complete with graphics) is the commentary about the impact of CO2 forcing relative to solar forcing.  The authors conclude that CO2 may play a role in “partly affecting climate variability” in North China, but that the overall long-term control on temperature is “solar-dominated.”
“High volumes of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 during the recent warming periods, may also play a role in partly affecting the climatic variability in NC, superimposing on the overall solar-dominated long-term control (e.g., Wanner et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2011; Kobashi et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015a,b).”

7. The Li et al. (2017) paper also contains a graph of North China that shows the modern temperatures (which have been flat since about 1950) are no warmer now than they were during Medieval times.  And, like the Northern Hemisphere in general, they appear to follow the general pattern of solar activity.  In other words, this paper supports both N(1) and N(2), and it does not support A(1) and A(2).   That’s why it was included on the list.

8.  Then, continuing the Holocene-only theme introduced in 2. and 4. above, PH54 addresses the second paper on the Breitbart list (again ignoring what is shown on NoTricksZone), Yndestad and Solheim (2017) .  He again claims these scientists were only talking about the Holocene in their paper, not the modern period.  He even includes a visual of the abstract with underlined red lines over the years 1000 AD and 1700 AD.  Had PH54 decided to read the rest of the paper – or even look at the NoTricksZone summary – he would have seen that the authors clearly referred to the modern period (multiple times), and they even referenced the coming solar minimum for the coming decades.  They especially made note of the millennial-scale uniqueness of the very high solar activity for the 1940 to 2000 period, referring to it as a rare event with levels exceeding all but the grand maximum events of 4,000 and 8,000 years ago.
“Deterministic models based on the stationary periods confirm the results through a close relation to known long solar minima since 1000 A.D. and suggest a modern maximum period from 1940 to 2015.  Studies that employ cosmogenic isotope data and sunspot data indicate that we are currently leaving a grand activity maximum, which began in approximately 1940 and is now declining (Usoskin et al., 2003; Solanki et al., 2004; Abreu et al., 2008). Because grand maxima  and minima occur on centennial or millennial timescales, they can only be investigated using proxy data, i.e., solar activity reconstructed from 10Be and 14C time-calibrated data. The conclusion is that the activity level of the Modern Maximum (1940–2000) is a relatively rare event, with the previous similarly high levels of solar activity observed 4 and 8 millennia ago (Usoskin et al., 2003).   Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods. Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods.”

9.  Here is the solar activity reconstruction featured prominently in the Yndestad and Solheim paper (and in NoTricksZone):

Notice how well solar activity correlates with reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature (Stoffel et al., 2015):


Schneider et al., 2015 also show an oscillation (warming-cooling-warming) in Northern Hemisphere temperatures for the 20th century.

Using 126 tree ring records, Xing et al. (2016) reconstruct Northern Hemisphere temperatures that follow trends in solar activity, as shown below.
The Extratropical Northern Hemisphere Temperature Reconstruction during the Last Millennium Based on a Novel Method (Xing et al., 2016)



10. Ignoring the Yndestad and Solheim TSI graph from the paper itself, which alternatively shows a net +3 W m-2 increase in solar forcing between 1900 and 2000, PH54 produced a graph showing declining sunspot numbers that did not appear in the Yndestad and Solheim paper.  Why not use the Yndestad and Solheim reconstruction?  Probably because it showed the opposite of what his graph of declining solar activity showed: That we have experienced a Modern Grand Maximum of solar activity, +3 W m-2 of forcing, since the beginning of the 20th century and continuing on through to about 2000.  It’s rather odd that the author of a video “exposing” that a paper doesn’t say what is claimed would proceed to refuse to actually read the paper itself (that references the modern period), or that he would avoid using the graph that was provided in the paper or by NoTricksZone.   Instead, PH54 chose to comment using a preferred graph of solar activity that supports his own viewpoints…and a summary provided by Breitbart.

11.  PH54 concludes: “[Yndestad and] Solheim doesn’t debunk the theory that CO2 is a major driver of climate.  It’s quite consistent with it.”
This is odd.  The authors don’t comment on CO2 as the “major driver of climate” in their paper.

12.  Then, after commenting on just those two papers (which were selected by James Delingpole), both of which suggest that solar activity has indeed contributed to modern climate in a significant way, PH54 states: “You get the point.  The highlighted papers just looking at past warming…when CO2 levels were stable.”
This is false.  While it’s true that many of the papers on the list do indeed only refer to past climates in asserting that solar activity drove centennial-scale temperature changes, there are also many that refer to the significant influence of solar activity on the modern climate, including the first two discussed by PH54.

13. PH54: “You can check the [Delingpole] list yourself.  It’s not that hard.  All you have to do is look at Delingpole’s summary.”
Delingpole only provided a handful of the examples from the papers.   The full list of 110 solar-influence papers, with more complete summaries and temperature graphs, are found on the NoTricksZone list.   It’s interesting that PH54 accuses Delingpole of not reading the papers himself, or relying on others to do the reading and summarizing for him…and then he goes ahead and relies on Delingpole for summaries of what the papers say.

14. PH54: Delingpole writes “Modern climate in phase with natural variability.  But the two papers he cites are talking about precipitation.”
Interestingly, PH54 has ostensibly decided that precipitation patterns are not sufficient to count as climate.  Apparently climate is about temperature, and temperature only.    Drought periodicity isn’t indicative of climate.   Decadal-scale flood events aren’t about climate.   Variability in the East Asian Monsoon and their connection to ENSO events don’t qualify as climate.   In ice cores, precipitation levels are often used as a proxy for temperature, with warmer/cooler temperatures corresponding to more/less precipitation.  How odd to take this stance.

15. PH54: “Neither paper [chosen by Delingpole] is talking about global temperature.”
Of course these two papers weren’t talking about global temperature.  The two papers selected from the compilation on natural variability were addressing regional rainfall patterns and their robust connections to solar activity.  Nor was it ever claimed that these two papers were talking about global temperature.   According to “consensus” science, though, drought and flood events and precipitation in general are expected to undergo significant shifts…due to changes in CO2 concentrations.
Miralles et al., 2014     “The hydrological cycle is expected to intensify in response to global warming. Yet, little unequivocal evidence of such an acceleration has been found on a global scale.”
These two papers, which do not support the A(2) “consensus” position, instead support the N(2) position that there is nothing unusual about the modern climate (precipitation) relative to past periods, when CO2 concentrations were much lower.

16. PH54: “During a period of La Nina, the Pacific ocean sucks in heat from the atmosphere, and during El Nino, it spits it back out.”
This is actually an incorrect way of putting it.  The heat for ENSO events isn’t sourced by atmospheric heat.  The heat source is from the ocean itself, and the ocean is heated by the Sun.  The atmosphere contains just 1% of the Earth system’s heat.  Therefore, the heat flux sequence is almost always from ocean to atmosphere, and not the other way around.  The heat redistribution during ENSO events are from the deeper waters to the ocean surface and vice versa.

17. PH54: “None of these papers [Delingpole selected] suggest CO2 is not a major driver of global temperature.”
This is the same non-sequitur referred to in the introduction.   Unless a paper expressly states that CO2 is not a major climate driver, it does not count as a paper supporting a skeptical position on climate alarm.  This does not follow.

18. PH54: “Further down the list, the papers get more bizarre.  Papers about bats being harmed by wind turbines and blade disposal.   I’m struggling to see how any of these papers are casting doubt on CO2’s role in global warming.”
The non-sequitur, repeated.   But this comment appears most disingenuous, as PH54 should probably understand that these particular papers addressing the harm to the environment and ineffectiveness of renewables-promoting policies were not selected from the literature to cast doubt on CO2’s role in climate change.   Instead – and one would assume that most readers would understand this – these papers were selected because they support the position that the “consensus”-endorsed response to the perspective that humans are the dominant cause dangerous global warming is to promote  wind and solar energies, and these may not be either effective or environmental friendly.
All PH54 needed to do was look at the introduction to the NoTricksZone article that addressed what these papers were designed to do, or to support.  These papers have nothing to do with CO2’s role in global warming.  They shouldn’t be expected to.
“Current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often costly, ineffective, and perhaps even harmful to the environment.  On the other hand, elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields).”

19. Addressing the Tejedor et al. (2017) paper, PH54 once again wrongly claims that the paper only addresses the past climate, and makes no reference to the current one.  Had he read the entire paper, or even the summary provided by NoTricksZone, he would (should) have noticed (since it is highlighted in bold red) that the paper does, in fact, mention the  high solar activity of the last few decades.  It also mentions that high solar activity is  associated with periods with high temperatures, such as the warming occurring during 1986-2012.
“Reconstructed long-term temperature variations match reasonably well with solar irradiance changes since warm and cold phases correspond with high and low solar activity, respectively. … The main driver of the large-scale character of the warm and cold episodes may be changes in the solar activity. The beginning of the reconstruction starts with the end of the Spörer minimum. The Maunder minimum, from 1645 to 1715 (Luterbacher et al., 2001) seems to be consistent with a cold period from 1645 to 1706. In addition, the Dalton minimum from 1796 to 1830 is detected for the period 1810 to 1838. However, a considerably cold period from 1778 to 1798 is not in agreement with a decrease in the solar activity. Four warm periods – 1626–1637, 1800–1809, 1845– 1859, and 1986–2012 – have been identified to correspond to increased solar activity.”
Then, after asserting the paper fails to address the modern era, PH54 highlights (using red underlining) the mention of “anthropogenic forces” in the paper.  Curiously, he claims that this particular sentence, as it reads, asserts that CO2 is a “major driver” of climate change.
“The study area [is] a potentially vulnerable region to anthropogenic climatic changes by anthropogenic forces, i.e,., increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases.”
But if this one rather mild sentence from the paper supports the position that CO2 is a major driver of climatic changes (and perhaps it does), then surely one can agree that the statement asserting the “main driver” of “warm periods” may be increases in solar activity (and the 1986-2012 period is specifically referred to in the paper as a warm period that “corresponds to increased solar activity”) could also be interpreted as support for the position that the Sun has more than a negligible role in modern temperatures for the region.

20.  The NoTricksZone compilation contains two graphs from the Tejedor et al. (2017) paper, both of which would appear to support the N(1) position that the modern climate has been impacted by the high solar activity (notice how the warming and cooling events match up rather fittingly with solar activity)…

…and that there is nothing unusual or unprecedented about modern temperatures in the Iberian region to suggest that they have fallen outside the range of natural variability, an N(2) position.

21. Interestingly, the Rydval et al. (2017) paper contains several graphs from the Northern Hemisphere, all of which correspond quite well to the changes in solar activity, including the Medieval Maximum and Modern Grand Maximum.   They generally show no net warming since the middle of the 20th century due to a severe cooling period between the 1940s and 1960s (wiping out much of the early 20th century warming), which is consistent with the pattern of solar activity shown earlier.




22. The strongest part of the video response is the section citing 4 or 5 other papers that, in addition to concluding that the Sun plays a role in climate changes, also conclude that CO2 concentrations play an important role too.  Some of the identified papers even say that CO2 plays a larger role than natural factors do.   While this may appear to fully destroy the position that these papers “debunk” global warming as a myth — a claim which has not been made here — these statements still do not seem to assert that the only, 100% cause of climate changes since 1950 is anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  Indeed, even as they claim a significant role for CO2, they do not dismiss natural factors as having any role in climate changes.  This is, after all, the “consensus” position as espoused by the IPCC.   To support the consensus, then, there should be effectively no role for natural factors in climate change after 1950.  Papers that allow natural factors to at least contribute some to the climatic changes would therefore not be supporting the “consensus”.   That is why papers like these may still be included, despite the apparent inconsistency.

23. Williams et al. (2017) assert that temperatures warmed more and warmed faster (1.1°C, 0.008°C per year) from the 1660s to the 1800s — when CO2 did not change — than they did during the 1860 to 2007 period (0.8°C, 0.005°C per year).  This would not be consistent with the perspective that CO2 emissions are a more dominant climate forcing factor than the non-CO2 factors eliciting temperatures changes during the 17th to 19th centuries.   It undermines the A(2) position, and it would be consistent with N(2).  Also, while Williams et al. (2017) do state that global temperatures “are exceeding estimates of natural variability”, this is not remotely the same thing as concluding that natural factors do not play a role in climate changes after 1950.  Indeed, the opposite is said: natural factors are included as factors playing a role in climate changes “for the last 342 years.”
“Reconstructed SSTs significantly warmed 1.1 ± 0.30°C … from 1660s to 1800 (rate of change: 0.008 ± 0.002°C/year), followed by a significant cooling of 0.8 ± 0.04°C …  until 1840 (rate of change: 0.02 ± 0.001°C/year), then a significant warming of 0.8 ± 0.16°C from 1860 until the end of reconstruction in 2007 (rate of change: 0.005 ± 0.001°C/year).”
“[T]hese data suggest a complex combination of solar irradiance, volcanic activity, internal ocean dynamics and external anthropogenic forcing explain the variability in Aleutian SSTs for the past 342 years.”

24.  Zawiska et al. (2017) write that human emissions of CO2 are “considered” to be “the most important factor” in modern climate change.  They do not conclude that CO2 emissions are effectively the only factor.   Furthermore, they conclude that profound temperature changes for the region occurred far more abruptly between 1800 and 1875 than they have since, when the temperature changes have been slower and largely flat for the past 100 years (despite rising CO2 emissions).  The abrupt warming event — 4.3°C within 75 years — for the region was said to be forced by “increased solar activity“ and the NAO.  Again, this would appear to support the significant role of natural factors in climate changes, and less so the anthropogenic influence, thus supporting both N(1) and N(2).   In the graph, notice how closely temperatures correspond to increases and decreases in solar activity.
“The temperature reconstruction from Lake Atnsjøen indicates that recent and ongoing climate warming began already in 1800 CE following the LIA. Temperatures increased very fast, from 8.5 to 12.8 °C during the first 75 years [1800-1875], but in the 20th century the increase became less pronounced.”


25.  Abrantes et al. (2017), refer to the Modern Grand Maximum (1940-2000) of very high solar activity, and, like the other authors above, suggest solar activity is a driver of cooling and warming events.
“The coldest SSTs are detected between 1350 and 1850 CE, on Iberia during the well-known Little Ice Age (LIA) (Bradley and Jones, 1993), with the most intense cooling episodes related with other solar minima events, and major volcanic forcing and separated by intervals of relative warmth (e.g. (Crowley and Unterman, 2013; Solanki et al., 2004; Steinhilber et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2016; Usoskin et al., 2011). During the 20th century, the southern records show unusually large decadal scale SST oscillations in the context of the last 2 millennia, in particular after the mid 1970’s, within the Great Solar Maximum (1940 – 2000 (Usoskin et al., 2011))”
It would not appear that Abrantes et al. (2017) are dismissing solar activity as having any role at all in climate changes, which is what the “consensus” asserts.
Also, this paper provides multiple reconstructions from the region and for the entire Northern Hemisphere that would support N(2), and would not support A(2), as they show that modern temperatures do not fall outside the range of natural variability.   All three graphs below even show a cooling trend beginning in the late 20th century, which would appear to be inconsistent with the perspective that CO2 changes are driving climate synchronously on a global scale.   Most of the modern warming is shown to have occurred during the first half of the 20th century, when CO2 emissions were but a fraction of what they were after 1950.  Again, this would not be consistent with the perspective that CO2 is driving up post-1950 temperatures at an unprecedented rate.


 

26.  Wang et al. (2017) characterize the impact of GHGs on the regional signal for the last 1000 years as a “reasonable speculation”.   “Reasonable speculation” that the millennial-scale changes may have been affected by GHGs would not appear to be a ringing endorsement.  Furthermore, millennial-scale changes would appear to be distinct from the changes after 1950, as human emissions could not have been driving climate on that timescale.    The authors also agree that their findings are consistent with Dr. Scafetta’s work, a scientist who has taken the position that the Sun has played a major role in climate changes, including during the modern era.
“The driving forces of climate change were investigated and the results showed two independent degrees of freedom —a 3.36-year cycle and a 22.6-year cycle, which seem to be connected to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation cycle and the Hale sunspot cycle, respectively. … Solar variability has been shown to be a major driver of climate in central Europe during the past two millennia using Δ14C records. Furthermore, this result is essentially in good agreement with the findings of Scafetta e.g. refs 17, 18, 19, who found that the climate system was mostly characterized by a specific set of oscillations and these oscillations (61, 115, 130 and 983 years) appeared to be synchronous with major astronomical oscillations (solar system, solar activity and long solar/lunar tidal cycles).”
27. Other than natural vs. anthropogenic attribution for warming temperatures, PH54 does not address any of the other positions detailed in the 400+ papers compilation…other than to poke fun at the bat extinction and turbine waste issues.  The papers asserting the inadequacies of the models go unaddressed, as do the papers on the cryosphere, cloud variations and surface solar radiation.  The much higher temperatures and sea levels of years past, when CO2 concentrations were in the “safe” range, would appear to be a topic with some cogency when discussing global-scale warming.   None of the ~140  papers on the 2nd list were even touched on.
Apparently it is believed that all that is needed to “debunk” a compilation such as this is to point out that only a handful of the papers (Smirnov, 2017, Hertzberg et al., 2017, Kramm et al., 2017, Nikolov and Zeller, 2017, Harde, 2017, Lightfoot and Mamer, 2017. Blaauw, 2017,  Allmendinger, 2017, Abbot and Marohasy, 2017 ) explicitly denounce anthropogenic CO2 as a main climate driver.
I disagree…for reasons that are nuanced.

04.11.17 Update 
A Response To potholer54’s Response

A commenter here has brought to my attention that potholer54 (for brevity, I will continue using PH54) has replied to my response to his rather underwhelming YouTube critique of our list of 400+ papers (which will likely reach 500 by year’s end).
Apparently PH54 still is under the impression that he has (a) correctly interpreted what the papers say about CO2 emissions as the main climate driver (even though many don’t even mention CO2 or anthropogenic influences), and (b) he doesn’t have to address what the bulk of the papers and graphs are supporting: that there is nothing unusual or remarkable about modern day climate changes (temperatures, glacier melt, sea level rise, weather events, precipitation patterns, etc.), and thus many of the modeled expectations that indicate there should be a clearly recognizable anthropogenic signal in the above parameters have been thoroughly undermined.   I’ll address both points here.
PH54 writes: “Richards shows quite neatly in his rebuttal that they [the papers] don’t even say what Richards himself claims they say.”
Obvioiusly I will need to again address PH54’s claim that he has correctly interpreted what the papers say.  We’ll start with his claim that Yndestad and Solheim (2017) have only referred to the Holocene in their paper.  (In the video, he underlines in red the years 1000 A.D. and 1700 A.D. found in the abstract so as to support this contention.)  PH54  claims these scientists do not refer to the current era.  To support his claim that Yndestad and Solheim were only referring to the Holocene, PH54 decided to omit or ignore the part of the abstract where it says:
Deterministic models based on the stationary periods confirm the results through a close relation to known long solar minima since 1000 A.D. and suggest a modern maximum period from 1940 to 2015. The model computes a new Dalton-type sunspot minimum from approximately 2025 to 2050 and a new Dalton-type period TSI minimum from approximately 2040 to
2065.
So the authors not only refer to the 20th and 21st century in the paper’s abstract, they forecast a solar minimum and cooler temperatures for the coming decades.   Nowhere in the paper are there references made to CO2 or anthropogenic influences on climate, as PH54 falsely contends.  Furthermore, one of the scientists’ main points is that the very high solar activity that we have enjoyed in recent decades is only now declining.   The Modern Grand Maximum did not begin to decline in the 1950s, as claimed, but only after the year 2000.  In fact, the year 2000 is characterized as the peak of the current grand maximum.
“[T]he activity level of the Modern Maximum (1940–2000) is a relatively rare event, with the previous similarly high levels of solar activity observed 4 and 8 millennia ago (Usoskin et al., 2003). … A cold period was also observed during the time of the Dalton minimum. The Maunder and the Dalton minima are associated with less solar activity and colder climate periods. …  Studies that employ cosmogenic isotope data and sunspot data indicate that we are currently leaving a grand activity maximum, which began in approximately 1940 and is now declining (Usoskin et al., 2003; Solanki et al., 2004; Abreu et al., 2008).  … A visual inspection of the TSI wavelet spectrum reveals the dominant periods in the TSI data series in the time window between 1700 and 2013. The long wavelet period has a maximum in 1760, 1840, 1930, and 2000, with a mean gap of approximately 80 years”
Not only this, but contrary to PH54’s claims that Yndestad and Solheim do not connect solar activity to modern-day temperatures, these scientists indicate that the Hoyt-Schatten/Scafetta-Wilson TSI reconstruction shows  a “strong correlation“ with Northern Hemisphere temperatures extending from 1880 to 2013, citing the work of Soon et al. (2015) in affirming a “a strong solar influence on the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere“.
“Periods with few sunspots are associated with low solar activity and cold climate periods. Periods with many sunspots are associated with high solar activity and warm climate periods.  … The Hoyt-Schatten irradiance model has been calibrated and extended with the newest version of ACRIM TSI observations (e.g. Scafetta and Willson, 2014, Fig. 16); it is employed in this analysis. In the following section, this reconstruction is referred to as TSI HS. A mostly rural Northern Hemisphere composite temperature series 1880–2013 shows strong correlation with the TSI-HS reconstruction, which indicates a strong solar influence on the temperature of the Northern Hemisphere (Soon et al., 2015).”

It should be noted that Soon et al. (2015) found a very strong correlation between solar activity and Northern Hemisphere rural temperatures since 1880 – as the rural instrumental data are less affected by artificial or non-climatic warming.
“Finally, we compare our new composite to one of the solar variability datasets not considered by the CMIP5 climate models, i.e., Scafetta & Willson, 2014’s update to the Hoyt & Schatten, 1993 dataset. A strong correlation is found between these two datasets, implying that solar variability has been the dominant influence on Northern Hemisphere temperature trends since at least 1881.”


PH54 writes:
“The first paper Richards cites in his rebuttal – a paper by Li et al. – is itself a good example of this.  Citing that paper, Richards concludes: “There appears to be a very close correlation between the solar activity and the hemispheric temperature, including during the 20th century, when CO2 is said to have been the temperature driver.  “There APPEARS to be” means this is what Richards thinks – it is not the conclusion of the paper.”

PH54 also once again claims that Li et al. (2017) support his claim that CO2 emissions from humans are what have driven temperature increases for the region since about 1950, and that solar activity has not driven the temperature increase.  But, as mentioned above, the authors cite a graph of temperatures for North China that, yet again, does not show any net warming since about 1940.   While this is somewhat problematic in supporting the contention that CO2 has driven the warming trend there, the authors also point out that the increase in greenhouse gases may “partly” play a role in the variability during “the recent warming periods”, but that partial role in influencing variability is only superimposed on the solar-dominated control.   Once again, this would not appear to support PH54’s claim that Li et al. (2017) endorse the position that CO2 increases are the main, close-to-100% control on temperature changes for the region during the “recent warming periods”.
“[H]igh volumes of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 during the recent warming periods, may also play a role in partly affecting the climatic variability in NC, superimposing on the overall solar-dominated long-term control (e.g., Wanner et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2011; Kobashi et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2015a,b).”
“[T]he 103, 50, and 22 year periods for TANN [annual temperatures] correlate well with the 100, 50, 23 and 22 year cycles for the solar activity observed in various solar parameters (e.g., Wilson et al., 1996; Li et al., 1996; Chowdhury et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014), therefore implying an in-phase relationship between the climatic oscillation in NC [North China] and solar activity.”

PH54: “The reason Richards got it wrong is that he was trying to discern solar fluctuations over the last 50 years in a graph that spans 1,000 years, so the curves over that narrow period are very small and indistinct. Perhaps Richards wasn’t wearing his glasses.”
As shown in the initial response above, several other reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature show strong consistencies with trends in solar activity.  The above criticism assessing an inability to discern solar fluctuations would not appear to be valid here.

Stoffel et al., 2015


Christiansen and Lungqvist (2012)


But these graphs, and the main problem with PH54’s analysis in general, is that he thinks that by directly referencing a grand total of 9 papers in his video, he has comprehensively assessed and correctly interpreted the entire volume of 400+ papers accurately, and that they all affirm his presuppositions that in about 1950 CO2 emissions became the dominant cause of climate change, and the natural factors that used to be the dominant causes of climate change figuratively took a backseat.  That’s why he curiously writes, without obviously having even read even close to “many” of these papers, that:
PH54: “Many of the 400 papers explicitly ENDORSE the conclusion that CO2 is a powerful greenhoue gas.”   
Of course, this claim is an assumption, not rooted in actual analysis of the 400+ papers.  It’s also an example of how the definition of what is necessary to affirm an endorsement of the “consensus” changes mercurially to fit the presupposition.  Now all that’s needed to affirm that these papers are invalid as evidence supporting a skeptical position on climate alarm is that an author need only write (explicitly) that CO2 is a “powerful greenhouse gas.”   PH54 claims that there are “many” such papers here…after having “analyzed” about 9 of them.  Of course, whether or not CO2 is a “powerful greenhouse gas” — interestingly, water vapor is also a “powerful greenhouse gas” — is not even the question being affirmed or questioned here.  It’s just moving the pea.

The question is this: To what extent, or how much, are trends in weather extremes, surface temperatures, ocean heat content, glacier melt, sea level rise, floods, droughts, etc., influenced by parts per million (0.000001) changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and human emissions vs. the extent to which identifiable trends vary naturally, or without anthropogenic influence?
The “consensus” position, as endorsed by the IPCC, is that close to 100% of the climate change that has occurred since 1950 is human caused.
If that’s the case, then human-caused climate change doesn’t look much different than the one produced by natural variations.  The changes in modern climate indices are so negligible, so trivial, that finding an anthropogenic signal amid the noise of natural variability is quite difficult.   That’s what most of these papers say.  And that’s exactly what PH54 writes nothing about in his “critique” of our list.
And yet PH54 apparently thinks that all he must do is claim that “many” of the papers support (actually, “explicitly ENDORSE”) the position that CO2 is a “powerful greenhouse gas”, and, just like that, the 400+ papers will . . . go away.
No, that’s just not how it works.
The following are just a tiny fraction of the papers from 2017 supporting a skeptical position on climate alarm . . . that PH54 never even bothered to read.

350 Non-Hockey Stick Graphs, With The First ~120 From 2017
• There has been no detectable long-term acceleration in sea level rise (Parker and Ollier, 2017), and sea levels may only be rising between 0.25 and 1.04 mm/year.
“[L]ocal sea-level forecasts should be based on proven local sea-level data. Their naïve averaging of all the tide gauges included in the PSMSL surveys showed ‘‘relative’’ trends of about + 1.04 mm/year (570 tide gauges of any length). By only considering the 100 tide gauges with more than 80 years of recording, the average trend was only + 0.25 mm/year [2.5 centimeters per century].”
“….does not support the notion of rapidly changing mass of ice in Greenland and Antarctica“
“loud divergence between sea level reality” and “the climate models [that] predict an accelerated sea-level rise driven by the anthropogenic CO2 emission.”

• The melting of the Greenland ice sheet that could possibly be attributed to humans is still “too small to be detected”. (Haine, 2016, Orsi et al., 2017)
“Notably, the three studies [Jackson et al., 2016;  Böning et al., 2016; Robson et al., 2016] report an absence of anthropogenic effects on the AMOC, at least so far: the directly observed AMOC weakening since 2004 is not consistent with the hypothesis that anthropogenic aerosols have affected North Atlantic ocean temperatures. The midlatitude North Atlantic temperature changes since 2005 have greater magnitude and opposite sign (cooling) than those attributed to ocean uptake of anthropogenic heat. The anthropogenic melt from the Greenland ice sheet is still too small to be detected.
“The recent warming trend in North Greenland  … We find that δ 18O [temperature/climate proxy] has been increasing over the past 30 years, and that the decade 1996-2005 is the second highest decade in the 287-year record. The highest δ 18O [temperature/climate proxy] values were found in 1928, which is also an extreme year in GISP2 and NGRIP ice cores, and in a coastal South Greenland composite (Vinther et al., 2006; Masson-Delmotte et al., 2015), but the decadal average (1926-1935) is not statistically different from the decade (2002-2011). … The surface warming trend has been principally attributed to sea ice retreat and associated heat fluxes from theocean (Serreze et al., 2009; Screen and Simmonds, 2010a, b), to a negative trend in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) since 1990, increasing warm air advection on the West Coast of Greenland and Eastern Canada (Hanna et al., 2012; Fettweis et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2014), and to an increase in the Greenland Blocking Index [Hanna et al., 2013]. These latter mechanisms could be dominated by natural variability rather than forced response to the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gases (Fettweis et al., 2013; Screen et al., 2014).”
• The Greenland ice sheet (GIS) has been melting so slowly and so negligibly in recent decades that the entire ice sheet’s total contribution to global sea level rise was a mere 0.39 of a centimeter (0.17 to 0.61 cm) between 1993 and 2010 (Leeson et al, 2017).
• The Western Antarctic Peninsula has been rapidly cooling since 1999 (-0.47°C per decade), reversing the previous warming trend and leading to “a shift to surface mass gains of the peripheral glacier” (Oliva et al., 2017).
• Since 1800, the Surface Mass Balance for the entire Antarctic Ice Sheet has increased.  (Thomas et al., 2017).
“Our study suggests an overall increase in SMB [surface mass balance] across the grounded Antarctic ice sheet of ~ 44 GT since 1800 AD, with the largest (area-weighted) contribution from the Antarctic Peninsula (AP).”
• There has been no continent-scale warming trend for Antarctica since CO2 emissions began rising. (Stenni et al., 2017)
“[N]o continent-scale warming of Antarctic temperature is evident in the last century.”

• According to Fettweis et al. (2017), the Greenland ice sheet contributed a grand total of 1.5 centimeters of sea level rise between the years 1900 and 2010, with most of that contribution coming prior to 1940 (since there was no contribution at all between 1940 and 2000). The ice sheet gained mass between 1961 and 1990, or during the same period of time that CO2 emissions were skyrocketing.
“The period 1961–1990 has been considered as a period when the total mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet was stable (Rignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006) and near zero. However, at the last century scale, all MAR reconstructions suggest that SMB [surface mass balance] was particularly positive during this period [1961-1990] (SMB was most positive from the 1970s to the middle of the 1990s), suggesting that mass gain may well have occurred during this period, in agreement with results from Colgan et al. (2015). … Finally, with respect to the 1961–1990 period, the integrated contribution of the GrIS SMB anomalies over 1900–2010 is a sea level rise of about 15 ± 5 mm [1.5 cm], with a null contribution from the 1940s to the 2000s”
• Greenland is currently about 3 degrees C colder than it was just a few thousand years ago (Kobashi et al., 2017).

“Greenland temperature reached the Holocene thermal maximum with the warmest decades occurring during the Holocene (2.9 ± 1.4 °C warmer than the recent decades [1988-2015]) at 7960 ± 30 years B.P.”
• The Greenland ice sheet has been cooling (slightly) since 2005 (Kobashi et al., 2017).

“For the most recent 10 years (2005 to 2015), apart from the anomalously warm year of 2010, mean annual temperatures at the Summit exhibit a slightly decreasing trend in accordance with northern North Atlantic-wide cooling.”
• The Southern Ocean has been cooling since 1979 (Turney et al., 2017, Kusahara et al., 2017).
“Occupying about 14% of the world’s surface, the Southern Ocean plays a fundamental role in ocean and atmosphere circulation, carbon cycling and Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics. … As a result of anomalies in the overlying wind, the surrounding waters are strongly influenced by variations in northward Ekman transport of cold fresh subantarctic surface water and anomalous fluxes of sensible and latent heat at the atmosphere–ocean interface. This has produced a cooling trend since 1979.”

“Concomitant with this positive trend in Antarctic sea ice, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the Southern Ocean south of approximately 45°S have cooled over this period [since 1979].”
• Sea ice for the entire Southern Hemisphere has been growing, defying climate models (Comiso et al., 2017).
“The Antarctic sea ice extent has been slowly increasing contrary to expected trends due to global warming and results from coupled climate models.”

• Sea ice for the Northern Hemisphere has undergone an oscillation in the last 80 years, consistent with temperature trends for all of the Arctic (Connolly et al., 2017, Hanhijärvi et al., 2013).
“According to this new dataset, the recent period of Arctic sea ice retreat since the 1970s followed a period of sea ice growth after the mid 1940s, which in turn followed a period of sea ice retreat after the 1910s. Our reconstructions agree with previous studies that have noted a general decrease in Arctic sea ice extent (for all four seasons) since the start of the satellite era (1979). However, the timing of the start of the satellite era is unfortunate in that it coincided with the end of several decades during which Arctic sea ice extent was generally increasing. This late-1970s reversal in sea ice trends was not captured by the hindcasts of the recent CMIP5 climate models used for the latest IPCC reports, which suggests that current climate models are still quite poor at modelling past sea ice trends.”

•The North Atlantic has been rapidly cooling since 2005 (Piecuch et al., 2017)
“The subpolar North Atlantic (SPNA) is subject to strong decadal variability, with implications for surface climate and its predictability. In 2004–2005, SPNA decadal upper ocean and sea-surface temperature trends reversed from warming during 1994–2004 to cooling over 2005–2015.”

"Millions of Americans don’t know who John Delaney or John Hickenlooper are. They probably wouldn’t be able to correctly identify them in a photo. And yet, at the Democratic debate on Tuesday night, Delaney got to speak for nearly 11 minutes, and John Hickenlooper for almost nine. In one night, those two relatively unknown men combined got more airtime than the climate crisis has in all three debates thus far. And that’s despite the fact that, if we don’t do anything to address rising temperatures now, we will see several US cities underwater in the coming decades. So here’s my pitch: if these and other candidates without a shot in hell at winning actually cared about the future of this country, they would drop out.  There are plenty of substantive differences among the viable candidates that deserve to be explored in depth, on just about every issue raised at Tuesday’s debate – healthcare, immigration, climate, gun violence – plus many more. And while it’s great for the ratings of networks like CNN, it’s not exactly a boon to American democracy to watch a stage flanked with unrecognizable C-list primary hopefuls pad their own egos because they’re rich or well-connected enough to meet the debate criteria. That’s not to say that there isn’t a case to be made for long-shot candidates. Though Jay Inslee is unlikely to get the nomination, his detailed climate policy releases are invaluable resources for any future administration and set a high standard for other candidates on an issue that growing numbers of Americans are deeply concerned about. And I’m one of many that would love to see the Alaska senator-turned-internet-phenomenon Mike Gravel appear on stage and give voice to the millions of teens who are unable to vote. The DNC shouldn’t limit the field with stricter criteria to keep them out. But Delaney and other visionless outliers should have the humility to know that they’re adding next to nothing to the conversation besides hot air. And moderators should have the good sense not to let them drone on, let alone pivot whole debate topics around them. Consider the start of Tuesday night’s all-too-brief exchange on climate. In one of a long string of questions that might as well have been crafted by a Republican strategist, the moderator Jake Tapper asked Delaney what he thinks is unrealistic about the Green New Deal, a policy framework that most frontrunners, besides Joe Biden, have endorsed. The result was an extended detour into his half-baked plan for a bipartisan carbon tax and experimental technologies. You wouldn’t be wrong to say my frustration with Delaney and his ilk is a little misplaced; please forgive the weariness of a politics writer staring down the barrel of another 16 months of the horse race. But if progressives like me are angry with people like Delaney and Hickenlooper – who hold close ties to the healthcare and mining industry, respectively – it’s because they and their friends already enjoy such outsized influence over our political system. It’s thanks in no small part to the lobbying of the healthcare industry Delaney defended in the debate that America’s healthcare system is as broken as it is, and why this country hasn’t managed to catch up with other wealthy nations in providing care to everyone who needs it. It’s thanks to Hickenlooper’s buddies in the oil and gas sector that we’re only now even starting to have a serious conversation about what it will look like to curb climate breakdown at the scale that challenge deserves. It’s also for those reasons that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren’s gloves-off approach to these problems and the millionaires driving them is so appealing, to young Democrats especially. We’ve heard enough from elites dipping their toes into politics when it suits them. Instead, we want candidates who will call the one per cent’s influence over our politics and economy what it is: absurd, undemocratic and even – as Sanders said of the fossil fuel industry tonight – criminal.

"The Morrison government’s main climate change policy, the emissions reduction fund, has been labelled “a joke” after its latest auction bought cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution. While the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced prior to the election that the policy would get an additional $2bn funding, the first post-election auction from the fund dedicated less than $1m to just three emissions reduction projects. Combined, the three projects are promised to cut emissions by 59,000 tonnes over a decade – just 0.06% of the 100m-tonne cut Morrison said the rebadged “climate solutions” fund would deliver as part of a government plan to meet the target set at the Paris climate summit. It will reinforce the expert view that Australia will not meet its Paris commitment under current policy settings. Australia’s emissions have risen each year since the Coalition replaced a carbon price scheme with the emissions reduction fund. The result is the worst of nine auctions using the fund, under which landowners and businesses bid for taxpayers’ support for projects to reduce emissions at lowest cost. The Clean Energy Regulator, the government agency that runs the fund, said the auction marked an important milestone “as the carbon market gears up”. The three contracts it signed will cost $840,000, at an average of $14.17 a tonne of carbon dioxide reduction. Richie Merzian, from progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said the result “looked like a joke”. “This is the central mechanism for reducing Australia’s emissions and it purchases a minuscule amount. What’s the point of topping it up with $2bn?” he said. “The only thing the climate solutions fund solved was the government’s re-election. It sure won’t solve Australia’s rising emissions with this miserly effort.” The minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, said across nine auctions the government had signed contracts for 780 projects that would deliver 192m tonnes in cuts over a decade. He suggested the result of the latest auction, held on 24 and 25 July, was affected by Labor promising to abolish the fund if it won power at the election. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the fund “was never anything but a fig leaf”. “This shows Scott Morrison and the Liberals have a disastrous climate change policy,” he said. The Carbon Market Institute, representing businesses holding contracts for 70% of the emissions cuts contracted under the fund, said the auction result highlighted the need to reboot Australia’s climate policies. The institute’s chief executive, John Connor, said it was a “surprisingly small” result even after factoring in uncertainties about the fund’s operation and an expectation that Labor would win the election and change national climate policy. He said the government was trying to improve and expand the fund but it should create a better carbon market by strengthening the “safeguard mechanism”, which was promised to limit emissions from big industry but under which companies have largely been allowed to nominate their own pollution level, leading to increases. In a statement, the Clean Energy Regulator said it had rejected several bids of more than $15 a tonne of emissions reduction as they were not considered “value for money in the current environment”. Bret Harper, the director of research at analyst firm RepuTex, said the regulator had faced a choice: to either pay more per tonne of carbon dioxide and make deeper cuts, or to maintain the current price. He said it should have paid more. “The price point is wrong,” Harper said. “At this rate they are in danger of having more abatement cancelled [through contracts from earlier auction rounds not being fulfilled] than they are contracting.” Taxpayers have so far paid out $564m and committed another $1.74bn, with $237m of historic funding yet to be spent. In February, Morrison promised an additional $2bn funding over 10 years, but that was stretched to 15 years in the pre-election budget. Just $149m has been allocated over the next four years. A Guardian investigation last year found while projects supported by the fund have merit, particularly those that restore native vegetation, it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere. The government says it will cut emissions by 26-28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The independent Climate Change Authority recommended Australia should make a cut of 45% to 63% over this period. David Parker, the regulator’s chairman, said the agency looked “forward to working closely with participants and industry to explore new and innovative ways to implement the climate solutions fund”."

‘Greenhouse’ Difference Between CO2 And Air
 
Below is a very abridged quoted summary of a new scientific paper published by Dr. Thomas Allmendinger, a physicist (chemistry, quantum mechanics) who uses a real-world experiment to document a glaring lack of empirical support for the position that CO2 is a dominant agent of atmospheric warming.
One-sentence summary: Shortwave radiation heats both CO2 and air only up to a limited temperature threshold, and there is no observed difference between the heat absorption/emission of  air vs. CO2.  


Dr. Thomas Allmendinger (2017)
Original Greenhouse Theory Not Backed By Experimental Data
The starting point of the here referenced research was the generally accepted greenhouse thesis which assumes that the present climate change is mainly due to the observed growing amount of the so-called greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly of carbon-dioxide in spite of the fact that, unlike a greenhouse, the Earth atmosphere doesn’t exhibit a transparent roof …  This [greenhouse effect] idea takes its source in Fourier’s treatise made in 1827, exhibiting no empirical data or physical calculations and experimental data.
The first results were delivered by Tyndall in the sixties of the 19th century, using artificial IR (= infrared) radiation. His photometric [light-measuring] apparatus consisted of metallic tubes as gas vessels and Leslie cubes as heat radiation sources, entailing comparatively low temperatures, namely 100°C and lower. In the [eighteen] nineties, Arrhenius continued such measurements. He established the greenhouse thesis claiming that, unlike air, carbon-dioxide considerably absorbs infrared-radiation. Thereby we distinguish between near IR (λ = 0.8 – 3μm), emitted at high temperatures (> 1000 K), and medium IR (λ = 3 – 50μm) occurring at lower temperatures as usual thermal radiation, while IR-radiation with larger wavelengths (λ = 50 – 1000μm) is defined as far IR.
[O]verall, the greenhouse thesis has been commonly settled even if […] its empiric basis appears poor while several theoretical presumptions are speculative.  … there is reason enough to examine the current climate theory, and in particular the greenhouse thesis, regarding fundamental scientific principles and possibly to question the usual assumptions.
The analytic methods applied in climatology were exclusively photometric [light-measuring] ones. … Thermal measurements have never been made, except those by pyranometers comprising the whole spectrum, so that direct coherences between light absorption and warming-up effects at matter have not been detected yet.
The natural laws which were used for constructing the theory were confined to the temperature law of Stefan-Boltzmann (1), Planck’s distribution law (2), both being solely valid for black bodies, and BeerLambert’s absorption law (3), being unequivocally valid solely for visible light, and not compellingly for IR radiation (see below). These laws were often impermissibly generalized and used in an incorrect way leading to wrong conclusions.
Questioning The CO2-IR-Warms-The-Atmosphere Assumption
[A]ccording to this [greenhouse theory] model the assumption is made that any warming-up of the atmosphere is exclusively due to a partial absorption of medium-wave IR-radiation while any short-wave IR-absorption can be excluded since it has never been detected spectrometrically.
Against this, at least the following [5] arguments may be alleged [just the 1st , 4th, and 5th arguments are included here in very condensed form]:
1. As already found within a previous investigation [12], the greater part – namely at least 60% – of the energy being emitted from a warmed plate to the surrounding atmosphere is transferred by heat conduction, and not by heat radiation [i.e., via the greenhouse effect] obeying Stefan-Boltzmann’s law which is only valid in the vacuum. That part is even enhanced when the air convection is enhanced. Moreover, near the ground the molar concentration of water vapour is much higher than that one of carbon dioxide letting assume that its absorbance of heat radiation is much stronger. (e.g. at 20°C and 60% rel. humidity, the molar concentration of water vapour is 36 times larger than that one of carbon-dioxide being 0.038 volume%). Hence it can be assumed that the major part of the heat transfer between Earth surface and atmosphere occurs near the ground while the greenhouse theory neglects that part solely regarding the radiative absorption by CO2 passing the whole atmosphere.
4. Between the energetic absorption of electromagnetic radiation by gases and their resulting warming-up no empirical – and also no
theoretical – coherence is known which would be needed to carry spectroscopic results onto thermodynamic properties. There is no good reason to assume that absorbed IR-radiation will be entirely transformed into heat. Rather it is conceivable that a part of it is re-emitted, to wit in all directions. But the link between the two phenomena is not known.

5. The question of radiation emission by hot gases is related with it since it is obvious that any gas, also air, begins to radiate to such an extent as it is warmed-up. This question arises when the so-called radiative energy transfer is studied. But instead of empiric measurements, complicated theories were developed [15-17] starting from the abstruse assumption that the atmosphere behaves like a black body obeying Stefan-Boltzmann’s emission law, and disregarding the kinetic gas theory.
Overall it must be assessed that the atmospheric theory is on a shaky ground. widely missing empiric key methods to check the principles and their consequences.
Air Vs. CO2 Experiment: ‘The Final Proof That The Climate Theory Cannot Be True’
Beyond, there is an aspect which hitherto has been overlooked, and which delivers the final proof that the climate theory cannot be true. It is the topic of the here reported author’s work [Allmendinger, 2016] concerning thermal measurements instead of spectroscopic ones, and delivering the evidence that any gas absorbs IR-radiation – but in the short wavelength range -, with the consequence that air is warmed up by direct solar insolation – as well as by artificial IR-light – up to a limiting temperature due to radiative emission, and leading to an equilibrium state.
Preliminary tests for the present investigation were made with solar light using square twin-tubes from Styrofoam (3 cm thick, 1 m long, outer diameter 25 cm), each equipped with three thermometers at different positions, and covered above and below by a thin transparent foil (preferably a 0.01 mm thick Saran-wrap). The tubes were pivoted on a frame in such a way that they could be oriented in the direction of the solar light (Figure 3). One tube was filled with air, the other with carbon-dioxide. Incipiently, the tubes were covered on the tops with aluminium-foils being removed at the start of the experiment.
The primary experimental result was quite astonishing in many respects.
Firstly: The content gases warmed within a few minutes by approximately 10°C up to a constant limiting temperature. This was surprising – at least in the case of air – for no warming-up was anticipated since sunlight is colourless and allegedly not able to absorb any IR-radiation. However, the existence of a limiting temperature is conceivable since a growing radiative emission has to be expected as far as the temperature rises.
Secondly: The limiting temperatures were more or less equal at any measuring point. This means that the intensity of the sun beam was virtually not affected by the heat absorption in the gas tube since the latter one was comparatively weak.
And thirdly: Between the two tubes [one filled with air, the other with CO2] no significant difference could be detected.  Therefore, thanks to this simple experiment a special effect of carbon dioxide on the direct sunlight absorption could already be excluded.
As evident from Figure 8, any gas absorbs IR-light – even the noble [non-greenhouse] gases argon, neon and helium do so – while there is no significant difference between argon and carbon dioxide, but only a small difference between carbon-dioxide and air.

Conclusion/Summary
Besides a critical discussion of the convenient atmosphere theory profoundly questioning the greenhouse thesis by disclosing several basic errors, the here reported investigation reveals the discovery of direct absorption of shortwave IR-radiation by air. It is part of the incident solar light, but also of artificial light which enables a more exact detection. It is caused by another effect than the one which is responsible for the longer-wave absorption being observed at carbon dioxide, and it is not detectable by IR-spectroscopy since its absorption coefficient is too low. However, it is clearly detectable by means of the here applied apparatus leading to a distinct temperature elevation up to a limiting temperature which depends on the radiative emission. The limiting temperature depends on the gas kind, whereby practically no difference between air and carbon-dioxide could be found.
Nevertheless, that direct absorption effect [shortwave] which was discovered thanks to this method probably contributes significantly to the warming up of the atmosphere while the warming-up due to carbon-dioxide can be neglected.
But since the direct absorption cannot be influenced, the surface albedo must be focused as the governing factor providing the only [anthropogenic] opportunity to mitigate the climate, or at least the microclimate, by changing colour and structure of the surface, particularly in urban areas. However, a prediction seems not feasible since the global climate is too complex. But the greenhouse theory turns out to be a phantasm delivering the wrong diagnosis for the climate change, and a wrong diagnosis cannot enable a healing.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve written on a couple of occasions about how some in the German government are demanding that Germany start banning the internal combustion engine already by 2030 and switch to electric cars — a radical proposal to say the least.
Some two weeks ago the online FOCUS magazine commented on this here, writing, however, that “the electric car is an economic disaster” and that some experts believe that the “German automotive industry has no chance to survive“.
It needs to be mentioned that the German auto industry is the backbone of the German economy, as it is directly and indirectly responsible for 1 of every 5 jobs. This makes it the logical place to begin for any anyone harboring a desire to destroy the German industrial base.
FOCUS quotes future expert Stephan Rammler:
Replacing 40 million internal combustion engine cars with 40 million electric cars makes no sense. As long as we have no closed loop economy, the electrification and digitalization will lead to an economic disaster.”
Rammler then goes on to predict that the German auto industry would never survive such a transformation because the competition in Asia is already able to make products that are just as good, citing Borgward or Lynk & Co., who are already planning to sell in Germany.

According to auto industry expert Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, 250,000 German jobs of a total of 800,000 directly in the auto industry are at risk, especially jobs with mid-size automotive suppliers.
In a video posted by FOCUS here, Sebastian Viehmann explains that the lost jobs would result from the simplification of the cars. For example an internal combustion engine has some 1200 parts, while an electric motor has only 17. Suppliers for the individual parts and assemblies would no longer be needed. Also electric cars would become such a simple product that they could be snapped up at a supermarket in the same way a shopper buys a toaster. Automotive dealerships and repair shops would become redundant.
When looking at self-driving, autonomous cars, the insurance industry would also end up losing lots of business. In the event of an accident, the manufacturer would be liable, and not the driver. Many drivers would likely welcome that.
A lot of these changes of course can be viewed as advantages for the consumers, and highly skilled workers would be freed up to focus on other technical challenges and development.
But there are still the questions surrounding range and batteries, and the environmental impacts the manufacture and disposal of the batteries would have. Moreover, does it make sense to rush in a panic into a technology that is still a long way from being feasible? Perhaps a gradual, flexible transition over 50 – 75 years would make more sense.
Furthermore, internal combustion engines have made great strides when it comes to efficiency and cleanliness. In some categories they offer huge advantages.

With The ‘Global’ Warming Narrative

According to overseers of the long-term instrumental temperature data, the Southern Hemisphere record is “mostly made up”.  This is due to an extremely limited number of available measurements both historically and even presently from the south pole to the equatorial regions.
Below is an actual e-mail conversation between the Climate Research Unit’s Phil Jones and climate scientist Tom Wigley.  Phil Jones is the one who is largely responsible for making up the 1850-present temperature data for the Met Office in the UK (HadCRUT).



According to Peterson and Vose (1997), in 1901 the representation of maximum/minimum instrumental temperature stations in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) up through the equatorial regions (South Asia, North Africa, Central America) was negligible.  Only coastal Australia had substantial instrumental representation in the early 20th century.   The rest of the temperature data for the SH and equatorial regions needed to be made up to extend “global” instrumental temperature data back to 1850.

 

To measure the historical temperature record for the bottom half of the planet, then, scientists use proxy evidence from such sources as ice cores or alkenones to reconstruct past climates.  When they do that, a common theme emerges.  The proxy evidence used in temperature reconstructions suggests that there has been no significant changes in temperature from Antarctica to the regions near or just above the equator in the last few centuries.  In other words, half the globe has not been following along with the anthropogenic “global” warming narrative.
Listed below are about 75 graphical reconstructions indicating no obvious warming trend during the last few hundred years of assumed anthropogenic influence on surface temperatures.

“We show that water masses linked to North Pacific and Antarctic intermediate waters were warmer by 2.1°C and 1.5°C, respectively, during the middle Holocene Thermal Maximum than over the past century. Both water masses were ~0.9°C warmer during the Medieval Warm period than during the Little Ice Age and ~0.65° warmer than in recent decades.”

“[T]he reconstruction…shows that recent warming (until AD 2009) is not exceptional in the context of the past century. For example, the periods around AD 1940 and from AD 1950–1955 were warmer. … [B]ased on tree ring analyses from the upper tree limit in northern Patagonia, Villalba et al. (2003) found that the period just before AD 1950 was substantially warmer than more recent decades.”

“The climate of the interior of South Africa was around 1°C cooler in Little Ice Age [AD 1300 to 1800] and may have been over 3°C higher than at present during the extremes of the medieval warm period [AD 1000 to 1300].”
“It was variable throughout the millennium, but considerably more so during the warming of the eleventh to thirteenth centuries.  The lowest temperature events recorded during the Little Ice Age in South Africa are coeval with the Maunder and Sporer Minima in solar irradiance.  The medieval warming is shown to have coincided with … the Medieval Maximum in solar radiation.”

"The gases heating the planet at higher levels in 2018 than humans have ever recorded, according to an authoritative report published by the American Meteorological Society and compiled by the US government.Greenhouse gases were at levels unseen in 60 years of modern measurements and 800,000 years of ice core data, the study found. The data used in the 325-page report was collected from more than 470 scientists in 60 countries.The global annual average for carbon dioxide, which is elevated because of human activities such as driving cars and burning fuel, was 407.4 parts per million, 2.4 ppm higher than in 2017. The warming influence of CO2 and other gases in the atmosphere is now nearly 43% stronger than in 1990.2018 was the fourth warmest year since the mid-to-late 1800s. Temperatures were 0.3C to 0.4C higher than the average between 1981 and 2010. Only 2015, 2016, and 2017 were hotter. Sea levels were the highest on record, and sea surface temperatures were also near a record high.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the report “found that the major indicators of climate change continued to reflect trends consistent with a warming planet”.The extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice was near a record low, and glaciers continued to melt and lose mass for the 30th year in a row. Mexico reported its third warmest year in its 48-year record, and Alaska reported its second warmest in its 94-year record. Australia had its third warmest year since 1910, with a rapidly intensifying and expanding drought and significant fires.Europe experienced its second warmest year since at least 1950. Several countries set or came close to temperature records, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, France, Greece, Italy and Serbia, Sweden recorded its highest ever monthly temperature of 22.5C in Stockholm in July, and France experienced a heatwave with temperatures above 40C in late July and early August. Lithuania and Latvia declared states of emergency in response to severe heat and drought. . In Sweden and Greece there were unprecedented wildfires. Low water levels in the Rhine and Danube made it harder to transport goods and run power plants. Despite huge wildfires in the Arctic and the US recently, fire activity globally was the lowest on record in 2018, the result of humans have turned grasslands that have burned into agricultural areas.Hawaii saw a new US record for precipitation over 24 hours, at 1,262 mm at Waipā Gardens in Kauai, and India set a new world record for three-day rainfall of 710.2 mm in Iduki district. There were 14 weather and climate events in the US that each caused more than $1bn in damage, the fourth highest figure since records began in 1980. Hurricane Michael was the fourth strongest storm to ever hit the continental US, killing more than 30 people and causing between $15bn and $20bn in damages. There was also a record number of Category 5 storms in the tropics, where 11 were recorded. Super typhoon Mangkhut killed 160 people and caused $6bn in damages in the western North Pacific, and tropical storm Son-Tinh killed 170 in Vietnam and Laos. The Caribbean suffered coral bleaching and South America experienced seven extreme snowfall events."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI was a bit hesitant to write about this because it could lead to trouble for the person with the courage to speak up. After all, we’d hate to see riots, violence and rabid fits of shouting.
But the good fight must be fought, and we must never be forced into silence – even when our livelihoods depend on it.
German Parliamentarian and physicist Dr. Philipp Lengsfeld of Angela Merkel’s (once) conservative CDU party gave a short talk last year at the 10th IKEK international climate and energy conference late last year in Berlin.

Dr. Lengsfeld, the son of human rights, anti-Communism activist Vera Lengsfeld, sees the green movement for what it really is: an oppressive system designed to strip the individual liberties from citizens.
Skeptics, EIKE, doing “a service to science and democracy”
The European Institute fro Climate and Energy, which co-hosted the conference and posted the video, wrote:
He compares the ideals of communism to those of the climate rescue ideology, namely rescuing mankind from itself and leading it collectively to paradise conditions – if only it would surrender its rights and the dignity of individualism. Both of these can be achieved only by dictatorship and Lengsfeld calls them criminal – even with respect to those stated in climate ideology.”
At the 1:50 mark he thanks EIKE and reminds the audience that “science and democracy thrive from the same basis: freedom, creativity and competition”…
Autocracy, on the other hand, lives from conformity, solidarity and brutal selfishness when it comes to asserting their own interests. Therefore it is totally clear to me that you are performing a service to science and to democracy.” And for that my deepest thanks.”
He then adds that the skeptics are indeed “up against an autocratic system” of the likes of the former Communist regimes and that there are in fact many similarities between the climate movement and the communist regimes.
Climate science a dangerous mixture of dogma

He warns that the climate science is fraught with “belief and dogma“, what he calls “a very dangerous mixture“. He adds that although renewable energy sources have positive points, we now find ourselves in “a system of dogmas that has become complete certainty and that any thing else is wrong“.
He says that Germany’s attempt to be a leader in renewable energy has completely missed the target and has failed.
We are surrounded by interest-driven dogmatists who have staked a claim on morality and belittled anyone who challenges.”
His advice to skeptics on this is to continue doing what we are doing, but warns:
Please stay scientific. Do not make the mistake of multiplying everything by minus one. That is not going to work. You may get some short term success here and there, but I think it is not the right strategy.”
Let’s get loud
He then calls “evidence-driven policy” and illusion:
If you are honest, policymaking means evidence considering. […] Evidence-driven implies already an eternal truth, it already implies that one sole solution is needed and that it is only necessary to give it to the Parliamentarians and insist that it is what you have to do and everything will be fine. But it doesn’t work that way. That’s not how the world is. That is not how people are. That’s not how science is.”
Lengsfeld advises skeptics to continue with a “fair discussion, a balanced discussion, but certainly not with a quiet discussion“.
Lengsfeld is optimistic, and believes the skeptics actually will have an easy time because the opponents have “run afoul.”
Look like “idiots”
Lengsfeld believes that climate science likely will go the same way as continental drift, where continents were once believed to be fixed on the globe, and that Alfred Wegener was eventually proven to be correct by claiming they were moving. Today, Lengsfeld said, everyone says that the scientists insisting on static continents now look like “idiots.”

"Some seek to convey the wonder of endangered animals while others give tips on how to tackle waste or tell tales of inspirational environmental activists. All are part of what children’s publishers are calling “the Greta Thunberg effect”: a boom in books aimed at empowering young people to save the planet.  The number of new children’s books looking at the climate crisis, global heating and the natural world has more than doubled over the past 12 months, according to data from Nielsen Book Research shared with the Observer. Sales have also doubled. Whether it’s beautifully illustrated factual books like A Wild Child’s Guide to Endangered Animals, apocalyptic climate catastrophe novels such as Where the River Runs Gold or how-to guides such as Kids Fight Plastic, publishers are targeting a plethora of new fiction and nonfiction titles at young readers inspired by Thunberg, the 16-year-old climate emergency campaigner. Earth Heroes, which features Thunberg on its cover, is one of them. A collection of stories by travel journalist Lily Dyu about 20 individual inventors and conservationists around the world, including Sir David Attenborough, Yin Yuzhen, Stella McCartney and Thunberg, it was snapped up in June by children’s publishers Nosy Crow. “I absolutely would say there has been a Greta Thunberg effect,” says Rachel Kellehar, head of nonfiction. “She has galvanised the appetite of young people for change, and that has galvanised our appetite, as publishers, for stories that empower our readers to make those changes.” Kellehar has sent the collection hurtling through the publishing process at breakneck speed so that it will hit bookshelves in early October, just before Thunberg find outs if she will be awarded the Nobel peace prize: “We’re turning this around in four months, which is really unusual in children’s publishing.” The message of the book is: you’re not alone and you can make a difference, she says. “We feel it’s important to get that message out as soon as possible, and that is partly driven by the Greta effect. Whether or not she wins the Nobel peace prize, October will be a key moment to reach out and say Greta’s doing this amazing thing, but also lots of other people you’ve never heard of all around the world are doing amazing things. From young girls in Indonesia who have got plastic bags banned, to an engineer in India who is creating artificial glaciers, this is a book about people who are finding different ways to confront climate change head on, wherever it is affecting them.” Bloomsbury will publish a similar collection, Fantastically Great Women who Saved the Planet by Kate Pankhurst, in February. It features women throughout history who have dedicated their lives to studying, conserving and protecting planet Earth. Isobel Doster, senior editor in children’s nonfiction, has also noticed a “Thunberg effect” – a “real thirst” for authors who write about environmental role models to whom children can look up and actions they can take to prevent climate change. “Additionally, there’s been a tonal shift in the natural history books that are coming on to the market, she says. “It’s not enough just to explore the beauty of the natural world – we have a responsibility to tell readers why it’s important to look after it.” Plastic is also a hot topic for nonfiction picture books: Walker Books recently acquired one by MG Leonard called Tale of a Toothbrush, which follows the journey of a single plastic toothbrush, while Hachette Children’s Group brought out A Planet Full of Plastic by Neal Layton earlier this summer. In fiction, Matt Haig’s illustrated chapter book Evie and the Animals – about a girl who wants to save the planet – won plaudits from critics for its timely storyline and strong appeal for Thunberg fans when it appeared on shelves in June. Meanwhile, fans of There’s a Rang-Tan in my Bedroom, the moving Greenpeace cartoon that went viral last year, were delighted when it was published last week as a picture book.  Author James Sellick hopes his story – about an orangutan who loses his home and family due to palm oil production and deforestation – will have greater longevity for children in picture-book form, where it can be revisited and given more context from parents. The book also offers tips about actions children can take, such as writing letters to companies that use palm oil. “I want not only to educate but to inspire a new wave of eco warriors. Kids are the future. Hopefully if they have been educated about environmental issues from a young age they will go on – and go further – than we are right now,” said Sellick. Designed in a similar way to inspire the next generation of conservationists, naturalists, biologists, zoologists and nature lovers, A Wild Child’s Guide to Endangered Animals will be published later this month. Author and illustrator Millie Marotta says she is hoping the book will tempt young readers to take a lifelong interest in wildlife conservation and show them there are things everyone can do to help, right now. “We’re losing so many species every year, every month, every day, even. The generation of children who will be reading this book are the ones who are going to be the most impacted, and who will have the biggest impact. They are going to be the people to fix what’s happened and hopefully turn things around.” Martin Dorey Written by a long time anti-plastics campaigner and founder of the Beach Clean Network, it shows children what they can do in their home, on days out and at school to reduce the plastic they use. Neal Layton Nonfiction picture book that explains where plastic comes from, why it doesn’t biodegrade and why that’s dangerous for animals and the planet.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLike so many (highly subsidized) green energy projects in Germany the Kalina geothermal power plant in Unterhaching, Germany, was put into operation with great fanfare some 8 years ago in 2009.
Look at all the great things we’re doing, high ranking politicians seemed to say as the cut the opening ribbon.
Today the online Merkur.de reports that the “prestige project of Germany” has been out of operation since summer, and so “possibly forever“. According to the Merkur, the plant has produced as much trouble as it has energy. Efforts to rescue the project have failed.

To produce power at the low temperature range between 90 and 200 °C, a complex and special power plant process is used. In Unterhaching, just south of Munich, the first Kalina geothermal power plant technology was used. Recently it was reported that the project may be be permanently shut down due to costs and technical problems. 
According to the company’s promotional video here, the plant was designed to produce 3.4 megawatts of electric power and 38 megawatts of district heating “for thousands of households“…”emissions-free, sustainable and renewable.

The partner for the district heating part of the Unterhaching plant, the community of Grünwald, has invested in cooperation with Unterhaching already 23.5 million euros over the past five years. Credits were also given by Grünwald and Unterhaching in an attempt to save the project from insolvency, but the geothermal plant has since turned into “a bottomless pit” and members of the town councils spoke of “an immense burden” and a “failed project” due to the losses from the electricity generation part of the plant.
According to the Merkur, the technical problems are not related to the Kalina technology itself, but rather due to material used for the heat exchangers of the power plant.
As soon as the plant was switched on for the first time just after its opening by then German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel, it began to stink like ammonia just a half hour later. At the time the heat exchanger leaked and rubber seals did not help. It had to be welded. Other technical problems plagued the plant.
The Merkur points out that the district heating part of the plant, which is the main part, “functions excellently“, adding: “More than 50% of the households in the community were provided with a hook-up to the geothermal plant in 2015.”
Yet, for the tens of millions of euros invested, that may be a very tiny consolation. Alternative energy seems to be burning cash rather than generating power.

"The tragedy of our times is that the gathering collapse of our life support systems has coincided with the age of public disservice. Just as we need to rise above self-interest and short-termism, governments around the world now represent the meanest and dirtiest of special interests. In the United Kingdom, the US, Brazil, Australia and many other nations, pollutocrats rule. The Earth’s systems are breaking down at astonishing speed. Wildfires roar across Siberia and Alaska – biting, in many places, deep into peat soils, releasing plumes of carbon dioxide and methane that cause more global heating. In July alone, Arctic wildfires are reckoned to have released as much carbon into the atmosphere as Austria does in a year: already the vicious twister of climate feedbacks has begun to turn.  Torrents of meltwater pour from the Greenland ice cap, sweltering under a 15C temperature anomaly. Daily ice losses on this scale are 50 years ahead of schedule: they were forecast in the climate models for 2070. A paper in Geophysical Research Letters reveals that the thawing of permafrost in the Canadian High Arctic now exceeds the depths of melting projected by scientists for 2090. While record temperatures in Europe last month caused discomfort and disruption, in south-west Asia they are starting to reach the point at which the human body hits its thermal limits. Ever wider tracts of the world will come to rely on air conditioning, not only for basic comfort but also for human survival: another feedback spiral, as air conditioning requires massive energy use. Those who cannot afford it will either move or die. Already, climate breakdown is driving more people from their homes than either poverty or conflict, while contributing to both these other factors. A recent paper in Nature shows that we have little hope of preventing more than 1.5C of global heating unless we retire existing fossil fuel infrastructure. Even if no new gas or coal power plants, roads and airports are built, the carbon emissions from current installations are likely to push us past this threshold. Only by retiring some of this infrastructure before the end of its natural life could we secure a 50% chance of remaining within the temperature limit agreed in Paris in 2015. Yet, far from decommissioning this Earth-killing machine, almost everywhere governments and industry stoke its fires. The oil and gas industry intends to spend $4.9tn over the next 10 years, exploring and developing new reserves, none of which we can afford to burn. According to the IMF, every year governments subsidise fossil fuels to the tune of $5tn – many times more than they spend on addressing our existential predicament. The US spends 10 times more on these mad subsidies than on its federal education budget. Last year, the world burned more fossil fuels than ever before. An analysis by Barry Saxifrage in Canada’s National Observer shows that half the fossil fuels ever used by humans have been burned since 1990. While renewable and nuclear power supplies have also risen in this period, the gap between the production of fossil fuels and low-carbon energy has not been narrowing, but steadily widening. What counts, in seeking to prevent runaway global heating, is not the good things we start to do, but the bad things we cease to do. Shutting down fossil infrastructure requires government intervention. But in many nations, governments intervene not to protect humanity from the existential threat of fossil fuels, but to protect the fossil fuel industry from the existential threat of public protest. In the US, legislators in 18 states have put forward bills criminalising protests against pipelines, seeking to crush democratic dissent on behalf of the oil industry. In June, Donald Trump’s administration proposed federal legislation that would jail people for up to 20 years for disrupting pipeline construction. Global Witness reports that, in several nations, led by the Philippines, governments have incited the murder of environmental protesters. The process begins with rhetoric, demonising civil protest as extremism and terrorism, then shifts to legislation, criminalising attempts to protect the living planet. Criminalisation then helps legitimise physical assaults and murder. A similar demonisation has begun in Britain, with the publication by a dark money-funded lobby group, Policy Exchange, of a report smearing Extinction Rebellion. Like all such publications, it was given a series of major platforms by the BBC, which preserved its customary absence of curiosity about who funded it. Secretly funded lobby groups – such as the TaxPayers’ Alliance, the Adam Smith Institute and the Institute of Economic Affairs – have supplied some of the key advisers to Boris Johnson’s government. He has also appointed Andrea Leadsom, an enthusiastic fracking advocate, to run the department responsible for climate policy, and Grant Shapps – who until last month chaired the British Infrastructure Group, which promotes the expansion of roads and airports – as transport secretary. Last week the Guardian revealed documents suggesting that the firm run by Johnson’s ally and adviser Lynton Crosby has produced unbranded Facebook ads on behalf of the coal industry. What we see here looks like the denouement of the Pollution Paradox. Because the dirtiest industries attract the least public support, they have the greatest incentive to spend money on politics, to get the results they want and we don’t. They fund political parties, lobby groups and thinktanks, fake grassroots organisations and dark ads on social media. As a result, politics comes to be dominated by the dirtiest industries. We are told to fear the “extremists” who protest against ecocide and challenge dirty industry and the dirty governments it buys. But the extremists we should fear are those who hold office. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Die Welt here reports that storm “Herwart” which swept across Germany late last month – with wind gusts of up to 140 kilometers per hour  – led to a wholesale electricity “price collapse” and thus “exposed the madness of the Energiewende“.
“Negative prices”
As storm Herwart waged, wind parks across Germany over-flooded electricity grids with power that was not needed, and thus forced electricity prices on the exchange to go deep into negative levels within just minutes. In a nutshell: grid operators were forced to pay to get rid of the surplus power. But that payment won’t go to consumers, as Die Welt writes:
The consumers get no benefit from this. For them it will even be more expensive.”
This is because as grid operators are forced to pay large buyers to accept the power that no one needs or wants, they will incur added costs, which of course will be passed on to the regular German consumers. Germans are already saddled with almost the highest rates in the world. This is despite the preposterous comments made by some media outlets suggesting that German consumers could even get paid for the disposal of waste power.
Market forces disabled
Die Welt presents a chart depicting wholesale power prices. It shows the price falling to -52.11 euros per megawatt hour. Moreover, the chart shows that these extreme negative prices have become more frequent over the past 18 months. Die Welt comments:
‘Herwart’ shows in a sobering manner the astounding design deficiency of the German Energiewende [transition to green energies]. “
Die Welt blames Germany’s Energiewende and the green energy feed-in act, which “systematically disable market forces”.
Thousands Of Older Wind Turbines To Be Dismantled

On another note, the Kiel, German-based Kieler Nachrichten (KN) reports “thousands of wind turbines will be supposedly dismantled over the coming decade because the state subsidies will run out“. “And according to the Berlin-based specialty company Energy Brainpool, these turbines will not be replaced if energy prices do not increase.
Subsidies running out
Economists of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research also expect a decommissioning of a considerable number of older turbines. The 2020s could be a decade where Germany may start to see the end of the wind energy madness. It all depends on the price of electricity in beginning in 2021. Wind turbines originally were guaranteed fixed feed-in rates for a period of 20 years. Now that these early systems are approaching that lifetime and the feed-in tariffs expire, it is questionable that they will continue to operate.
Too expensive to keep in operation

Many old turbines are likely to be put out of commission because they require greats amounts of costly maintenance and repairs, and so likely will not be profitable to operate. The KN writes:

The current wholesale electricity price of 3 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour will not be enough to keep the turbines in operation…”.

The KN cites the Bundesverband Windenergie (German Association for Wind Energy) which estimates that some 14,000 MW of installed capacity face being shut down by 2023. “That would be more than a quarter of the currently installed onshore wind energy capacity getting removed.”
A monument to an industrial folly
The question that remains is what will happen to these thousands of shut down turbines. Will they be abandoned and thus leave the country’s idyllic landscape a mass junkyard – a monument to one of the greatest industrial follies man has ever witnessed?

Share this...FacebookTwitterLast Wednesday evening, Florida State University graduate student Levi Cowan showed at his Tropical Tidbits site his analysis of what was later to develop into tropical storm Nate in the Gulf of Mexico.
His analysis exposed the great differences – thus huge uncertainty – between the US GFS and the European ECMWF models for the early projected tracks of Nate.
Levi shows the two different model projections below:

In the above figure, the NOAA’s GFS model run takes the storm track over Louisiana (left) while the European showed landfall occurring some 400 miles away to the east at the start of the Florida panhandle (right). If that doesn’t illustrate the huge uncertainty within models, then what does? Source: Image cropped from Tropical Tidbits.
Keep in mind that these two projections for Nate coming from two different models are for just 4 days out, despite being generated by super computers that have been fed with reams of data.
In Levi’s latest analysis here, he shows that the latest storm track now favors the GFS and that the European had been flawed.
Great uncertainty even with forecasts just hours ahead

Meanwhile on Thursday storm Xavier passed through Northern Germany. Mid morning on Thursday the German DWD national weather service tweeted here how the forecast track of the storm over northern Germany over the coming 6 hours was still uncertain!

In the chart above the low pressure system Xavier designated by “T” was centered just over the North Sea just west of Hamburg and moving eastward. The DWD chart above shows the uncertainty of the storm’s projected path with a range of some 150 km upon reaching the Polish border just hours later. Models cannot even predict storm location even 6 hours in advance!
Too much emphasis on models?
Surely meteorologists will be the first to admit that the complexity of storm systems is still far too great to allow predictions of any reliable certainty.
In a recent daily summary at Weatherbell Analytics, veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi even cautioned against relying too heavily on models, which he said sometimes flip flop between scenarios in just 6 hours. Bastardi feels there has to be greater emphasis on patterns observed over the decades. Already two weeks earlier on September 22 Bastardi warned of a Gulf storm developing between October 1 and October 10. He was right. His forecast was based on patterns, and made long before models sniffed out the storm. Models indeed still have a very long way to go.
If a 6-hour projection is uncertain, then projections out 20 years are worthless
This gives us an idea of what to expect of climate models going out 20, 50 or even 100 years in the future, which woefully lack long-term historical data from major climate drivers such as the oceans, continents, sun and atmosphere. Little wonder that IPCC climate model temperature projections made 10 years ago are already wrong.
But if you happen to be someone who is still sold on the projections made by these climate models, then I’ve got a great deal on a bridge in Brooklyn for you.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s DWD national weather service has the preliminary September 2017 report out. According to the result of the data measured by the country’s 2000 weather stations, last month was cooler than normal.
September 2017 in Germany saw a mean temperature of 12.7°C, which was 4.2°C cooler than last year’s record warm September (16.9°C). This means that the month came in 0.8°C colder than the 1981-2010 mean.
September in Central Europe was also cloudier and wetter than normal. The cool, autumn-like weather was caused by low pressure systems pumping cool air from northern Europe.
The DWD also reports some regions in Germany saw frost, for example Deutschneudorf-Brüderwiese recorded a temperature -1,5 °C on the morning of September 19.
Austria sees coolest September in 10 years
Also Austria’s ZAMG national weather service reported that September in the mountainous country recorded the coldest September in 10 years, and that in the mountains it was even the coldest in over 15 years. The following ZAMG chart shows the country’s temperature anomaly from the mean:

ZAMG climatologist Alexander Orlik reported:
There were also some new record snowfalls. For example at the Villacher Alpe, 2140 meters above sea level, it was the the snowiest September since snowfall measurements began in 1925. Over the month some 78 cm of fresh snow fell.”
Cool weather, heavy snow forecast for early October
The colder temperatures are expected to continue through early October, according to Schneefan at climate and weather site wobleibtdieerderwaermiung.de here, citing meteociel. The following meteociel chart depicts the projection for October, 2017.
According to meteociel on September 28, cold weather is projected to dominate Central and Eastern Europe in October (850 hPa – approx. 1500 m). Source: www.meteociel.fr/modeles/cfsme_cartes.php
The US GFS also confirms this cool projection.
Heavy snowfall forecast for the Alps
Finally Schneefan writes that “heavy snowfall is forecast for the week ahead across Austria and Switzerland!”

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs Europe and USA brace for more frigid weather, some are asking if this is what we need to expect to cope with in the future.
Now it’s clear that the recent “record warm” 2 years had little to do with CO2, and instead were almost entirely due to the well-known El-Nino phenomenon over the past two years.
And now that the recent El Nino has disappeared, temperatures globally are in a free fall and back at levels of the previous decade and indications show a further  drop.

The ENSO now in cool phase
Unfortunately even that enhanced layer of CO2 we have in the atmosphere was not able to trap any of the recent heat. The 20-year pause remains pretty much intact, and will be extended as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) hovers near the cooling La Nina territory.
Note that it will take the cooler equatorial Pacific surface temperatures a few months to make there way into the lower tropospheric satellite data. Don’t be surprised if this year we see a repeat of 1999.
Last El Nino not really warmer than 1998
Dr. Roy Spencer here wrote that 2016 will in fact NOT be statistically warmer of any significance compared to 1998.
According to global warming theory, the earth is supposed to warm some 2.0 to 4.5°C by 2100, which means 0.2 – 0.45°C per decade. So shouldn’t the recent El Nino have warmed the globe some 0.4 to 0.8°C more than 1998? Not even close, as the speedometer below shows! For hardcore warmists, it is increasingly becoming a huge challenge to explain the glaring lack of warming so far this century.

German weather and climate analysis site wobleibtdieerderwaermung here writes on this:
The IPCC climate models for the temperature development have been way too high with their estimation as the comparison of the model calculations to the real, observed development recorded by satellite for January 2001 to Juni 2016.
The Global Warming Speedometer for January 2001 to June 2016 shows observed warming on the HadCRUT4 and NCEI surface temperature datasets as below IPCC’s least prediction in 1990 and somewhat on the low side of its 1995 and 2001 predictions, while the satellite datasets show less warming than all IPCC predictions from 1990 to 2001. Later IPCC predictions are too recent to be reliably testable. Source: Is the Reuters “news” agency committing fraud?“
North Atlantic is cooling
Things also do not bode well for the global warming alarmists in the Atlantic as well, as Kenneth Richard pointed out here yesterday: “North Atlantic Cooling Has Plunged Below 1950s (And 1800s) Levels – And Scientists Project More Cooling“.

"Switching just some of the huge subsidies supporting fossil fuels to renewables would unleash a runaway clean energy revolution, according to a new report, significantly cutting the carbon emissions that are driving the climate crisis. Coal, oil and gas get more than $370bn (£305bn) a year in support, compared with $100bn for renewables, the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) report found. Just 10-30% of the fossil fuel subsidies would pay for a global transition to clean energy, the IISD said.  Ending fossil fuel subsidies has long been seen as vital to tackling the climate emergency, with the G20 nations pledging in 2009 to phase them out, but progress has been limited. In May, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, attacked subsidies, saying: “What we are doing is using taxpayers’ money – which means our money – to boost hurricanes, to spread droughts, to melt glaciers, to bleach corals. In one word: to destroy the world.” The new analysis shows how redirecting some of the fossil fuel subsidies could decisively tip the balance in favour of green energy, making it the cheapest electricity available and instigating a rapid global rollout. “Almost everywhere, renewables are so close to being competitive that [a 10-30% subsidy swap] tips the balance, and turns them from a technology that is slowly growing to one that is instantly the most viable and can replace really large amounts of generation,” said Richard Bridle of the IISD. “It goes from being marginal to an absolute no-brainer.” The transition from polluting fossil fuels to clean energy is already under way. Annual investment in renewables has been greater than that in fossil fuel electricity generation since 2008 and new renewable capacity has exceeded fossil fuel power each year since 2014. But progress is slow compared with the urgency required, said Bridle. “There is no question that renewables can power the energy system,” he said. “The question now is can we transition quickly enough away from fuels like coal, and subsidy reform is a very obvious step towards that.” Very few ways of cutting emissions actually save governments money, he said. “Taking away subsidies from fossil fuels and channelling them towards clean energy would boost their development at a much faster pace, and help secure our climate goals,” said Ipek Gençsü of the Overseas Development Institute. An added bonus is the social and economic benefits, such as reduced air pollution and health spending, she said. “A key breakthrough [in the energy transition] could occur if countries cut their fossil fuel subsidies, which are propping up dirty energy,” said Rana Adib, the executive secretary of the global sustainable energy network REN21. A recent REN21 report found 112 nations subsidised fossil fuel prices. Reform of fossil fuel subsidies could have a significant impact on global heating. An earlier IISD study of 20 countries with large fossil fuel subsidies found that a 30% swap to renewables would lead to emissions reductions of between 11% and 18%. Most experts define fossil fuel subsidies as financial or tax support for those buying fuel or the companies producing it. The IMF also includes the cost of the damage fossil fuel burning causes to climate and health, leading to an estimate of $5.2tn of fossil fuel subsidies in 2017, or $10m a minute. Ending the subsidies would cut global emissions by about a quarter, the IMF estimates, and halve the number of early deaths from fossil fuel air pollution. Bridle said funding fossil fuel subsidies was “madness”, but said ending them could cause short-term price rises and political difficulties, as the benefits of lower costs in the future and reduced air pollution are less obvious. “There are political problems but it is worth persevering because the prize is so big,” he said. “You have to bring people along with you.” Gençsü said governments must ensure that the most vulnerable people were not adversely affected by changes. Fossil fuel subsidies are most prominent in oil-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia, which subsidises petrol, and some coal-using countries such as Indonesia, which caps the cost of the fuel at 75% of the market rate. Some nations are making progress, with India cutting petrol subsidies by about 75% since 2014, according to the IISD."
"If your attention during the Women’s World Cup was on the pitch rather than the players, you might have noticed that the matches were all played on real grass. That was a hard-won change, made after the US team complained to Fifa that they sustained more injuries on artificial turf. In private gardens, however, the opposite trend is happening: British gardens are being dug up and replaced with plastic grass. But this isn’t the flaky, fading stuff on which oranges were once displayed at the greengrocer. Today’s artificial grass is nearly identical to the real thing.  With products named after beautiful places – Lake District, Valencia – modern artificial turf mimics not just the mottled colouring and shape of grass blades, but the warm springiness of earth. Unlike the grass itself, the market is growing. Dozens of specialist firms now market fake grass as a replacement for garden lawns. UK sales surged during last year’s record summer temperatures, according to the industry journal Hortweek, while a report by Up Market Research valued the global market at $2.5bn (£2bn) in 2016 and forecasts a “staggering” rise to $5.8bn by 2023. Andy Driver, sales and marketing director for the artificial turf supplier Evergreens UK, says that as artificial grass has become much cheaper and more realistic, it now appeals to a wide range of people: city residents with shaded gardens where grass doesn’t grow well, or to carpet urban rooftops and balconies; families with children or dogs who don’t want a muddy mess; older or disabled people who struggle to maintain a garden; schools and nurseries where playgrounds get heavy use. For many people, he says, there is a social pressure to “keep up with the Joneses” by having a perfectly trimmed, green lawn all year round. Perhaps aware of another kind of social pressure, some firms pitch their products as eco-friendly alternatives. For example, Royal Grass says its environmentally friendly turf, called Eco-Sense, is recyclable (“in other words, cradle-to-cradle”) and declares that it “has the look and feel of natural grass, but outperforms its natural source of inspiration”: “‘Green’ is a premium goal in our quest on how we can make our artificial grass more sustainable. This starts at the beginning of the process, with the careful selection of the raw materials that are used to produce the grass blades.” But while the fake grass might indeed be greener, at least in colour, its environmental impacts are difficult to gloss over. Paul Hetherington, fundraising director for the charity Buglife, says artificial turf is far from an eco-friendly alternative to natural grass. “It blocks access to the soil beneath for burrowing insects, such as solitary bees, and the ground above for soil dwellers such as worms, which will be starved of food beneath it,” he says. “It provides food for absolutely no living creatures.” This is a particular concern in view of the dramatic global decline in insect species. The UK is on course to miss its own targets for protecting its natural spaces, and has lost 97% of its wildflower meadows in a single generation. It is not just wildlife that artificial turf affects. The Committee on Climate Change recommends rewilding a huge area of UK land and growing many more trees to help tackle global heating by storing carbon. Not only does fake grass have no climate benefits, but producing the plastic emits carbon and uses fossil fuels. The common practice of replacing soil with sand to provide a more stable bed for the fake grass also releases even more CO2 stored in the earth, according to David Elliott, chief executive of tree-planting charity Trees for Cities. There is also the matter of microplastics: the tiny particles of plastic that have made their way throughout the globe, and are present in our food, water and even the air. Evergreen UK’s turf is made mainly of polyethylene, with polypropylene and polyamide for some purposes. Driver claims the microplastics problem does not affect the artificial grass industry because it doesn’t sell single-use products. “Our products don’t degrade, we’ve always not had it as an issue, basically.” He adds that products from legitimate firms conform to standards set by the industry. Madeleine Berg, project manager at the environmental charity Fidra, counters that most plastics are likely to contribute to microplastics through physical and chemical degradation, such as being stepped on and exposed to constant sunlight. “You would be hard-pressed to say that you have created a product which doesn’t shed anything,” says Berg. There are also growing concerns about the impact of the synthetic chemicals that are added to artificial grass on human health and the environment. The EU has been investigating specialist artificial turf used on sports fields for suspected carcinogens, and is considering banning intentionally added microplastics. While these are different products to those sold to home gardeners, Berg says artificial pitches are sometimes reused for landscaping. And what happens to fake grass when it reaches the end of its life in 10-20 years? Unlike Royal Grass, Evergreens UK doesn’t market itself as eco-friendly, a term Driver calls “a little bit misleading”, but he is keen to stress that his company’s products can be recycled. However, this can only be done at specialist plants in Europe and it is doubtful that many customers would go the extra mile. Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), says there is a place for artificial turf as an alternative to paving slabs, gravel and particularly concrete, which is its own environmental nightmare. “Hard landscaping can be very expensive, and people fancy a bit of green in a small garden. We’ve even laid a bit [of artificial grass] ourselves. “But I don’t think that for all but specialised purposes that it really compares with [real] grass. Not only does it not provide any of the environmental benefits of grass – like soaking up moisture, home for insects, feeding birds, self-sustaining – its life isn’t that long. It gets trampled on and quite soon looks poor. It can’t be relaid or reseeded; it has to be rolled up, lifted and sent to landfill.” Barter concedes that the root of the problem is social pressure for a perfect green lawn. “In the mindset of the British public you haven’t really got a garden unless you’ve got a lawn,” he says. “And I think a lot of people are put off by lawns because there’s so much quite confusing technical speak around it like mowing, feeding, weeding, moss control and overseeding. A lot of people just aren’t interested – they don’t have time in their busy lives.” There are some environmental benefits to using artificial grass. Unlike a real lawn, fake grass doesn’t need to be mowed – which some people do with electric or fossil fuel mowers – or watered, which is a serious consideration as the UK anticipates increasing water stress due to the climate crisis. Nor does it require fertilisers or herbicides, some of which have been subject to huge controversy, to achieve a uniform look. But lawns can also be maintained without those negative practices and products, and the soil loss problem is real: the RHS’ Greening Grey Britain survey has found a threefold rise in the number of front gardens that have been paved over. Barter also challenges the idea that artificial turf is maintenance-free, saying it still needs to be cleaned of litter and moss growth, and some owners have simply replaced mowing with vacuuming. “There are better solutions that would give people more pleasure than just looking out at this sheet of slowly degrading plastic,” he says. He suggests planting shady front gardens with tolerant shrubs, such as evergreen bushes: these provide greenery all year round, need little maintenance, suppress weeds, offer food for wildlife and places for birds to nest, and give hedgehogs and frogs cover to travel safely in urban streets. “After all, we are supposed to be a nation of gardeners.” To Trevor Dines, botanical specialist for charity Plantlife, the popularity of artificial grass shows how disconnected we have become from the natural world. “Whenever I see artificial grass my heart sinks – more nature smothered by more plastic. Where once we were famed for our lawns, we now opt for artificial, low-maintenance solutions. “This is not just to the detriment of wildlife but to us, too; children can’t make a daisy-chain on a plastic lawn.” Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"

Sea Level Just 1.5 cm For 1900-2010

As the HadCRUT4 temperature data indicate, there has been no net warming trend in the Arctic for the last 80 years.  In fact, from the early 1940s to the mid-1990s, the Arctic cooled.


HadCRUT Arctic Temperature 1920-2017 (Climate4You)

Due to its Arctic location, Greenland temperatures have likewise followed a similar trend as the rest of the region — warming during the 1920s to 1940s, cooling from the 1940s to 1990s, and then warming (commensurate with the 1930s) since the 1990s.

van As et al., 2016


Climate Alarm Advocates: Arctic Will Contribute 19-25 cm To Sea Levels By 2100

Despite the relatively unremarkable temperature trends in the Arctic in general or Greenland in particular in the last 100 years, the narrative that says man-made CO2 emissions are causing catastrophic Arctic ice melt and consequent sea level rise has gained widespread popularity in media circles.
For example, in yet another alarmist headline from this last week it was claimed that some Arctic glaciers will “disappear completely” in the next 83 years and this “extreme” Arctic ice melt will lead to 19 to 25 centimeters of sea level rise by 2100.


“By the end of this century, as some glaciers disappear completely, the Arctic’s contribution to global sea level rise will reach at least 19 to 25 centimeters, according to the report by the Arctic Council’s Arctic Monitoring Assessment Program (AMAP).”


New Paper Concludes Greenland Contributed Just 1.5 cm To Sea Levels Since 1900

A new scientific paper published in The Cryosphere last week indicates that the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) gained mass during much of the 1940s to 2000s period — especially 1961-1990, the common reference period when it was previously assumed the GIS was stable.
In fact, the scientists conclude that the overall GIS melt for the entire 1900-2010 period contributed a negligible 1.5 centimeters (about half an inch) to sea levels during that entire 110-year period.



Fettweis et al ., 2017
“Results from all MAR simulations indicate that the period 1961–1990, commonly chosen as a stable reference period for Greenland SMB [surface mass balance] and ice dynamics, is actually a period of anomalously positive SMB (∼ +40 Gt yr−1 ) compared to 1900–2010. … [T]he ERA-20C forced simulation suggests that SMB [surface mass balance] during the 1920–1930 warm period over Greenland was comparable to the SMB of the 2000s, due to both higher melt and lower precipitation than normal.”
“The period 1961–1990 has been considered as a period when the total mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet was stable (Rignot and Kanagaratnam, 2006) and near zero. However, at the last century scale, all MAR reconstructions suggest that SMB [surface mass balance] was particularly positive during this period [1961-1990] (SMB was most positive from the 1970s to the middle of the 1990s), suggesting that mass gain may well have occurred during this period, in agreement with results from Colgan et al. (2015).”
“Finally, with respect to the 1961–1990 period, the integrated contribution of the GrIS SMB anomalies over 1900–2010 is a sea level rise of about 15 ± 5 mm [1.5 cm], with a null contribution from the 1940s to the 2000s, suggesting that the recent contribution of GrIS to sea level change (van den Broeke et al., 2016) is unprecedented in the last century.”

Between 1920-1930, Greenland Warmed By 2 to 4°C In Less Than 10 Years

Chylek et al., 2004
“A significant and rapid temperature increase was observed at all Greenland stations between 1920 and 1930. The average annual temperature rose between 2 and 4 °C in less than ten years. Since the change in anthropogenic production of greenhouses gases at that time was considerably lower than today, this rapid temperature increase suggests a large natural variability of the regional climate.”

Glacier Melt Rapid, Contribution To Sea Level Rise Substantially Higher Before 1950

Gregory et al., 2013


Fernández-Fernández et al., 2017
“The abrupt climatic transition of the early 20th century and the 25-year warm period 1925–1950 triggered the main retreat and volume loss of these glaciers since the end of the ‘Little Ice Age’. Meanwhile, cooling during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s altered the trend, with advances of the glacier snouts.”
“During the period 1898–1946, the snout of Gljúfurárjökull retreated 635 m, almost two-thirds of the total distance from the LIA maximum (1898–1903) to 2005, at an average rate of 13.2 m yr−1. … The trend in Western Tungnahryggsjökull during the first half of the 20th century was a more rapid retreat, showing the highest average rates of the whole period (19.5 m yr−1). By 1946, this glacier had retreated almost 90% of the total recorded between the LIA maximum (1868) and 2005. … Just as in the glaciers described above, the retreat of the Eastern Tungnahryggsjökull from its LIA position was more intense during the first half of the 20th century, and in 1946 its snout was only 200 m from its current position.”

Conclusion: Abrupt Arctic Warming, Cooling, Ice Melt Uncorrelated With CO2 Emissions

Implicit in the alarmist projection that rapid Arctic warming and ice melt will raise sea levels by 19 to 25 centimeters during the next 8 decades is the assumption that the Arctic’s post-1990s warming trend and ice melt has been driven by anthropogenic CO2 emissions — which are expected to continue to rise without dramatic energy policy changes.  However, this assumption ignores the nearly 100 years (1900 to mid-1990s) of non-correlation between CO2 emissions and the Arctic climate.
Succinctly, during the 1920s to 1940s period the (a)  Arctic warmed rapidly (~3°C per decade), the (b) Greenland ice sheet melted rapidly, and the (c) glacier melt contribution to sea level rise was explosive.  This occurred while anthropogenic CO2 emissions were both flat and negligible (10 times smaller than today’s emissions).
Then, just as CO2 emissions began to rise at an accelerated pace after 1940, the (a) Arctic cooled (for nearly 60 years), the (b) Greenland ice sheet surface mass balance was positive with a “null” contribution to sea level rise (1940-2000), and (c) the Arctic-wide ice melt contribution to sea level rise abruptly decelerated.
For the 110 years between 1900 and 2010, the Greenland ice sheet contributed just 0.6 of an inch (1.5 cm) to sea levels despite a 10-fold increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions during that period.  Therefore, the very mechanism (human CO2 emissions) assumed to be driving a projected 19 to 25 centimeters of Arctic ice melt contribution has not been observed to be a driving mechanism previously.
The observational evidence indicates that variations in anthropogenic CO2 emissions do not drive Arctic warming (or cooling), ice sheet surface mass balance, or sea level rise from retreating glaciers.

 followed by cheers
 But then came silence
 and then denial,
 Followed by downplaying
 Today, outrage is exploding
That’s the story of Germany’s attempted Energiewende (transition to renewable energies).
The mood has turned 180° since the early days. Once welcome, Germany’s Energiewende is now being met with shock and outrage as the envoiornmental destruction takes on unforeseen dimensions.
Even German envivonrmentalists, once huge proponents of renewable energies like wind and solar, are no longer able to take it any more as the Energiewende ravages the country’s environment and turns the notion of environmental protection into a fiasco.
Hat-tip: Alessandra Eck and Martina Knoedl at FB.
Now that Germany’s Energiewende has been in full swing for a number of years, many leading environmentalists are in a state of shock as huge areas of the country are being deforested and landscapes disfigured to make way for hundreds of wind turbines.
Environmentalist Georg Etscheit is a regular contributor at Germany’s leading climate alarmism site, Klimaretter, and he as well has had enough. Etscheit will be releasing a book in early November.

New, soon-to-be released book slams Germany’s Energiewende: “Sacrificed Landscapes – How the Energiewende Is Destroying our Landscapes.” Image: Heyne Verlag.
The title of the book: “Sacrificed Landscapes – How the Energiewende Is Destroying our Landscapes.” 
In the book’s promotion video here, a number of Germany’s leading environmental experts are seen denouncing Germany’s Energiewende, as they are aghast at what is going on.
Prof. Dr. Niko Paech, sustainability scientist, says:
What’s awful about the destruction of the landscapes and the government is that all of it has a legitimization.”
and
The German Energiewende has become a justification for destroying our last remaining natural landscapes.”
Dr. Gerhard Gronauer, pastor:
Climate protection that uses technical means against nature is a contradiction in itself.”

“Greatest fraud project”
Jörg Rehmann, journalist and author:
If we want to survive on this planet, we need an Energiewende. But what the policymakers have made of it is not an Energiewende, rather it is the greatest fraud project since the end of the second world war.”
Prof. Dr. Niko Paech, later adds:
Science is legitimizing a rampage against nature. We destroy the landscape while we claim it is serving the ecology. It’s a cannibalism by the measures. Climate protection is the aim that justifies the means to destroy all other remaining environmental media.”
Jörg Rehmann adds:
Serious science has long proven that the Energiewende cannot in any way reach its targets. Society has to bear billions in costs, already energy prices are exploding, and policymakers are driving us further into a nuthouse in the clouds.”

Image cropped from promotion video, Heyne Verlag. 
Rehmann continues and says the proponents are decieving the public into thinking it’s a green free-market capitalism. Paech reminds that despite all the destruction and money, no CO2 has been saved.
“No climate goals have been reached despite the billions invested,” says Rehmann.
Unprecedented amount of cronyism
Rehmann piles on even more:
Under the guise of a planned economy, there is now an unprecedented amount of cronyism and wasted money. It is shocking how far into a legal gray zone communities have gone with respect to the permitting in natural areas. It really reeks of corruption.”
Prof. Dr. Werner Nohl says that wind parks have no place in natural environments.
At the end Etscheit calls for an immediate stop to the “landscape and nature-destroying project” and that a whole new discussion needs to be taken up again.
My feeling is that the zeitgeist is right, and this book will do very well. It needs to be written in English (soon!) so that it can reach an international audience and hopefully help prevent the German blunder from being repeated elsewhere. -PG

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe DPA German press agency reported yesterday on the rapidly spreading energy poverty now engulfing the country.
The main driver is Germany’s skyrocketing electricity prices – primarily due to the legally mandatory feeding-in of wind and solar power. Currently regular household consumers are paying nearly 30 cents a kilowatt-hour – almost three times the rate paid in the USA.

Germany’s energy poverty. Over 330,000 German households saw their electric power service cut off in 2015. Photo cropped here.  
Back to the 19th century
Many households are no longer able to afford electricity and are seeing themselves catapulted back to the 19th century. According to t-online.de here, “More than 330,000 households in Germany have seen their electricity cut off over the past year alone.”
The German site writes that those hit the hardest are households on welfare, i.e. society’s poorest and most vulnerable.

German politician Eva Bulling-Schröter of the Left Party has called it “a silent catastrophe“.
Not only have the poor been broadsided by the high electricity prices, but so have energy intensive industries. This all makes many average workers uneasy. Over the past years a number of German plants have been moving their operations to less expensive locations abroad, especially in the chemical industry. Traditional power companies have also been getting creamed, seeing billions of losses and thousands of layoffs.
6.2 million threats to cut off service were made!
T-online cites the German Bundesnetzagentur, adding that in 2015 also 44,000 households saw their natural gas turned off. T-online adds that millions more have been threatened with the loss of electric power: “Power cut-offs were threatened 6.2 million times. The average outstanding amount that electricity providers demanded from the impacted households was 119 euros.”
According to Bulling-Schröter: “Energy poverty in Germany is a silent catastrophe for millions of people, especially in the cold and dark winter months.”
T-online.de calls letting hundreds of thousands of “children, the elderly, and the sick” go without power while the country posts record electricity exports an “injustice” and that the German government “does not want to see the energy poverty” that is rampant throughout the country.

Share this...FacebookTwitterProf. Fritz Vahrenholt was interviewed by Switzerland-based Basler Zeitung concerning Germany’s ‘Energiewende’ (transition to renewable energies), and energy issues in Switzerland, on February 18, 2017.

Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt. Image credit: GWPF
Vahrenholt was once the head of RWE’s renewable energy arm, Innogy, and responsible for the installation of offshore wind parks. However, after years of poor performance, discovering that the climate science was unclean, and learning of the harm wind parks pose to the environment, Vahrenholt has since been calling for a fundamental energy policy course correction in Germany.
Vahrenholt has called the German Energiewende “a disaster” so far, foremost because the supply of wind and sun is far too unstable and that everyone knows by now that it cannot work.
He also thinks Germany is making a huge mistake in the decision to phase out nuclear power, and calls Switzerland’s decision to keep nuclear power online “wise”.
The German professor also reminds that adding more capacity will not solve any of the supply problems: “No, even if we triple wind energy capacity, power generation will remain near zero when the wind stops blowing. The situation is similar for solar energy, especially at night. Solar energy only works full time 8% of the year.”
No viable storage technology
Tripling capacity would also result in chaos on windy and sunny days, Vahrenholt explains. On such days, with a tripled capacity, so much power would surge into the power grid that the surplus power would have to be given away, or “sold at negative prices”:
When too much power is fed in, grid operators order wind parks to shut down — yet they continue to be paid even when they do not produce. That is now costing one billion euros a year, and that is indeed absurd!”
Vahrenholt reiterates that sun and wind will not function until a solution is found for the storage problem. Currently no large-scale solution is anywhere near in sight. Dumping surplus power into the power grids of neighboring countries only wreaks havoc in those countries. Already countries are installing so-called phase shifters to keep surplus energy from the German grid from spilling uncontrollably into neighboring power networks, Vahrenholt explains.
Also a topic of the interview was the rising price of electricity for end consumers, which has seen German power become at near 30 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour among the world’s most expensive.

Vahrenholt says that policymakers made great errors in implementing wind and solar power, stating that storage technology should have been first developed. “We shouldn’t put the cart before the horse.”

For the time being, many energy-intensive industries in Germany have been exempted from having to pay the feed-in tariffs that are passed on to consumers. This leaves the regular private consumers to pick up the tab. But there is the risk that industry will soon be called on to pay their fair share. Vahrenholt adds:
One does not invest in a country when he/she is not sure how energy prices will develop. In addition to the price, supply stability also plays an important role. It decreases with every new wind turbine.”
“Enormous” impact on wildlife
Vahrenholt also points out the wind turbines are a real hazard to endangered wildlife: “The impacts on the biosphere of plants and animals are enormous.”
And why aren’t environmentalists and Green Party politicians being more vocal against wind turbines? Here Vahrenholt says that years ago they made the Energiewende the centerpiece of their platform. “In reality in Germany they were never an environmental party, but rather an anti-capitalist party that dedicated itself to protesting nuclear power and industry.”
Green energy for the urban elite
Yet, Vahrenholt sees “an enormous citizens’ protest potential” that reminds him of the anti-nuclear power industry from decades ago. He summarizes:
The dream of the urban elite of a supposedly clean energy supply is being realized on the backs of the rural population, who are losing their homeland.”
All in all Vahrenholt says green energies have been a real bonanza for rich property owners, and a real financial burden on the poor. He believes that the current development cannot be sustained and that it will need to be corrected: “At the latest when the first power grid failure occurs.” and that, “The longer it takes, the greater the difficulties will be.”

"It’s almost funny – the start of a comedian’s dark, sardonic joke in an Edinburgh fringe show. We are in the midst of a climate emergency, witnessing firsthand the results of carbon emissions reaching record highs – and yet if you want to make your way from London to the Scottish capital this summer, you’re incentivised to travel in the most unsustainable way. The problem is, there’s no punchline. Taking a flight from London to Edinburgh results in 193kg of CO2 emissions; opting for the train means you produce 24kg – that’s 87% less. But as I compared both prices and travel times for my journey, opting for air travel was not only quicker, it also cost much less. Later in the year I’d like to visit a friend in Barcelona: I can fly in November for £37; train travel is more than £250.  The British population is now increasingly concerned about the climate crisis and its catastrophic consequences, so there must be a better way to encourage us all to make travel choices that help reduce our carbon footprints than relying on a personal sense of guilt. Money is limited for almost everybody – and the pressure to work to earn that money means that your time is limited, too. Consequently, the desire to save the world from self-destruction isn’t always enough for us to make the most ethical decision. That’s why the burden has to be shared. Some solutions are simple: state intervention to nationalise the railways and further subsidise prices would be a start. Meanwhile, banning all non-essential domestic flights within England, Scotland and Wales is common sense thinking. Simply increasing taxes on air travel isn’t going far enough. Restricting flight numbers might initially sound drastic, but with 8% of global emissions coming from travel, and the sector set to grow at 4% per year internationally, there is no other choice. Drink-driving might be the most convenient form of transport for the person at the wheel, but as a society we’ve come to accept this restriction on our travel liberty given the harm it does. Why should unnecessary internal air travel be any different?  Restricting internal flights is, however, only a part of the solution – other elements are a little more complex. Even if train travel was made more affordable, there’s no escaping the fact it takes longer to travel by rail. From London to Edinburgh, that might only be an hour or two one you’ve factored in check-in, security and travel to the airport. But for longer distances the difference can be days. The flight time to Barcelona is just over two hours, yet it’s more than 11 hours to Barcelona on the train each way. For those with permanent employment, limited annual leave days are precious; self-employed people and those on zero-hours contracts rarely have designated holiday time at all. So you not only pay more money for the train, you also pay more in terms of leave taken. Who wants to waste time cooped up on a carriage when you could be exploring Florence or sunning yourself on a Barcelona beach? But when a single return flight to Berlin clocks up the same amount of carbon as 13 return trips by train, we have to find a way. It’s why employers must also take on some of the burden. Schemes such as Climate Perks, being rolled out by climate action organisation 10:10, offer a taste of what could be done. Its research found that 50% of people say they are ready to reduce the amount they fly in response to the climate crisis – but only 3% of us actually act on that impulse. They’re encouraging employers to offer paid “journey days” on top of annual holiday allowances when employees opt to travel sustainably: if you’re prepared to help save the planet, employers should pledge to support you. “Climate Perks employers show the world that they aren’t just ahead of the curve on flight-free travel, they’re bending it in the right direction,” Emma Kemp, a 10:10 campaigner, explained to me. “The more people that make a planet-friendly choice for their next holiday, the quicker we’ll reach the low-carbon destination we all want.” Of course, travel is only one part of the global climate crisis, but it’s an area in which we can – with relatively little action – radically reduce the harm being done. To do so will require state intervention and employers making adjustments, and yes – we might have to briefly embrace our inner Michael Portillo when it comes to spending time sitting on trains. • Michael Segalov is a contributing editor at Huck magazine, a freelance journalist and author"

Some may be asking what remains ahead for Europe over the next few months: Can we expect more warm summerlike weather, or should we expect a chilly fall?
Looking at the NOAA CFSv2 weather model for the coming 3 months, signs point to a colder than normal season (click to enlarge).

What’s behind the frigid forecast? Schneefan explains:
At the end of August in Eastern Siberia there was an unusual snowfall, which led to widespread power outages and the enactment of a state of emergency.
Early snowfall in Siberia often indicates a higher likelihood of harsher European winters. Do keep in mind, however, that seasonal forecasts are fraught with much uncertainty.
Another factor that bodes ill is that solar activity has since entered into a quiet phase. Studies have shown that European winters tend to be harsher during periods of low solar activity.
Arctic sea ice “death spiral” dies
Arctic sea ice area is currently at the mean of the past decade or so. This means that Arctic sea ice has pretty much stabilized at a low level and does not show signs of shrinking further over the mid-term. The once claimed Arctic sea ice “death spiral” has lost its life.
Greenland snow and ice mass “embarrassment”
Joe Bastardi at the latest Weatherbell Analytics Saturday Summary also looks at the situation in Greenland, which has not been getting any mention from the global warming weather-ambulance-chasing alarmists lately.

In his video, the 40-year veteran meteorologist says Greenland snow and ice mass balance is “way, way, way above normal” and that it is the “climate story nobody is talking about it because it’s an embarrassment given what was being said two years ago, really“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterCold German October
Germany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) weather service reports the preliminary weather data for October. At a mean of 8.6°C, the month came in 0.6°C colder than normal (compared to the 1981-2010 mean) and even came in 0.4°C colder than the 1961-1990 mean.
The DWD hints that natural variability factors are to blame for the cool month, writing:
An unusually strong high pressure area in October 2016 blocked the train of Atlantic lows towards Eastern Europe.
The October mean was calculated from data collected from Germany’s approximately 2000 weather stations across the country. October 2016 was also wetter and less sunny than normal.
Cold and cloudy in Austria
The situation was similar over Germany’s southeastern neighbor, Austria. The Austrian ZAMG weather service writes here that the Alpine country saw a much cloudier than normal month with a mean temperature 0.4°C below the 1981-2010 mean:

Several cold snaps provided for wintery conditions especially at higher elevations. Austria had experienced a string of warmer-than-normal months, but that streak has ended. Already there are signs that November may be colder than normal as well.
Near record northern hemisphere snow cover
The wetteronline site here just reported that for this time of the year “snow cover in the northern hemisphere reached the second highest level in about 50 years“. Snow cover has extended to 31.48 million square meters. Only 1976 was higher. Over the past few days a vast area of Russia has seen temperatures fall well below normal. Because of the early and widespread snow cover , the air cools and results in significantly colder than normal temperatures.
What does this mean for the coming weeks? Wetteronline reports the massive snow cover will likely have consequences for Europe and North America. Widespread snow cover over northern Asia can lead to the formation of a powerful cold high system over Siberia, which in turn can weaken the polar vortex. The result:
The weaker it becomes, the more probable it becomes that there will be blasts of polar air over Central Europe.”
This was also the case over the past winters, yet Europe escaped with mild winters.
“Snowiest winter on record”
Not only Central Europe could be slammed by cold winters due to massive snow cover over Russia, also Eastern North America could get hit as well according to Weather Underground here. The site writes that some Siberian locations have seen “their snowiest winter on record“. Weather Underground reports that the current conditions for producing a hard winter “are the best they’ve been in years“.

" Josh Frydenberg’s eligibility to sit in parliament has been challenged in the court of disputed returns by a constituent who says he feels “betrayed” by the Liberal party’s inaction on climate change. Michael Staindl, a resident of Kooyong, filed a petition on Wednesday alleging the treasurer and deputy Liberal leader is disqualified by section 44(1) of the constitution because he is a citizen of Hungary, which Frydenberg denies. The allegation on the final day for petitions to be filed against the 2019 election results came on top of two challenges against Liberal MP Gladys Liu in Chisholm and Frydenberg over Chinese language signs that told voters “the correct voting method” was to put a “1” next to the Liberal candidate. Those challenges were brought by Naomi Hall and independent candidate for Kooyong, Oliver Yates. The petitions – seen by Guardian Australia – are the first eligibility challenges of the new parliament, after the 45th parliament was rocked by 14 MPs or senators resigning or being ruled ineligible due to dual citizenship. If successful they could trigger byelections in Kooyong, won by Frydenberg with 55.7% of the two-party preferred vote, and Chisholm, won by Liu with 50.57%. Frydenberg’s mother was born in Hungary in 1943, and he has declared she held Hungarian citizenship from 1943 to 1948, but Frydenberg has denied that he holds citizenship by descent, citing legal advice from Hungarian citizenship law experts, which he has not released. Staindl told Guardian Australia he had “known Josh for many years” and decided to bring the challenge because “I’ve been trying to get action on climate change and he makes you feel well heard but I think he’s consistently betrayed me, the electorate and the country on climate change”. “In the last parliament he gave assurances [of action on the issue] that weren’t convincing to me at all,” he said. “And as our legislator, I think he owes us better integrity than that. [Frydenberg] should show us he’s entitled to sit.” Staindl is an IT professional who has volunteered for Melbourne-based environmental group Lighter Footprints. Frydenberg has previously rejected the claim of dual citizenship, arguing “it is absurd to think that I could involuntarily acquire citizenship of a foreign country from a stateless mother and grandparents – it invokes the North Korean example of conferring citizenship on someone against their will”. Frydenberg has cited immigration entry documents from 1950 that describe his mother as stateless and has argued that his mother is not a Hungarian citizen and that he cannot be by descent. But Staindl’s petition claims Frydenberg’s mother “arrived in Australia in 1950 in possession of a valid passport, inferred to be a valid Hungarian passport”. It claimed Frydenberg’s mother “continued to be a citizen of Hungary after 1948”, making him a citizen by descent. The challenges by Hall and Yates argue the Chinese-language signs were “likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote” in breach of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Hall’s petition notes that more than 20% of voters in Chisholm speak Mandarin or Cantonese at home and are likely to be able to read Chinese; in Kooyong the figure is about 12%. The case argues that as a consequence of the signs some voters were likely to have voted 1 for Liu “notwithstanding that such was not the vote that they otherwise intended to cast”. “Had it been the elector’s intention to direct his or her first preference to a candidate other than Liu, that intention was not realised,” the petition said. On election day Liu defended the signs, telling Sky News they were “good signs” authorised by the party. The acting state Liberal director, Simon Frost, has told Guardian Australia the signs were “properly authorised as required by the Commonwealth Electoral Act”. The Australian Electoral Commission inspected the signs on election day and concluded they were authorised. It concluded they were not misleading or deceptive, relying on a high court precedent that the prohibition is limited to the process of filling in a ballot paper, not influencing how voters formed their decision. Earlier in July, Victorian lawyer Trevor Poulton – who has written a novel called The Holocaust Denier but says he is not antisemitic – said he was considering a challenge against Frydenberg on the basis of alleged dual citizenship. On 18 July, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was asked about that putative challenge and accused Poulton of seeking to advance an antisemitic agenda “by pretending to have some sort of constitutional purity on Josh Frydenberg”. At that time Frydenberg said the citizenship issues “were dealt with comprehensively through the last parliament, and the Coalition is confident that none of its members or senators have issues in that regard”. “No one should deny what was an appalling and tragic event in world history,” he said. Staindl said he noted “with great alarm and grief that whenever this issue is raised [Frydenberg] raised the Holocaust denier cannons and fires in every direction”. “This has nothing to do with denial of the Holocaust, it is simply a matter of whether he is an Australian citizen only.” Staindl said if Frydenberg shows evidence he is not Hungarian he could drop the case, “otherwise, yes, I’ll see it through”."

I’ve decided to upgrade it as a post below. Both stories show that today’s climate is well within the range of our climate’s natural variability over the past 100 and 1000 years, and that today’s weather events aren’t unusual.

================================================
Washington DC Cherry Blossoms, By David Reich
This [Grape Harvest Date Evidence: No Significant Modern Warmth] reminds me of the Washington Post (WaPo) story that ran a story a few days ago about the earlier than normal Washington DC cherry blossoms hitting their “peak day”. It was stated by the National Park Service that the blossoms are now blooming “on average about 5 days earlier than normal” since records have been kept by NPS.
So, I went back and checked the data. Turns out that the data have been kept for 96 years going back to 1921. The average day of hitting “peak” during the decade of the 1920’s was day 93 into the year – April 3 in a non-leap year, April 2 in a leap year. The average in this decade so far is………92 days. So, how does the Park Service come up with “about 5 days”?
If you average all 96 days, you do get close to 94 days largely because during the 1950’s and 1960’s, the peak date in those 2 decades was over 97 days. So, the recent data is only 2 days earlier than the average. BUT, since the 50’s and 60’s decades which many people remember, the average has in fact gone down about 5 days. Of course no mention that the average went up from 93 days in the 1920’s to 97 in the 1950’s and 1960’s.
Equally egregious with both the WaPo article and also the NPS claim is the complete ignoring of the fact that the standard deviation of all 96 data points is well over 7 days (1990 was the earliest peak at day 74 while 1958 was the latest at day 108) so the data varies wildly. So, even if a 5 day trend were valid, such a trend is well within the normally expected variation in the “peak” day and is thus no trend. No change.
Nothing but lies and statistical manipulation by the WaPo and the NPS.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterElectric car proponents keep insisting that breakthroughs in electric car battery technology are just around the corner, and that soon electric cars will no longer be hampered by limited range and long charging times. Thus we should start banning internal combustion cars soon.
Leading experts, on the other hand, are far less optimistic about the prospects of battery powered vehicles. For example, the online Badische Neueste Nachrichten (BNN) here presents an interview with Prof. Albert Albers, Director for Product Development at the German Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT), where he researches vehicle and machinery drive systems.
Too much green populism
Albers says he is annoyed by media and policymakers who insist electric batteries are feasible, and who cite “phony experts” who do not know the subject material very well. The result he tells the BNN:
For this reason the citizens instead get too few facts and too many populist opinions.”
Battery’s huge ecological fingerprint
On the subject of electric cars and batteries, he notes that the ecological fingerprint of an e-car with battery “is not so good at all“, reminding readers that after everything gets calculated, “the ecological expenditure is 60 percent higher than that of a combustion engine auto.”
According to Albers, the driver first has to run the vehicle 80,000 km before it catches up to the internal combustion engine, a point where the lifetime of the battery is pretty much exhausted, he says.
No manufacture today is ready to guarantee a battery for 200,000 km (10 years) which is what is normal for regular combustion engines.”

Pleads for a return to sobriety
On the future for electric mobility, Albers pleads for a return to sobriety, saying that by 2030 there’s going to be “significantly more internal combustion vehicles on the roads than today”, and that for this reason “it is highly dangerous when policymakers villainize a technology.”
Despite all the anti-diesel rhetoric now being loudly expressed in Germany, Albers thinks the diesel engine still has a future, because there is still room for much improvement in diesel combustion technology.
“Considerable” fire and short circuit risks
The Karlsruhe researcher doesn’t believe there is future for batteries as a widespread solution, citing that the infrastructure challenges are too great and that there’s a “considerable risk” of short circuits involved with the use of lithium cells.
Overall Albers believes that “we have to remain open” to all solutions, for example synthetic fuels, power-to liquid-technology, or hydrogen gas powered engines. He does see a use for battery technology, but  in certain niche markets.
Albers says a more rational solutions-oriented discussion needs to take place, and there’s a need to get away from the generation of attention grabbing “populist headlines”.
800,000 German automotive jobs at risk
We must not discuss the issue in a state of daily panic and campaign populism and put the 800,000 jobs of the German automobile industry at risk.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhysicist Dr. Peter Heller wrote at the German language Science Skeptical here how the election of Donald Trump could mean “the return to reason in climate policy” and that there may be a course change: “one away from trying to do what’s good for the climate, to one that does what is good for man.”

Physicist Dr. Peter Heller. Photo: FDP
He writes:
This is neither dangerous nor unscientific – rather it is optimistic. It holds the promise for a better future that offers more than just the energy savings variant of the present.”
Heller views both opposite extreme positions taken by the radical elements on either side of the debate as irreconcilable and are in fact “nonsense that have more to to do with belief than with science.”
Heller then adds that if the climate alarmists had their way, they “would not only destroy our current prosperity, but also rob mankind of all options to further prosper in the future.”
Today Heller sees hope for a return to reason in climate policy given the “current developments“. One reason for hope he cites is the recently watered down Climate Plan 2050 submitted by the German government at the recent Climate Conference in Morocco. Ultimately Germany was not ready to deindustrialize after all. Heller believes:
Thirty years of climate diplomacy where tens of thousands of taxpayer-funded politicians, bureaucrats and scientists jetted to large conferences and congresses at attractive touristic locations were useless. […] After the election Donald Trump to President of the United States, the gate for better policy has finally opened endlessly wide.”
In his analysis Heller of course agrees that man has an impact on climate and that the greenhouse effect is real, but that this does not necessarily mean climate change is climate catastrophe. He thinks climate sensitivity is closer to 1°C per doubling of CO2. He calls the claims that climate is only worsening “pure speculation” and the claim that man-made climate change is taking us to a climate catastrophe is based on “numerous assumptions“.

Heller also thinks that human ingenuity with respect to adapting to new conditions is being hugely underestimated, reminding readers that humans have adapted to and mastered every climate zone on the planet.
Even in regions where there are frequent drought periods, powerful storms or flooding, man did not retreat. His ingenuity overcame all obstacles. The temperature range within which civilization spread went far beyond the range of 2°C.”
As part of this adaptation, Heller calls fossil energies “a moral necessity” because we use them to generate our prosperity and to produce products of every type that benefit our lives.
In many applications they are indispensable and some are not so easily replaceable, as the 2°C target demands. In summary their advantages substantially outweigh their disadvantages. […] Fossil fuels not freed humanity from feudal exploitation and slavery because they provide an efficient and effective supply through machines, they have foremost enabled us to refrain from consuming biomass as a form of energy and thus prevented the destruction of the environment. In the 18th century when charcoal was substituted by coke in iron smelting, forests once again were able to expand.”
Heller sees Donald Trump as a “new start”, someone who will expand the production of fossil fuels and end the climate protection policy of Obama, and thus with it usher in a series of economic, social and political advantages.
This could introduce the end of international climate diplomacy in its current form, as countries like Russia, China or India are also poised for a reorientation.”
The German physicist calls the howls and gnashing of teeth now taking place within the German mainstream media “over-the-top and wrong”.
He summarizes:
From the very beginning it was a fundamental mistake by climate policy to allow political activists from climate research to have the say. Donald Trump’s program puts the setting of guidelines where it really belongs: in a policymaking that that does not focus on the welfare of the climate, but rather on the welfare on mankind. Climate protection through decarbonization does not offer anything to anyone. In the end even its proponents are left with nothing except a good feeling.”

"Mining company Glencore could be forced to only sell coal from a new mine in New South Wales to signatories of the Paris climate agreement, under a proposal floated by the state’s independent planning commission. Opposed by Glencore and its joint-venture partner in the mine, Peabody, the condition would see approval of the Wambo open-cut coalmine in the state’s Hunter Valley linked to the countries it exports to. But the proposal has prompted a mixed response from environment groups. While some have argued linking the coal mine’s approval to global emissions is positive, others say merely restricting exports to signatories to the Paris agreement will not have any meaningful impact because virtually every country has signed up to the agreement. In a statement, the NSW independent planning commission said it was considering approving the mine under the condition Glencore prepared an export management plan showing how it would “use its best endeavours” to ensure any coal extracted from the mine only be exported to signatories to the Paris deal, or to countries that have similar policies in place aimed at minimising greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of the condition, the commission said, “is to ensure that all practicable measures are adopted by the applicant to minimise greenhouse gas emissions”. The proposal document circulated by the planning commission fails to distinguish between signatories to the Paris agreement and those that have actually ratified it; when it was negotiated in 2015 the Paris accord was signed by 195 countries covering most of the Earth’s greenhouse emissions. While the Lock the Gate Alliance said the group supported the proposal, the Environment Defenders Officer said the proposal was “flawed” because it assumed countries which had ratified the Paris agreement would meet climate abatement targets; under current commitments, the world is on track for more than 3C of global heating, well beyond what was promised in the Paris agreement. The EDO’s chief executive, David Morris, said the group was considering the “legal validity” of the condition, but that it was flawed because it was underpinned by “two factual inaccuracies”. “Many countries that have signed the Paris Agreement, on current trajectories, will fail to achieve their existing commitments,” he said. “Even if all signatories did meet their existing commitments, the world will warm far more than the goal set in Paris to limit the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees. “That is, despite the fact that most countries are signatories to, and have ratified, the Paris Agreement, there remains a huge disconnect between countries’ Paris Commitments and achieving the Goals of the Paris Agreement. “Also, given that the vast majority of countries have either signed or ratified the Paris Agreement, the proposed condition will do very little to change the business as usual approach to the mitigation of emissions from coal exports.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The planning commission’s proposal comes seven months after the chief judge of the state’s land and environment court, Brian Preston, dismissed an appeal by mining company Gloucester Resources over the controversial Rocky Hill open-cut coking coal mine 5km outside of the town of Gloucester in the state’s Hunter Valley, in part because of its impact on climate change. While that decision did not set a legal precedent, Georgina Woods from the Lock the Gate Alliance said the decision had “opened the door” for the commission to consider the global emission implications of an approval on a coalmine. “I think that basically the commission has been grappling with what it can and should do in the wake of Rocky Hill and this is them trying to find a position on what is in their power to do,” she said. “I think it’s positive that, rather than the commission taking at face value what Glencore is saying about its impact on emissions, it’s actually making that a legal requirement of its approval. “The condition they have proposed does need augmenting to recognise that simply being a member of the Paris agreement doesn’t in and of itself achieve what the commission is seeking to achieve, but it is significant because it is the first time ever that the approval of a mine in NSW would be tied to the global effort to reduce global greenhouse emissions.” Woods said that if Glencore was forced to develop an export management plan, it should be “dynamic”. “What we will be arguing is that the management plan needs to have an annual review plan. The Paris agreement is an instrument that recognises mitigation needs to be dynamic and something that increases over time. The commitments are not static so neither can any emissions management.” Glencore and Peabody argue that the condition should not be imposed because the most likely buyers of the coal were already Paris signatories. In a lengthy submission, it also argued against linking the mine with emissions from coal exported to a foreign country, as proposed by environment groups in the wake of the Gloucester decision. The buyers, the companies argued, were “ultimately responsible” for emissions. “[E]missions generated by the combustion of the project’s coal should not outweigh the significant social and economic benefits that the project will deliver at a local, regional and state level,” it said in a submission to the commission."

Observational evidence indicates that Antarctic sea ice has been advancing in recent decades, a trend that has puzzled climate modelers who assume that a warming globe will inhibit sea ice growth.  About 86% of all climate models have indicated that sea ice would show a declining trend for Antarctica, and just 14% (1 out of every 7) concluded sea ice extent would advance.  The average observed growth has been +1.29 (x 105 km2/decade) during the satellite era (since 1979), whereas the models projected a decline of -3.36  (x 105 km2/decade) on average.
Shu et al., 2015 

Forty-nine models, almost all of the CMIP5 climate models and earth system models with historical simulation, are used. For the Antarctic, multi-model ensemble mean (MME) results can give good climatology of sea ice extent (SIE), but the linear trend is incorrect. The linear trend of satellite-observed Antarctic SIE [sea ice extent] is +1.29 (±0.57) × 105 km2 decade−1 ; only about 1/7 CMIP5 models show increasing trends, and the [modeled] linear trend of CMIP5 MME is negative with the value of −3.36 (±0.15) × 105 km2 decade−1 .

Not willing to countenance the fact that their modeling was so terribly wrong, advocates of alarming anthropogenic global warming recently decided it was time to get creative in explaining why their modeling could still be quite right after all.  Of course, these advocates could not and would not admit that decades of growing sea ice trends would indicate that Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean have not been warming, but cooling, during the last 3 decades in concert with the facile principle that cooler surface waters allow more sea ice to form.
Ackley et al., 2015

Sea-ice growth and melt are determined by the heat balance between the OHF [ocean heat flux] and the conductive heat transfer through the overlying ice cover. … Low atmospheric temperatures drive sea-ice formation, while relatively high ocean temperatures that can limit ice growth are a principal cause of sea-ice melt in the Antarctic.

Acknowledging that the southern pole has been cooling since the 1980s would serve to undermine the paradigm that says the entire globe has been steadily warming due to human activity.  In other words, a cooling Antarctica and Southern Ocean doesn’t advance the cause.
So instead of acknowledging that Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean have been not been warming recently (as observational evidence clearly indicates), these advocates decided to issue a convoluted explanation about why sea ice grows in a warming world.  Well, in the Southern Hemisphere, anyway.  In the Northern Hemisphere, it is wholly accepted that warming causes sea ice to decline, which has been observed in the Arctic in recent decades.  In the Southern Hemisphere, warming causes sea ice to grow.  Confused?  We’re just getting started.
As mentioned, advocates of the position that human-caused global warming causes sea ice to grow in the Southern Hemisphere first deny that Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have been cooling in recent decades (despite the observational evidence).  Instead, they claim that the region has continued to warm, consistent with climate modeling and anthropogenic global warming expectations.  They then can claim that a warming Southern Ocean and Antarctic continent have led to enhanced land ice melt along the coasts of Antarctica.  This enhanced land ice melt has meant that the seas near the coasts have had new “cold, fresh layer” (from additional land ice meltwater) gliding over the surface of the ocean.  This “cold, fresh layer” of run-off water from enhanced land ice melt keeps the warming oceans from warming up too much, and this “cold, fresh layer” travels far and wide, suppressing the ability of the warming surface waters to limit sea ice growth.   In this way, the warming waters with a “cold, fresh layer” on top from all the additional land ice meltwater could be said to have caused the sea ice to grow.  Again, this process only works in the Southern Hemisphere.  It doesn’t work in the Northern Hemisphere, where the enhanced land ice melt in the Arctic does not result in sea ice growth, but a dramatic sea ice decline.
Surely this convoluted, ad hoc “explanation” for why anthropogenic global warming causes sea ice growth would not be taken seriously.  Right?  Well, actually, it has been taken very seriously.  No less than the journal Nature embraced it.  NSIDC’s director Mark Serreze promoted this makeshift conceptualization too.  And, of course, the usual suspects in the print media were all to eager to agree that human CO2 emissions cause sea ice to grow in Antarctica (and simultaneously shrink in the Arctic).
Nature News, 2013

Global warming expands Antarctic sea ice: In a polar paradox, melting land ice helps sea ice to grow.
Ocean warming may be a major driver of sea-ice expansion in the Antarctic, researchers report today in Nature Geoscience. … Scientists have known for several years that meltwater from ice sheets can form a cold, fresh layer on the ocean surface that protects sea ice from the warmer waters below. … “The paradox is that global warming leads to more cooling and more sea ice around Antarctica,” says Richard Bintanja, a climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in Utrecht.

UK Daily Mail (2014)

Global warming is creating MORE ice: Antarctic levels reach a record high because of climate change, scientists claim
Claim was made by Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre … Shift is caused by water melting from beneath the Antarctic ice shelves … Scientists claim it is then re-frozen back on surface, increasing sea ice

New Paper Debunks Claim That Humans Cause Antarctic Sea Ice To Advance
A new paper shreds this ad hoc explanation linking human activity to sea ice growth in the Southern Hemisphere.  Pauling et al. (2016) find that internal dynamics could explain the cooling and increase in sea ice extent in recent decades, and that an enhancement of the “freshwater input by an amount within the range of estimates of the Antarctic mass imbalance did not have any significant effect on either sea ice area magnitude or trend” — even if one assumes that anthropogenic forcing causes a decline in sea ice to offset the hypothetical growth trend due to enhanced “freshwater input”.
Pauling et al., 2016
The possibility that recent Antarctic sea ice expansion resulted from an increase in freshwater reaching the Southern Ocean is investigated here. … Two sets of experiments were conducted from 1980 to 2013 in CESM1(CAM5), one of the CMIP5 models, artificially distributing freshwater either at the ocean surface to mimic iceberg melt or at the ice shelf fronts at depth. An anomalous reduction in vertical advection of heat into the surface mixed layer resulted in sea surface cooling at high southern latitudes and an associated increase in sea ice area. Enhancing the freshwater input by an amount within the range of estimates of the Antarctic mass imbalance did not have any significant effect on either sea ice area magnitude or trend. 
A Better Explanation: Antarctica, Southern Ocean Have Been Cooling Since The 1980s
As mentioned above, Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have not been cooperating with anthropogenic “global” warming models.  The region has been cooling for decades.  And a cooling Southern Ocean has led to increasing sea ice trends.  In other words, no convoluted explanations are necessary.
Fan et al., 2014

[A]ll of these studies reported a close relationship between [sea ice extent] and sea surface temperature (SST) whereby sea ice gain is associated with lower SSTs and vice versa. … Cooling is evident over most of the Southern Ocean in all seasons and the annual mean, with magnitudes approximately 0.2–0.4°C per decade or 0.7–1.3°C over the 33 year period [1979-2011].

Doran et al., 2002

[O]ur spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000, particularly during summer and autumn.

Turner et al., 2016

Here we use a stacked temperature record to show an absence of regional [Antarctic Peninsula] warming since the late 1990s. The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer.


Jones et al., 2016

Over the 36-year satellite era, significant linear trends in annual mean sea-ice extent, surface temperature and sea-level pressure are superimposed on large interannual to decadal variability. Most observed trends, however, are not unusual when compared with Antarctic palaeoclimate records of the past two centuries. With the exception of the positive trend in the Southern Annular Mode, climate model simulations that include anthropogenic forcing are not compatible with the observed trends. This suggests that natural variability overwhelms the forced response in the observations, but the models may not fully represent this natural variability or may overestimate the magnitude of the forced response.



During 1950s – 1980s, Antarctica, Southern Ocean Warmed, And Sea Ice Declined
In the Northern Hemisphere, Arctic sea ice declines during warm phases (e.g., the 1920s to 1940s and the 1990s to present), and Arctic sea ice increases during cooling phases (like it did during the 1950s to 1980s).  Similarly, when the Southern Ocean and Antarctic continent warmed during the 1950s to 1980s, sea ice declined.  Since the 1980s, Antarctica and the Southern Ocean have cooled, and, consequently, sea ice area has grown.  Not only that, but a majority of East Antarctic glaciers have been advancing since the 1990s.  Again, no convoluted, ad hoc explanations are necessary.  Cooling contributes to ice growth trends, and warming contributes to declining ice trends.
IPCC (2001):

Another analysis of a 21-station data set from Antarctica by Comiso (1999) found a warming trend equivalent to 1.25°C per century for a 45-year record beginning in the 1950s but a slight cooling trend from 1979 to 1998. The slight cooling trend for this later 20-year period also was confirmed via analysis of surface temperatures over the whole continent, as inferred from satellite data.

Fan et al., 2014

[S]ea surface temperatures and surface air temperatures decreased during 1979–2011, consistent with the expansion of Antarctic sea ice. In contrast, the Southern Ocean and coastal Antarctica warmed during 1950–1978.

Sinclair et al., 2014

We present the first proxy record of sea-ice area (SIA) in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, from a 130 year coastal ice-core record. High-resolution deuterium excess data show prevailing stable SIA [sea ice area] from the 1880s until the 1950s, a 2–5% reduction from the mid-1950s to the early-1990s, and a 5% increase after 1993.

Miles et al., 2013

Despite large fluctuations between glaciers—linked to their size—three epochal patterns emerged: 63 per cent of glaciers retreated from 1974 to 1990, 72 per cent advanced from 1990 to 2000, and 58 per cent advanced from 2000 to 2010.  … Indeed, several studies report increasing sea-ice concentrations in the study region from approximately 1980 to 2010, which is consistent with the predominance of glacier advance since 1990, when above-average sea-ice and fast-ice concentrations could have suppressed calving by increasing back-pressure on glacier termini. In contrast, reduced sea ice concentrations from the 1950s to the mid 1970s are consistent with glacier retreat during the 1960s and 1970s, when air temperatures were also increasing along the Pacific coast.


Sea Ice Trends In Antarctica Are Incompatible With An Anthropogenic Or CO2 Influence
The reason why advocates of an alarming anthropogenic influence on climate are so intent on “explaining” why warming causes sea ice to grow in the Southern Hemisphere is simple: what has been observed with Antarctic sea ice undermines the claim that anthropogenic global warming is predominantly responsible for polar sea ice trends.  And the observation that Antarctica warmed during the 1950s to 1980s, when CO2 levels were in the “safe” range (under 350 ppm), but it has cooled since the 1980s as CO2 levels exploded past 400 ppm, is also very incompatible with the conclusion that humans determine the ice trends in the southern polar climate with their CO2 emissions.
Of course, what has been happening in Antarctica is entirely consistent with what would be expected with natural or internal variability, and not what would be expected from models of rapidly growing CO2 concentrations.
Latif et al., 2013

During phases of deep convection the surface Southern Ocean warms, the abyssal Southern Ocean cools, Antarctic sea ice extent retreats, and the low-level atmospheric circulation over the Southern Ocean weakens. After the halt of deep convection, the surface Southern Ocean cools, the abyssal Southern Ocean warms, Antarctic sea ice expands, and the low-level atmospheric circulation over the Southern Ocean intensifies, consistent with what has been observed during the recent decades. 

At some point it must be acknowledged that something is seriously wrong with climate models that presume anthropogenic influences dominate the trends in polar sea ice.  One wonders what the next makeshift “explanation” will be for a likely increase in Arctic sea ice extent at some point in the near future, or as the warming phase in the Arctic draws to a close in the coming years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterLittle Ice Age as a suitable reference point for the warming of the last 150 years?  The case of Mont Blanc
By Uli Weber
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On October 29 television station ARTE broadcast the documentary “Laboratory Mont Blanc“ (94 Min.). It’s available at Arte.tv until November 6, 2016.  The description at ARTE:
On a 6-day expedition three scientists climbed the Mont Blanc, which is considered the heart of the European Alps. At approximately 4810 meters tall the ‘white giant’ is a natural wonder of nature. Climbing the large mountain is a unique experience and is considered as a look at the past 240 million years of evolution…”
Of course the problem in the documentary all gets back to man-made climate change. Yet between the 37 minute and 45 minute marks, we found some rational documentation: The Mont Blanc glacier had retreated just as much during the Medieval times as much it has today. Back then a small town near what today is Chamonix (Le Chatelard?) was covered in 1643 by the Mer de Glace (sea of ice) glacier and destroyed. In 1860 – the end of the Little Ice Age – the Mer de Glace reached its greatest extent, which is documented by photos and other means.
Since then the Mer de Glace has been in retreat, as the following satellite photo from Google-Maps clearly shows:

Also other sources report of glacier advance during the Little Ice Age, e.g. the Blog History of Geology on October 8, 2016:
… In the year 1644 in the Mont Blanc region, a procession to the glacier was organized at the village Les Bois because supposedly it had advanced to only 120 meters away from the village and it was threatening. The bishop of Geneva blessed the Les-Bois-glacier personally…“
Wikipedia on the Mer de Glace, quote:
„… Earlier the glacier flowed over a steep part and into the valley of Chamonix, and right up to the settlement Les Bois. This part of the glacier was named the Glacier des Bois and used to be an attraction of old Chamonix. At the elevation of Montenvers the glacier used to be 130 meters thicker than today. Crossing the right bank was free of trouble. People even drove the herds of sheep over it…“
It is most astonishing that the mean temperature at the end of the Little Ice Age (usually 1850, but in the ARTE documentary 1860) gets misused as the “natural” yardstick for measuring our current warming, and thus used as proof of a “man-made” global warming – even though that it is clearly shown by the ARTE documentary and without a doubt as simply part of the ongoing natural cycle since the Medieval time.

"It’s my sad duty to inform you that the city of Sydney as we know it is set to be destroyed and replaced by the totalitarian spectre of a chilling dystopia. At least, that’s if you believe the Daily Telegraph’s latest reporting on the lord mayor Clover Moore’s 2050 vision. Moore has outlined a concept for how the city could look that year as part of the City of Sydney council’s broader move to make the city more sustainable.  Given the spectre of rising sea levels in a harbour city that has already declared a climate emergency, you would expect future planning to help mitigate the worst of these scenarios, if for no other reason than to help keep its spot on the most liveable city rankings. Instead, the Telegraph describes Moore’s future Sydney as a “wacky dystopian vision”. The City of Sydney Liberal councillor Christine Forster is quoted in the piece criticising Moore for “scaring children with alarmist rhetoric”, citing a feedback session that described children as being deeply anxious. Won’t someone think of the children? Not in a “handing them a better world” sense, of course, but at least coddle them until they inherit the worst of our sins. We really must figure out how to teach our children that their quality of life may be greatly reduced due to our inaction, but in a way that excites them. Perhaps Frozen 2 can be set in a steaming puddle or something. The Institute of Public Affairs, a thinktank partly funded by a mining giant and consistent in their unscientific denialism, are invited to pull up their diesel-fuelled clown car and spout off unchallenged, misleading statistics and claim the focus on climate change is “nonsense”. But, I’m afraid to say, the Telegraph is entirely correct. Clover Moore is building a dystopian world, which we shall call Cloverfield, in which Fahrenheit 451 is just the expected low temperature on a weather report for a spring day. What is this dystopian “radical climate agenda” that has frightened the Telegraph much more than the benign fact of Greenland rapidly melting away before our eyes? Well, unlike the atmosphere itself, the future Sydney can only be described as chilling. The Telegraph reports the vision for Sydney includes cars “banished underground” in a dramatic depiction of what some would call a tunnel. Renewables will power the city and single-use plastics will be banned. Will this ban be under pain of death? We can only assume yes. The poor, hapless residents will also be subjected to air conditioned “public urban cool rooms”, according to the report. This is pure Orwell. Who can forget the frightening moment in 1984 when poor Winston Smith is thrown into Room 101 only to be confronted by what he fears most: ducted air conditioning. Trains and light rail would be powered by renewable energy, urban farms would feed the city. On its face, this sounds like a great thing. Climate change is already driving global hunger and a major, growing city investing in its food security seems to have no downside. But you have to understand dystopian double speak. Urban farms? That’s clearly a thinly veiled guise for eating people. Moore may be an independent but this is a platform for the Soylent Greens. This is not a future we want. Sure, the government’s own modelling predicts higher temperatures and more extreme weather events, yet this is no reason to be frightened or even plan for this scenario. Rather, we should simply keep stumm and politely melt into the concrete. • James Colley is a comedian and writer for Gruen, Tomorrow Tonight and The Weekly.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman public radio DLF here  reports an astonishing finding by scientists: Global wind speeds globally are slowing down! 
A number of European scientist groups and a European science magazine of the EU Commission just reported on this.

Global wind speeds are slowing down, European researchers believe. Image: anemometer, NOAA public domain photo.
According to the researchers, worldwide wind speeds have slowed down by about half a kilometer per hour since the 1960s.
The phenomenon is known as “stilling”, and scientists are not sure why it is happening. They speculate that it may have something to do with urbanization, climate change and cumulus clouds. But then the report admits: “Or it could be due to ageing wind speed instruments producing inaccurate results.”
Normally this should come across as being good news amid the claims that “global warming” is leading to more powerful and destructive storms. With slower wind speeds, one would naturally assume less storm destruction.
But instead the researchers see only dark clouds ahead and warn that this could have “terrible consequences for things like agriculture” and that weak winds “also mean that smog over cities will stick around longer”. It adds:

And while it may sound deceptively calm, it could be a vital, missing piece of the climate change puzzle and a serious threat to our societies.”
We are damned no matter what happens.



Send more funding
Naturally there’s the thinly veiled call for MORE MONEY as University of Gothenburg climatologist Dr. Cesar Azorin-Molina “believes there is an urgent need to determine the causes of stilling in a changing climate“.
Ironically, another problem the report hints at is that wind farms may also see less output as a result. Now aren’t windfarms supposed to make the weather tamer in the first place? This is like blaming harsher winters for obstructing the fight against warming because people have to emit more CO2 to keep warm. maybe wind farms are a factor in slowing down winds as they extract energy from the wind.
Not surprisingly, the results of the researchers are getting only tiny blurbs of reporting in the media. For years people have been brainwashed into thinking man-made global warming is leading to stronger winds. But now they are supposed to believe the opposite is happening? The public must never hear that winds are calming down.
All the contradictions climate science has put out are starting to catch up and cast the field’s credibility into serious question.
The junk science never ceases to amaze us.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA new paper just published online asks a timely and poignant question as the U.S. Presidential election splatters the headlines this week: What does the Paris Agreement actually do?  The author succinctly answers his own question, concluding that the Paris Agreement allows countries like China and India “permission to emit as much [CO2] as they see fit,” and therefore the international pact “makes the policy of mitigation of global warming impossible.”
Campbell, 2016
What does the Paris Agreement actually do?
“Though very widely believed to be inadequate in the target it sets, the Paris Agreement is commonly thought actually to set a binding target of reducing global CO2e emissions so as to limit global warming to 2℃. Proper legal interpretation of the Agreement shows it to set no such target. It rather gives the newly industrialising countries such as China and India a permission to emit as much as they see fit. These countries have been principally responsible for the huge growth in emissions since 1990 and they will be responsible for their continued huge growth until 2030. The Paris Agreement therefore makes the policy of mitigation of global warming impossible. However, this policy has been impossible over the whole of the now more than a quarter century of international climate change policy.”
To expand on this point, consider that global-scale CO2 emissions were still only 6.5 gigatons per year (GtC/yr) in the year 1999, but they grew to 7.5 GtC/yr by 2005, 8.5 GtC/yr by 2008, and 10.1 GtC/yr by 2014.  Here’s what that explosive growth in CO2 emissions looks like:

 
Notice the exponential expansion in climate change mitigation laws and policies from 1997, 2009, and 2014, and how they are negatively correlated with global-scale CO2 emissions growth (source: London School of Economics).  In other words, the more laws are passed that attempt to mitigate the growth in CO2 emissions, the sharper the growth in CO2 emissions.
London School of Economics, 2015
Three-quarters of the world’s annual emissions of greenhouse gases are now limited by national targets
“53 countries, including the 28 Member States of the European Union, have national targets that set either absolute or relative limits on annual emissions of greenhouse gases across their economies. … 98 countries and the European Union together had 804 climate laws and policies at the end of 2014, compared with 426 in 2009, when a previous attempt was made in Copenhagen, Denmark, to reach an international agreement. In 1997, when the Kyoto Protocol was agreed, these countries had just 54 climate laws and policies between them. … 47 countries, including the 28 Member States of the European Union, have introduced carbon pricing through either a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system.”
According to an analysis by the Washington Post, Gigawatt-hours (GWh) from fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil) grew from 5.8 GWh in 1980 to 15.4 GWh in 2012.  Gigawatt-hours from renewables rose from 1.8 GWh in 1980 to 4.8 GWh in 2012.  This means that total consumption of fossil fuel energies grew more than 3 times faster than renewables did (9.6 GWh vs. 3 GWh) between 1980 and 2012.
Washington Post (2015):

As appetite for electricity soars, the world keeps turning to coal
“[T]wo-thirds of the world’s electricity is still produced by burning fossil fuels, mostly coal — a proportion that hasn’t budged for 35 years. Emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants have more than doubled since 1980 as the world’s demand for electricity keeps rising.”
And fossil fuel use will continue rising – no matter how many more laws are passed.
India and China alone plan to build 1617 new coal power plants by 2030.
Between 50 and 86 new coal plants are planned for Turkey in the next few years.
Russia plans to rapidly expand their coal industry (source):

“The Russian government has endorsed a long-term coal industry development program, featuring an increase in coal production and coal-powered generation – a day after adopting a brand-new climate action plan.   The refurbished program sees coal production in Russia increase to 410-480 million tons by 2030, and exports are expected to grow by some 70 million tons.”
Japan is currently building 43 new coal plants.
South Korea is also adding more coal-fired energy according to a report from Reuters.com:
“Less than a week since signing the global climate deal in Paris, Japan and South Korea are pressing ahead with plans to open scores of new coal-fired power plants, casting doubt on the strength of their commitment to cutting CO2 emissions.   Even as many of the world’s rich nations seek to phase out the use of coal, Asia’s two most developed economies are burning more than ever and plan to add at least 60 new coal-fired power plants over the next 10 years.  Officials at both countries’ energy ministries said those plans were unchanged.”
The Netherlands…
“Dutch energy companies are burning more coal than ever, despite efforts to produce more green and sustainable energy, according to research by news agency De Persdienst. It says coal-fired power stations in the Netherlands used over seven million kilos of coal in the first nine months of last year, a 15% increase on 2013 and a 36% increase on 2012.”
World Research Institute assesses that ten developing countries are or will be building new coal plants.
“New coal-fired plants have been proposed in 10 developing countries: Cambodia, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Laos, Morocco, Namibia, Oman, Senegal, Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan. Currently, there is limited or no capacity for domestic coal production in any of these countries.”
According to a report from The Guardian, the only two wealthy countries that did not expand coal production and consumption since 2009 are the United States and Canada.  For Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and the UK, coal consumption rose by 16% between 2009 and 2013.
“Britain, Germany, Italy, Japan and France together burned 16% more coal in 2013 than 2009 and are planning to further increase construction of coal-fired power stations. Only the US and Canada of the G7 countries meeting on Monday in Berlin have reduced coal consumption since the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009.”
The Paris Agreement was, is, and will be an exercise in futility.  It will not reduce global-scale CO2 emissions, as emissions rates will continue to grow on a net global scale, especially since Asian and Middle Eastern countries continue to “emit as much as they see fit”.
Analysts have suggested that our efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions “will almost surely fail,” and they may “actually make matters worse.”
Jones and Warner, 2016
Efforts to curtail world temps will almost surely fail
“To even come close to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, 50 percent of our energy will need to come from renewable sources by 2028, and today it is only 9 percent, including hydropower. For a world that wants to fight climate change, the numbers just don’t add up to do it.”
Kelly, 2016

“It is evident that UN efforts to combat climate change are not effective because past experience shows that CO2 generation cuts weren’t near enough.”

"The climate crisis could be making transatlantic flights more bumpy, according to research into the impact of global heating on the jet stream. Jet streams are powerful currents of air at the altitudes which planes fly. . They result from the air temperature gradient between the poles and the tropics, and reach speeds of up to 250mph (400kmph). They also sometimes meander.  Researchers say previous studies of the speed and location of the fastest part of the north Atlantic jet stream have found only small changes over time, although there are signs it is slowly shifting northward. Experts say the lack of dramatic alterations is because climate change produces competing effects at different altitudes. The latest study, however, took a different approach. “Just because the speed isn’t changing, doesn’t mean the jet stream isn’t changing in other ways,” said Prof Paul Williams of the University of Reading, co-author of the research. The study, published in the journal Nature, looked at the change in wind speed with height, known as vertical shear. “The higher up you go, the windier it gets,” he said. Using three different datasets based on satellite observations, the team say they identified a 15% increase in vertical shear between 1979 and 2017, consistent with what would be expected from climate change. “The winds and the temperatures are in a certain kind of balance in the atmosphere,” said Williams. “The consequence is that it is impossible to change the temperature patterns without having an effect on the wind patterns.” The increase in vertical shear has important consequences for aircraft. “If that wind shear effect gets too strong and moving from one layer [of air] up to the next there is a big jump in speed, that is what causes turbulence,” said Williams.  In other words, large changes in wind speeds with height can result in a breakdown, or disruption of layers of air. The impact goes beyond passengers having to keep their seatbelts on and forgo a plastic cup of wine. More patches of turbulence are likely to mean more diversions as planes try to avoid them, which will increase journey times, emissions and fuel costs. Previous work by the team suggests that, assuming drastic action on the climate crisis is not taken, the amount of severe turbulence in the atmosphere could double or triple by the period 2050-2080. The aviation industry could well be contributing to the changes Williams and his colleagues found. ,It currently accounts for about 2% of global CO2 emissions and is one of the fastest-growing polluters. This year is forecast to be another record-breaking year for air travel, with passengers expected to fly a total of 5tn miles (8.1tn km). Recent analysis by the Guardian highlights the disproportionate carbon footprint of those who can afford to fly. Taking a long-haul flight generates more CO2 emissions than the average person in many countries produces in a whole year. Even a short-haul flight from London to Edinburgh generates more CO2 emissions than a person in Uganda or Somalia produces in year. The study backs up predictions the team made several years ago that changes to vertical shear will not only be felt by those who fly. Researchers says it could also have important consequences for large-scale atmospheric thermodynamics and dynamics. “[With] climate change, normally we are thinking of ground level because that is where we live, but of course the climate is changing right up there at 35,000ft as well,” said Williams.  “The 15% shear increase must rank as one of the largest anthropogenic changes to have occurred in the climate system since satellite observations began. “The change has been taking place silently, high above our heads, for the past 40 years, and it has gone unnoticed until now. It makes me wonder what else we don’t yet know about how climate change is altering the global atmospheric circulation.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAmericans’ beliefs about climate change were recently surveyed by the Pew Research Center, and the results were made public a few days ago.  Pew pollsters found that a combined 51% of Americans agree that (a) there is no clear evidence the Earth is warming, or (b) natural factors are the main cause of climate changes.  Therefore, just 48% of Americans believe the Earth is getting warmer, and this warming is mostly caused by humans.  This belief percentage has essentially remained unchanged for the last 10 years, or since the survey was first conducted in 2006.

One key question in the survey pertained to Americans’ perception of the scientific “consensus”.   The Pew Research Center found that just 27% of Americans believe that “almost all” climate scientists maintain the belief that changes in climate are mostly caused by humans.
Of course, the presupposition underpinning this opinion question is the claim that upwards of 97% climate scientists — translated into “almost all” for the Pew survey — believe that climate changes since the mid-20th century have been mostly (i.e., more than 50%) caused by humans.   This oft-cited 97% figure was derived from a subjective abstract-counting exercise conducted by “Skeptical Science” blogger John Cook and colleagues (Cook et al., 2013, “Quantifying the Consensus…”).  Selected abstracts from 11,944 scientific papers published between 1991 and 2011 were used for the sample size, and of those papers just 65 (0.5% of the 11,944) were classified by Cook and his fellow raters as endorsing the specified Category 1 position that “Explicitly states that humans are the primary cause of recent global warming” (Legates et al., 2013).  This wouldn’t do, of course.  So, to ultimately reach the 97% endorsement percentage the Cook team had set out to obtain in the first place, they intentionally combined the (65) Category 1 quantified “consensus” statement papers  with the (934) Category 2 and (2,933) Category 3 endorsement papers that only needed to state (2) or just imply (3) that humans are a cause of climate changes.  These Category 2 and 3 papers did not quantify the contribution or indicate humans are a primary (>50%) cause of climate change, but they were nonetheless combined with Category 1 papers anyway.
Of course, nearly all scientists would agree that a human contribution greater than 0% exists, or that humans can be a cause — however modest  — of some degree of climate change.  So by combining the very high endorsement rates from Categories 2 and 3 (that even most skeptics acknowledge, as they agree humans contribute to climate change to some degree) with the negligibly small endorsement rates for Category 1 (just 65 papers), and by excluding many hundreds of papers from consideration that were published by scientists questioning the theory, Cook et al. (2013) were ultimately able to get away with proclaiming that 97% of scientists believe that climate changes since 1950 have mostly been caused by humans.
But as the evidence from the Pew survey  indicates, despite their best efforts, John Cook and cohorts have not been able to convince the general public that subjective abstract-counting exercises are a sound or scientific means to gauge “consensus.”  As mentioned, only 27% of Americans believe that “almost all” (i.e., 97%) climate scientists maintain the belief that humans are the primary cause of changes in the climate system.  Not only that, just 28% Americans agree that climate scientists even understand (“very well”) what factors cause climate changes.

And Americans may be right.  According to analysis found in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (Prokopy et al., 2015, Lefsrud and Meyer, 2012, Stenhouse et al., 2016), surveys of professional climatologists, engineers, geologists, and agronomists indicate that the percentage of these scientists who believe that changes in the climate system are primarily caused by humans falls abysmally short of the claimed 97%.  In fact, these studies reveal that only 53% of climatologists and meteorologists, 36% of professional engineers and geoscientists, and 19% of agronomists believe that changes in the climate system are mostly human-caused.
53% Of Climatologists Believe, 19% Of Agronomists Believe
In a survey of Midwest-based climatologists and agronomists (here called “extension educators” who have “at least a Masters degree” in agronomic sciences), just 53% of climatologists and 19.2% of agronomists believe that changes in the climate system are primarily caused by humans.
Prokopy et al., 2015
“In 2012, a total of 22 state and extension climatologists were selected through a purposive sample to represent main outlets of publicly available and location-specific climate information in the region. … About 53% attributed climate change primarily to human activities.”

“Extension educators are a unique set of agricultural advisors who serve to connect and translate research from universities to farmers in order to decrease risk to the farm enterprise and increase productive capacity and resilience. Typically, Extension educators have at least a Masters degree and are trained in agronomic sciences, which may not include climate sciences. … [O]ver 19% attribut[e] climate change primarily to human activities.”

36% Of Engineers, Geoscientists Believe
Among professional engineers and geoscientists trained in the physical sciences, only 36% are believers in the “consensus” position that humans are the “main or central” cause of changes in the climate system.
Lefsrud and Meyer, 2012
“The largest group of APEGA respondents (36%) … express the strong belief that climate change is happening, that it is not a normal cycle of nature, and humans are the main or central cause.”

53% Of Professional Meteorologists Believe
Stenhouse et al., 2016
Conflict about Climate Change at the American Meteorological Society: Meteorologists’ Views on a Scientific and Organizational Controversy
“A web-based survey was sent to all professional (i.e. non-student) members of the AMS in December 2011. …  Members who said the global warming of the last 150 years was mostly caused by human activity (53% of full sample).  … Members who are convinced of largely human-caused climate change expressed that debate over global warming sends an unclear message to the public.  Conversely, members who are unconvinced of human-caused climate change often felt that their peers were closed-minded, and were suppressing unpopular views.”
Ninety-Seven Percent Bunk
To summarize, the American public is about as likely to believe that climate changes are mostly caused by humans as are meteorologists and climatologists (48% vs. 53%, respectively).  And Americans in general are much more likely to believe that humans are the primary cause of climate changes as professionals trained in the physical sciences: 48% of U.S. citizens are believers, whereas ~20-35% of professionals with physical science degrees (engineers, Earth scientists, agronomists) are believers.
To put it non-delicately, the claim that “almost all” scientists (i.e., 97%) believe that most changes in the climate system are caused by humans is … bunk.
And most Americans already knew that.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Swiss online Basler Zeitung (BaZ) writes that critics of Donald Trump are wrong with their apocalyptic hype and exaggerations surrounding the President’s rejection of the Paris climate accord.
Worthless Accord
The BaZ writes that Trump is right because the Paris Accord is “a document that has gone off track in every way” and that it is an accord “soaking with hatred of the West” and makes “grotesque, empty promises” to developing countries.
The BaZ commentary calls the Paris Accord as a whole a “paper without value” because it contains no legally binding obligations and only includes toothless “intended nationally determined contributions” (INDCs), which means each country can determine on its own how much CO2 it intends to cut back on, without any enforcement mechanisms.
“A farce”
The BaZ commentary slams the Paris Accord for allowing China and India to continue emitting as usual until 2030, and then only gradually cutting back thereafter. It goes on to say that the commitments pledged by some of the industrial countries would be “fully unrealistic to achieve” and that it makes the accord “a farce”.
It won’t have in any way, as scientists at MIT […] have already calculated, any effects. Even if all 195 countries fulfilled what they said they would and achieved all their INDCs, the temperature would rise perhaps 1.9 to 2.6°C by 2050 and maybe 3.1 to 5.2°C by 2100. […] In fact the accord sought to limit the rise to ‘significantly’ less than 2°C. […] According to the MIT – and depending on the numbers used – the planet would warm up a whole 0.2°C less if the Paris Accord was adhered to.”

“Disrupts a circle of elitists”
The BaZ opinion then reminds readers how the science is filled with uncertainty and involves complex computer simulations, and what is really going on is that Donald Trump is massively disrupting a “circle of elitists”. The BaZ comments further:
Things were so wonderful at the conferences and global summits – until that elephant smashed everything that was in his way. China in the china cabinet? No, he simply stamped out all the hot air. (Basler Zeitung)”

"Puerto Rico’s ongoing struggles to recover from the devastation of Hurricane Maria could be routinely replicated in other places if the climate crisis spurs nationalistic governments to scale back aid to certain disaster victims. That’s a warning from bestselling author David Wallace-Wells, whose book The Uninhabitable Earth was described in a Guardian review as a “brutal portrait of climate change”.  The indifference of US politicians to the Hurricane Maria disaster is chilling, he warns. Maria smashed into Puerto Rico in September 2017, killing about 3,000 people, crippling the power grid and devastating the island’s agriculture and tourism industries. The US government’s sluggish response to the disaster was found to be deficient in an official report, with many Puerto Ricans claiming the federal government has been indifferent to their plight. The island has since been racked with dysfunction and political turmoil, leading to the recent departure of the governor, Ricardo Rosselló. As global heating fuels more powerful hurricanes, as well as rising sea levels, drought and wildfires, more people around the world will be in need of assistance at a time when populist, nationalist leaders have gained prominence in several countries including the US, where Donald Trump gained infamy in Puerto Rico for visiting the island and throwing paper towels at hurricane survivors. “What really stands out to me about Maria is the indifference of much American power to suffering even to those within its borders, seeing those people as somehow less American and less deserving,” said Wallace-Wells. “In the US we often find ways to turn away from people suffering in places like Mozambique or Bangladesh. The harrowing thing about Puerto Rico is that even American citizens were defined as undeserving. It’s horrifying and ugly on its own terms on a moral level but also as a glimmer of the way we will respond to these disasters down the road. “We are already seeing more intense competition for resources and focusing our investments and political sympathies closer and closer to home. It’s concerning because all suffering in the world now has some sort of climate fingerprint.” Wallace-Wells is one of the leading figures to have attended the second annual International Congress of Youth Voices, held this year in Puerto Rico’s capital San Juan. The summit, founded by the author Dave Eggers and the not-for-profit leader Amanda Uhle, has attracted around 150 international students, mostly aged between 16 and 20 years old, to meet with various writers, politicians and activists. Last year’s congress, held in San Francisco, drew young people from places including the US, Sweden, Iraq, Australia, Zambia and Nepal. The climate crisis is one of the leading issues discussed at the congress, amid a broader movement of young activists around the world who have taken to striking from school or shutting down areas of cities to demand that elected leaders do more to curb global heating. A figurehead for this insurrection is Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who sparked the school strike movement. Thunberg has been feted by several national leaders and will attend the upcoming UN climate summit in New York City. Given her aversion to flying due to the associated carbon pollution, Thunberg will reach New York via solar powered boat. Wallace-Wells said the youth climate movement was “inspiring and exhilarating and also a little surprising”. “A year ago I’d say I would be sceptical that there would be a mass protest movement on climate,” he said. “Now in the immediate aftermath of the IPCC report in October we are seeing much more commitment, concentrated among young people, and I think that’s fantastic. That young people have such clear, unarguable moral standing really does change the landscape of climate politics.” In the US, young climate activists have faced a political class that is still unclear over its response to the escalating crisis. In February, veteran Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein was videoed rebuffing pleas from young people to implement the Green New Deal, a platform to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions supported by progressive Democrats. “I think that encounter would be very different it it happened today, quite a lot has changed even in that time,” Wallace-Wells said. “More people are focused on these issues, even those on the right are making rhetorical gestures. “I think we’ve already passed a tipping point. When I look at the broader cultural and media response to the youth protests, it’s been very powerful. Most people have been moved and inspired and, in a useful way, shamed.” • This article was amended on 12 August 2019 to correct the name of David Wallace-Wells’ book."

Undercuts ‘Consensus’ Science


During the first 6 months of 2017, 285 scientific papers have already been published that cast doubt on the position that anthropogenic CO2 emissions function as the climate’s fundamental control knob…or that otherwise question the efficacy of climate models or the related “consensus” positions commonly endorsed by policymakers and mainstream media.
These 285 new papers support the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate and climate changes.  Climate science is not settled.
Modern temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events are neither unusual nor unprecedented.  Many regions of the Earth are cooler now than they have been for most of the last 10,000 years.
Natural factors such as the Sun (84 papers), multi-decadal oceanic-atmospheric oscillations such as the NAO, AMO/PDO, ENSO (31 papers), decadal-scale cloud cover variations, and internal variability in general have exerted a significant influence on weather and climate changes during both the past and present.  Detecting a clear anthropogenic forcing signal amidst the noise of unforced natural variability may therefore be difficult.
And current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often costly, ineffective, and perhaps even harmful to the environment.  On the other hand, elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields).
It should be noted that the rate of inclusion on this year’s “Skeptic Papers” list at the halfway point is slightly ahead of last year’s pace.  That’s because in 2016 there were 500 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in scholarly journals (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3) challenging “consensus” climate science.

"Pacific leaders have called on Australia to abandon plans to use carry-over credits to meet Paris climate targets and to immediately stop new coalmining, warning some of their countries could be uninhabitable as soon as 2030. In a strongly worded statement issued at the end of a Pacific Islands development forum in Fiji, the leaders said they were deeply concerned about a lack of “comprehension, ambition or commitment” from developed nations despite the climate crisis posing grave consequences for their people.  They called for greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced immediately, pointing to the “stark warnings” in a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change setting out what would need to be done to limit global heating to 1.5C. “The science warns of the real possibility that coral atoll nations could become uninhabitable as early as 2030,” the statement, called the Nadi Bay declaration, said. “By 2100, the coral atoll nations of the republic of the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tokelau and the Maldives and many [small island developing states] could be submerged.” Last week Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, rejected calls from Pacific states for Australia to do more to combat climate change, telling the ABC they “should be pleased” that it was meeting the target it set at the 2015 Paris meeting. Most climate experts say Australia is not expected to meet its 2030 emissions target – a 26%-28% cut below 2005 levels – under current policies and the country would need to make much deeper cuts than proposed to play its part under the Paris agreement. Australia’s emissions have risen year on year since the Coalition repealed a national carbon price scheme. In a clear reference to Australia, the statement called on the countries to refrain from using carry-over credits from the Kyoto protocol to meet targets under the Paris agreement. Other developed countries have said they will not use carry-over credits, which Australia has access to after over-achieving compared with its Kyoto agreement target of a 5% cut below 2000 levels. Analysts say using these credits effectively reduces Australia’s Paris commitment by about eight percentage points. Climate campaigners say the credits do nothing to escalate efforts to combat the problem as is required and Australia has access to carry-over credits only because it set itself unambitious Kyoto targets. The statement signed by nine leaders also called on coal producers “to immediately cease any new mining of coal and develop a strategy for a decadal phase-out and closure of all existing coal production”. It wanted developed countries to take immediate steps to stop subsidies to fossil fuels and to support climate finance and technology transfer for vulnerable nations. It said the climate emergency “poses the single greatest threat to the human rights and security of present and future generations of Pacific Island peoples”. The development forum came two weeks before the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, attends the separate Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu. Australia is yet to respond to a request from the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, asking countries to outline plans to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 ahead of a climate action summit in New York in September. Frank Bainimarama, Fiji’s prime minister and chair of the development forum, called on all developed countries – but especially what he called “our larger neighbours in the Pacific” – to hear the call ahead of the Tuvalu meeting and make their Paris commitments more ambitious. “We cannot allow climate commitments to be watered down in the meeting hosted by the nation whose very existence is threatened by the rising waters lapping at its shores,” he said. Richie Merzian, from the progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said the call by Pacific leaders for carry-over credits to be cancelled was unprecedented. “The Nadi Bay declaration is an unadulterated and powerful message to Australia and other major economies that, ahead of the UN climate summit in September, they need to lift their game on climate action,” he said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his Environmental Progress site here, Michael Shellenberger writes that Stanford University Professor Mark Z. Jacobson is suing a “prestigious team of scientists for Debunking 100% renewables.
This reminds us of the 17 or so attorneys general who sought to use the US Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) in order to go after and silence climate science skeptics, accusing them of perpetuating fraud by daring to question the flakey science underpinning the manmade global warming theory.
Shellenberger wrote that professor Mark Z. Jacobson had “filed a lawsuit, demanding $10 million in damages, against the peer-reviewed scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) and a group of eminent scientists (Clack et al.) for their study showing that Jacobson made improper assumptions in order to claim that he had demonstrated U.S. energy could be provided exclusively by renewable energy, primarily wind, water, and solar.”

“Speechless”…climate-energy debate needs to get “a direction of sanity”
Climatologist Prof. Judith Curry at her Climate Etc site wrote that she was “speechless”, adding:
In many ways, this is much worse than any of Michael Mann’s lawsuits alleging defamation of character [link] — Jacobson’s lawsuit seeks to settle a genuine scientific disagreement in the courts.”

However, Prof. Curry does not see “a good ending” for Jacobson: “There will undoubtedly be a countersuit and he stands to lose a lot of money (not just his lawsuit)”.
Many observers feel this is just the latest attempt to shut down free speech within the realm of science — a highly worrisome development that reminds us of brutal totalitarian regimes.
Curry notes: “Possibly, there will be sufficient backlash against this that will steer the overall climate-energy debate back towards a direction of sanity.”
This can only be hoped for.
Blogger Shellenberger calls the move by Jacobson “unprecedented”, adding:
Scientific disagreements must be decided not in court but rather through the scientific process. We urge Stanford University, Stanford Alumni, and everyone who loves science and free speech to denounce this lawsuit.”
This of course would be expected from almost any higher education institution in any other free-speech-abiding, democratic state. But with flakey, culturally neurotic California, nothing can be ruled out.

"Gaby Hinsliff (Journal, 3 August) is right to insist that the ultimate decision on numbers of children is in the hands of women and their partners but ignores the many ways that any modern state already makes so many of the rules regarding sex and reproduction. Just think of all the rights and allowances that determine the length of maternity leave, resuming work, flexible working, equal pay and the like. Then, there are decisions by states to subsidise or not the costs of childcare, including all the costs of education from pre-school to university and college. Throughout, there are rules and regulations about which maternity and childcare services are state- or authority-provided. Couples reproduce in such economic and regulatory environments and it would be naive to think that such powerful social and economic decisions do not bear on the timing and numbers of births they choose. A declining population is not in anyone’s interest, reducing the pool of new talent in the next generation and encouraging an imbalance between those concerned with the cost of TV licences and others eager to see young innovators moving through our age cohorts.  Sure, there are major populations in sub-Saharan Africa with total fertility rates too high for their current economic growth, but changing their fiscal and social environments in favour of a life less constrained by childbearing for such women is not beyond our capacity to imagine without the fear of being charged with “population control”.Allan G HillProfessor of population and international health, University of Southampton • Simon Cooke of Marie Stopes International is right to draw attention to the link between the climate crisis and population growth (Letters, 7 August). The Guardian has reported (Best solution to climate change? Fewer children, 12 July 2017) that having one fewer child saves 58.6 tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year. This is by far the biggest saving that can be achieved by an individual in altering their own lifestyle.Roger PlentyStroud, Gloucestershire • The second letter above was amended on 11 August 2019. An earlier version omitted the word “tonnes”."
"Over the past couple of weeks things have been happening on the climate change front but, unfortunately, little is changing in parliament, where the government’s direct action policy has continued to be an utter failure and a Queensland LNP MP suggested in his first speech in the House of Representatives that schools should teach both sides of the climate change debate in school – to prevent them being “brainwashed with extreme left or right ideologies”.  Last week came news that BHP was going to spend US$400m over five years on a “climate investment program to develop technologies to reduce emissions from its own operations as well as those generated from the use of its resources”. Its CEO, Andrew Mackenzie, stated in a speech in London, “Society’s combustion of fossil fuels and industrial processes like steelmaking and agriculture have released greenhouse gases at rates much faster than at any other time in the geological past.” To ram the message home he concluded: “The evidence is abundant: global warming is indisputable. The planet will survive. Many species may not.” Just ponder that: many species will not survive. Thus it was not particularly surprising really to hear this week that the NSW HSC was going to include climate change in geography classes. The surprising element was that it doesn’t already. Neither was it surprising to see conservatives across the media come out against it, arguing that if they are to teach climate change then they need to teach “both sides”. The IPA’s “director of the foundations of western civilisation program” Bella d’Abrera (yeah, I know) suggested on Sky News that “they’re going to hear hopefully that climate change is not necessary manmade”. Or in other words, students should hear that conspiracy theories are real. This is the type of guff that you expect to hear from the libertarian romper room that Sky News is now. It’s a station that gives a voice to the likes of Andrew Bolt, who this week devoted a column to calling 16-year-old climate-change activist Greta Thunberg “deeply disturbed” and mocking her autism diagnosis. She responded by flicking him away with ease – which to be honest was not wholly difficult given I’ve had cases of tinea that have contributed more to our national intelligence than has Bolt’s entire media career. But she did it with class. In parliament you would hope for better than the dredge we get on Sky News. But no. On Wednesday, newly elected Queensland MP Terry Young gave his first speech, in which he stated “we want our children and grandchildren to hear the theories of evolution and creation, different religions, climate change advocates and climate change sceptics. I can say what we don’t want for us and our kids is to be brainwashed with extreme left or right ideologies.” “Theories of creation”? Religion is a theory now? He continued arguing, “When I hear a school principal stand up at school assembly and say ‘if this government doesn’t do anything about climate change, the world will end in 2030’ I get angry, because we should not indoctrinate our kids with fear mongering.” Now, firstly, I’d like to know where that happened because I can find no record of it. It sort of happened in the TV show Big Little Lies, so maybe that was it. But here’s the thing, he should get angry if he hears that – not because it is brainwashing but because his government is not doing anything about climate change. The world is not going to end in 2030, but if we have not taken massive steps by then, our ability to prevent massive global degradation and harm due to climate change will be beyond us. This is not extremist, it is science – science that was announced in October by the UN IPCC. Its co-chair said at the time: “This is the largest clarion bell from the science community and I hope it mobilises people and dents the mood of complacency.” But no, it didn’t. Young went on to suggest personal responsibility was more important and the fact his family own a hybrid car and have solar panels was a sign of how conservatives go about things the right way. It is much the same line we have heard by so many conservatives – a variant of if we all plant a tree and recycle then that’s all we can do. It won’t be anywhere near enough, and it might seem like “common sense” to Young but it is not. Just how lacking the LNP’s climate change policy is in anything approaching substance was revealed this week when its latest auction under the “emissions reduction fund” bought cuts equivalent to only 0.01% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas pollution. The government is utterly failing to achieve even its own pathetically low emissions reduction targets. And time is running out fast. This week in the Monthly, ANU climate scientist Dr Joëlle Gergis wrote that, while in 2013 scientists had estimated that a doubling of CO2 levels from pre-industrial levels (which we’re on track to do by 2060) would lead to a temperature increase of between 1.5C to 4.5C, now as scientists continue to get more data, their models suggest the temperature increase is more likely to be between 2.8C and 5.8C. That’s scary because all efforts at the moment are assuming if we reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 we can limit warming to 1.5C. That might now be rather too optimistic. Add into the mix came further news this week that glaciers appear to be melting 10 to 100 times faster than expected. It’s time to stop being mealy-mouthed about this and to give silent passes to those peddling climate-change denialism either explicitly or implicitly by demanding we listen to both sides. But OK, here’s both sides of the debate – for well over 40 years scientists have been researching and testing evidence that climate change is occurring due to CO2 emissions. They have found conclusive evidence that there is a link and that on the current path by 2100 global temperatures will likely reach 3C above pre-industrial levels. The other side is that they have kept researching and testing the data, and sorry, they were wrong – it’s even worse than they thought. • Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia"
"Greta Thunberg started her long journey to climate summits in the Americas by joining a treetop protest in Germany’s Hambach forest, where environmentalists have been fighting for years to stop the ancient woodland being torn up for open-cast coal mining. The battle to save the last remaining oak and hornbeam trees reflects the young activist’s entwined fights to protect the natural world from human exploitation and to halt carbon emissions. “The Hambach Forest is so important because it’s so symbolic,” Thunberg told the Observer, standing under treehouses where activists live year-round to stop the trees being felled. “[The mining here] is such a huge contribution to the ecological crisis and the climate crisis.” Earlier the 16-year-old Swede – who is about to set sail for the US and Chile to attend UN climate summits – had visited the mine, an open wasteland that stretches for kilometres, taking in both former forest and former farmland. She met people from the surrounding area whose villages are also due to be razed to make way for the mine. “I have visited coal mines before, but this was so huge and so devastating to see,” she said. “It makes me incredibly sad, to see all this destruction, in this area that used to be a forest ecosystem, and I feel sorry for the people who have to move.” The area, near Cologne in western Germany, is home to endangered species, including Bechstein’s bats, but its trees and fern-filled clearings also represent a rare remaining sliver of a woodland ecosystem that once filled this part of the Rhine river plain. Since mining began in 1978 the Hambach – or Hambi as activists affectionately call it – has shrunk to only 10% of the original 13,500 acres. The rest was cleared to allow the utility firm RWE to extract the “brown coal” or lignite lying beneath, at a rate of about 40m tonnes a year. The trees are felled and the forest floor torn up to reach coal deposits, leaving long gashes of open earth, that mark out the mine on satellite photographs with streaks of black and ochre. The lignite, along with supplies taken from other mines in the area, is burned in nearby power stations. Three, the Niederaußem, Neurath and Weisweiler plants, are all individually among the 10 biggest carbon dioxide emitters in Europe. Together they make the region’s coal the continent’s biggest source of the greenhouse gas, the activists say. For more than seven years a committed group have been living in some of the oldest, tallest trees, serving as human shields against RWE. When Thunberg won Germany’s Golden Camera award in March, she dedicated it to the Hambach activists, who invited her to come and see their struggle for herself, and she started her trip to the Americas by taking up that offer. After visiting the mine she joined activists in one of the highest protest sites, lifted 15 metres off the ground in a climbing harness to a wooden house in the high branches of a centuries-old oak tree. Jana Boltersdorf, a 17-year-old protester who has been coming to the forest for years, said Thunberg’s visit was a “surreal” inspiration. “She has become a great symbol for climate justice, and this forest also has become a great symbol for climate justice,” Boltersdorf said. “Now those two great symbols which are very important to my life are coming together. It doesn’t feel real.” Several times the treehouses have all been cleared and their occupants arrested, and several times the activists have returned to their perches. But in 2018, the regular showdown captured national attention, said Luisa Neubauer, one of the leaders of the Fridays for Future youth movement in Germany. And when it reached the national stage, the battle for Hambach brought the climate crisis into focus for many Germans, she believes, by connecting intangible carbon emissions to something both tangible and much loved. “Wild forest in Germany is a very important part of our culture, of our understanding of what this country is,” Neubauer, said. “It’s impossible [for many people] to imagine protecting the climate, but it is possible to imagine protecting the forest.” Its destruction seems shortsighted as Germany pivots away from coal, which still provides about a third of the country’s electricity. With a target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels, by next year, Berlin needs to act urgently. A government-appointed commission said last month that Germany should shut down all of its coal-fired power plants by 2038, and recommended setting aside €40bn (£37bn) in aid to help areas affected by the shutdowns, where the mining and power industries are major employers. That new deadline has brought both frustration and hope for the forest protesters and people in villages around the area, whose homes had been slated for destruction. David Dresen, 28, has given up his job as a maths teacher to campaign for Kuckum, the village where his family have lived in the same farmhouse since the 1700s. Along with six others in the area it is due to be destroyed in 2027, but what once seemed like an almost hopeless fight now feels less bleak. “We have been fighting lignite since the 1980s and for a long time no one heard what we said,” he said after meeting Thunberg. “If this movement is able to save the forest, why should it not be possible to save our villages?” What remains of the forest has been given a stay of execution, but this is only temporary. With the confrontations between protesters and police gaining widespread publicity, and a case brought by environmentalists making its way through the courts, RWE has agreed a moratorium until 2020. Thunberg will be attending climate summits in New York in September and Santiago in December. She does not fly because of the carbon footprint this leaves, and so will travel overland to the UK, cross the Atlantic on a racing yacht, and finally travel by train and bus to Chile. “I have not sailed before, so I’m going now to get some basic lessons on what to do and what not to do,” she said. “But the people I’m going with are professionals so I’m not worried about safety.”"

=  Man-Made Climate Change

In late 2015, Soon, Connolly, and Connolly (hereafter SCC15) published a  comprehensive (101 pages) analysis of how the modern anthropogenic global warming (AGW) paradigm has been constructed.  The paper, published in  Earth Science Reviews, is entitled Re-evaluating the role of solar variability on Northern Hemisphere temperature trends since the 19th century.
What follows is a very brief summary of some of the graphical highlights in SCC15 as well as the fully cited conclusion.  Succinctly, the paper can be divided into 2 parts.
1. The instrumental temperature record has undergone heavy adjustments (a utilization of an urban temperature station siting bias) to allow a better fit with climate models that  presume CO2 emissions drive temperature.
2..  CO2-based climate models do not adequately correlate with Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature trends of the last 130 years; solar activity changes do correlate well with NH trends — especially when urban bias has been removed from the temperature record.

Urban Bias Artificially Adds ~0.09 °C Per Decade To Land Temperatures



SCC15:
“[A]lthough there are 126 fully rural stations with data during the 1951-1990 period, there are only 13 and 17 fully rural stations during the 1907-1950 and 1991-2014 periods respectively, and none of the stations with records before 1907 are still fully rural. … For individual urban stations and areas in China, the temperature records can be very strongly affected by urbanization bias. For instance, Ren et al. (2007) found that between 65-80% of the apparent warming trend over the 1961-2000 period for the Beijing and Wuhan station records was probably due to increasing urban heat islands.  [T]he temperature trends increase from +0.025°C/decade (fully rural) to … +0.119°C/decade (fully urban). … If we assume that the fully rural stations are unaffected by urbanization bias, while the other subsets are, then we can estimate the extent of urbanization bias in the “all stations” trends by subtracting the fully rural trends. This gives us an estimate of +0.094°C/decade urbanization bias over the 1951-1990 period – similar to Wang & Ge (2012)’s +0.09°C/decade estimate.”



Rural Temperature Stations That Show Minimal Warming Are Removed



There are now fewer U.S. rural stations contributing to the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) than there were in 1900.



According to McKitrick (2010), 75% of temperature stations across the globe have been removed since the 1970s, mostly from rural or non-urban areas.  Temperature stations located in urban areas — where paved roads and industrialized waste heat artificially warm the surface – have been allowed to remain.

McKitrick, 2010

Pre-1950s Warmth Removed, Post-1950s Warmth Added…To Make The Data Fit The Models



Solar Variability Correlates Well With The 1880s-Present NH Temperature Record 




Conclusion/Summary From Soon, Connolly, &  Connolly, 2015

1.  “We have constructed a new estimate of Northern Hemisphere surface air temperature trends derived from mostly rural stations – thereby minimizing the problems introduced to previous estimates by urbanization bias. Similar to previous estimates, our composite implies warming trends during the periods 1880s-1940s and 1980s-2000s. However, this new estimate implies a more pronounced cooling trend during the 1950s-1970s. As a result, the relative warmth of the mid-20th century warm period is comparable to the recent warm period – a different conclusion to previous estimates. Although our new composite implies different trends from previous estimates, we note that it is compatible with Northern Hemisphere temperature trends derived from (a) sea surface temperatures; (b) glacier length records; (c) tree ring widths.”
2.   “However, the recent multi model means of the CMIP5 Global Climate Model hindcasts failed to adequately reproduce the temperature trends implied by our composite, even when they included both “anthropogenic and natural forcings”. One reason why the hindcasts might have failed to accurately reproduce the temperature trends is that the solar forcings they used all implied relatively little solar variability. However, in this paper, we carried out a detailed review of the debate over solar variability, and revealed that considerable uncertainty remains over exactly how the Total Solar Irradiance has varied since the 19th century. When we compared our new composite to one of the high solar variability reconstructions of Total Solar Irradiance which was not considered by the CMIP5 hindcasts (i.e., the Hoyt & Schatten reconstruction), we found a remarkably close fit. If the Hoyt & Schatten reconstruction and our new Northern Hemisphere temperature trend estimates are accurate, then it seems that most of the temperature trends since at least 1881 can be explained in terms of solar variability, with atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations providing at most a minor contribution. This contradicts the claim by the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports that most of the temperature trends since the 1950s are due to changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Bindoff et al., 2013).”

"A heatwave pulsating through the Arctic helped push Alaska to its warmest month ever recorded in July, with the state’s vast coastline left completely barren of sea ice. Alaska’s average temperature in July was a record 58.1F (14.5C), nearly 1F above the previous monthly high set in July 2004, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Cities and towns across the vast US state, such as Anchorage, Utqiaġvik (formerly known as Barrow) and Kodiak all had their warmest month in 125 years of record-keeping.  #Alaska’s avg temperature for #July 2019 (58.1°F) was 5.4 degrees above avg and 0.8 degree more than record set in July 2004: @NOAANCEIclimate https://t.co/3pfWB8hVKT #StateOfClimate pic.twitter.com/qBdWFYywYY This heat, 5.4F warmer than the long-term average for July, helped spur wildfires that shrouded much of Alaska in a pall of smoke and has now resulted in a remarkable melting away of shoreline ice. There is now no sea ice within 150 miles of Alaskan shores, according to an analysis by the National Weather Service. The pace of ice loss is “unprecedented” in 40 years of satellite records, scientists said, with the Bering Sea, which separates Alaska from Russia, left completely ice-free. The record-breaking warmth in Alaska is part of a broader heatwave that has swept the northern latitudes, with Greenland shedding a record 12.5 gigatons of ice into the ocean in a single day, Norway experiencing its joint hottest day ever and forest fires in Siberia tearing through an area as large as Belgium. Scientists warned that the extreme conditions are consistent with the most pessimistic scenario where countries do little to constrain global heating by cutting planet-warming gases from cars, trucks and power generation. “We are seeing record after record after record,” said Marco Tedesco, a climate scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, of the heat and melting episodes. “It looks like the worst case scenario put forward by the IPCC [International Panel on Climate Change] could be an underestimate because we are seeing ice melting now that we expected 30 to 40 years from now. It’s alarming because it’s very fast-paced and the consequences are hard to predict.” Arctic sea ice accumulates over winter before receding as temperatures start to rise in spring. The unusually hasty retreat of ice in 2019 has been prompted by persistent southerly winds, storms and high temperatures roiling both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Across the Arctic, July set a new record low for sea ice extent, at 2.93m sq miles. “While we cannot directly compare one particular extreme year to climate change, the long-term trends are obvious – sea ice is declining and temperatures are rising,” said Zack Labe, a climate scientist at the University of California, Irvine. He added: “Without a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, climate change will continue to increase the probability of extreme heatwaves around the world.” The Arctic is heating up at about twice the average of the rest of the world, with the frigid polar region caught in a spiral where sea ice thins and melts away, opening up vast tracts of dark ocean that is more absorbent of heat, causing further warming. The loss of ice causes numerous hazards for communities living in the Arctic, with many facing complete relocation. Meanwhile, the melting of glaciers in Greenland are a leading contributor to sea level rise that imperils coastal cities around the world via flooding. Tedesco said that the pace of melting in Greenland this year is on track to break a record set in 2012, when a net 562 gigatons of ice was lost. This will probably raise the global sea level by more than 1mm. If Greenland’s entire ice sheet were to melt, the world’s oceans would rise by about 20ft. “What’s happening in Greenland is exceptional and shows that the melting is not only increasing but accelerating,” said Tedesco. “There are still cascading events we still don’t fully understand. We will see impacts on society and life as we know it.” The unspooling of the Arctic’s environment will be just one consequence of global heating discussed at an upcoming UN climate summit in New York in September. Governments will meet amid growing alarm over heatwaves, fierce storms, drought and food insecurity that have wracked countries around the world. Such concerns have sparked a global protest movement, headed by young activists such as the teenager Greta Thunberg, who is sailing to New York on a solar-powered boat for the UN summit. “My concern is that Greenland will be forgotten because there will probably be a huge hurricane by then,” said Tedesco. “Momentum is gaining but there is clearly a strong need to take real action on this at a government level.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterA tsunami of outrage swept across Germany right after President Donald Trump announced dropping out of the Paris Accord (and not to transfer billions of taxpayer money over to the UN each year).
It appears the President’s bold and courageous move is leading to potentially dangerous pockets of energy policy and climate science uprising in Germany.
A reader just pointed out something a bit stunning: Germany’s flagship ARD television, the country’s version of the BBC, reported here how a group of conservative politicians from Angela Merkel’s CDU party known as the Berliner Kreis has just voiced its strong opposition to the party’s climate and energy policy course.

A group from Angela Merkel’s CDU party recently released its “Climate and Energy Political Demands”, calling for a science and energy policy “without ideology”, an end to “moral extortion”, and an exit from the “climate saving circus”, pdf here.
According to the ARD report, the group of conservatives is disputing the “‘solitary role’of the greenhouse effect in global warming’ – and is demanding a change in direction in the chancellor’s climate policy“.
The Berliner Kreis, led by Philipp Lengsfeld and Sylvia Pantel, issued an official declaration (German), see pdf here.
“World rescue circus”
The Berliner Kreis declaration demands a return to science “without ideology”, a “fact-based” discussion — one free of “moral extortion” –, and calls for a “reform of the IPCC”, which “has not been as scientifically sound as an advising body needs to be”.
The Berliner Kreis declaration adds that the science must not become “a sort of world rescue circus”.

The Christian conservative group also casts Germany’s CO2 reductions policy into question, noting that so far the country has cut back its CO2 emissions by less than half a billion tonnes while the rest of the plant has increased it by 14 billion tonnes, i.e. 30 times more than what the country has saved.
Germany’s CO2 emissions represent only 2% of the globe’s output, but its energy policy has been 100% pain.
Alinsky-type target?
Now that the Berliner Kreis position has become public, already it has come in the cross-hairs of major media outlets, setting off a wave of reports, e.g. here, here and here.
It remains to be seen what the real ARD intent of their report was: Whether to show that there is dissent in on the climate topic in Germany and that policy needs to take a step back, or if it is to identify and single out unwanted voices Alinsky style (Rule 13).
Lately the approach used by the media and entrenched establishment in Germany concerning unwanted dissenting voices on sensitive issues – such as Europe, immigration and climate – has followed the labelling formula of: dissent = extremism = Nazi. Many feel intimidated by it and thus are afraid to speak up.
What becomes of the dissident Berliner Kreis will remain a question. Expect Merkel to mobilize forces to shut them up, and down. The Berliner Kreis would be well-advised to quickly forge channels and networks with international dissenting groups, as they may be about to find out what the real price of civil courage is.
German publicist Dirk Maxeiner here, who knows first-hand the cost of civil courage, applauds the move by the group of CDU dissenters, commenting (with sarcasm):
A group of CDU parliamentarians that calls itself the ‘Berliner Kreis’ dares to think for itself on the climate issue. The Tagesschau comments on this atrocity with the headline: ‘CDU right wingers attack Merkel’s climate direction.’ Skepticism, thought, realism, facts – all right wing.”

What follows is a story that really reminds us why Britain opted out of the EU: British citizen (except for some Scots) don’t want every single bloody detail of their private lives regulated by a nanny super-state. They have had it!
EU bureaucrats think the Europeans are first-graders, and need proper upbringing.

Too brown! says the EU Kommisars. Photo credit: Popo le Chien – CC BY-SA 3.0. 
Recently reported by the online Die Welt here, the EU is now aiming to ban crispy, darker-colored french fries (darker-coloured chips for those living on the island). The reason: your safety!
“Crazy demands”
It’s just the latest damn excuse for more intrusive regulation. The EU’s regulation madness knows no limits. Just when you think it possibly couldn’t get more extreme, it does!
Our message back to EU bureaucrats: Us citizens do read, and we do know what is good for us and what isn’t. If we want our fries crispy brown from time to time, it’s for us to decide and not you clueless nanny bureaucrats in Brussels. Remember who pays you.
Past food guidelines made many of us sick
The fact of the matter is that decades-long we indeed did listen to you telling us what to eat: “high carb, low-fat”. That turned into a monumental health disaster and fiasco. And now you want to order us what to eat?
According to Die Welt:

Our fries may be golden yellow, and not darker. The EU has drawn up health-promoting rules for food processors, among them cooking instructions. The restaurant business is talking of ‘crazy demands’.”
The reason for the new laws, the EU claims, is that cooking fries and starchy products at high temperatures leads to acrylamide, a compound that studies have found increases the risk of cancer.
According to Die Welt, the EU countries have even approved the draft measure from the EU Commission. Speaking of the EU Commission, does anyone really know the name of s single person on it? Most people don’t, and it is so by design. No face, no target at which to aim criticism.
“EU regulation madness”
The law would apply to food manufacturers, restaurants and bakers. While consumer nanny groups view this as “an important step to health protection” the food and gastronomy industry are calling it “EU-regulation madness“, reports Die Welt.
If the EU wants to start doing something that really improves health, then they ought to start by taxing sugar and toxic sweeteners big time.
According to EU Health Kommissar Vytenis Andriukaitis (boy, that’s a name that’s easy to remember):
Today we have taken an important step in protecting the health and well-being of the citizens.“
No you haven’t. You have taken a step in confirming just how crazy you regulators have become.
The EU is also taking aim at the potato industry, where it intends to order potato farmer to grow “low starch potatoes” and regulate potato processors to remove starch from potatoes before frying them.
The law is planned to go into effect in Spring, 2019, Die Welt reports.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJapanese climate blogger Kirye caught my eye here at Twitter when posting a comparator chart of Arctic sea ice extent (and thickness) for 2007, 2015 and this year (2016) for September 4. In a nutshell, what is all the alarm about?
She comments that “Arctic ice is not doomed in the real world.” Clearly Arctic sea ice this summer will most likely not set a new record. There’s far more ice up there then what global warming alarmists hysterically projected earlier.
Also a recent chart of Arctic sea ice extent by the National Snow Ice and Data Center (NSIDC) shows that current sea ice extent is some half a million square kilometers over the 2012 level:

Source: NSIDC
Clearly over the past years Arctic sea ice has refused to have anything to do with the often claimed “death spiral” and alarmists are always forced to go back a number of years in order to get the sharp downward overall trend they want to see.
Lately, however, it has not been downward at all.

No downward trend over past decade
Looking back at the past 10 years, we see there has been practically no downward trend whatsoever. A chart generated at Woodfortrees here for the past 10 years clearly illustrates this:

No melt in 10 years! Chart: Woodfortrees
Clearly the Arctic is nowhere near a death spiral, and the polar ice has in fact defied the models and the many earlier predictions that it would disappear by 2015 altogether. With all that ice still up there, it’s time for the sea ice and global warming modelers to discard their equations – and to start over again from scratch.
With millions of square kilometers of ice still up there reflecting summer radiation back into space, it’s time readjust the energy budget.
Tipping points postponed again!

"George Monbiot is grossly unfair to describe as “pathetic” the new IPCC special report on climate change and land (Here’s the true cost of eating meat. It’s worse than you think, 9 August). There was no fear of the farming industry, nor any other pressure to suppress the science. Furthermore, the “not mentioned” Nature paper on carbon opportunity costs is cited twice in chapter 5 of the report, and the considerable climatic advantages of reducing meat and dairy are explicitly assessed. Nevertheless, the priority must be to halt emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation, to avoid immediate carbon release. The recovery of carbon stocks through environmental restoration and dietary change are also highly desirable, yet are slower processes, with the former jeopardised by continued temperature increase.Dr Phillip WilliamsonUniversity of East Anglia • I’m fed up with George Monbiot and many others continually spouting about the evils of meat and dairy and the virtues of a plant-based diet. We can’t all do it, George!  After a kidney transplant I must keep strictly to a low oxalate diet to avoid kidney stones forming in my new kidney. Oxalate is present to varying degrees in almost all plants – in fact in just about anything that grows, including soya and other meat substitutes. Meat and dairy contain none. Once George and the other plant evangelists have achieved their objective of destroying the meat and dairy industries and returning the land to nature and wildlife, can he suggest how I am to keep body and soul together? Yvonne Ingham Leicester • The much-trumpeted IPCC report (Impact of global heating on land poses threat to civilisation – UN, 9 August) is disappointing. The threat has been known for years, and in 2018 the IPCC said we had 12 years to limit catastrophe. Among the recommendations for “strong action from governments”, the report includes reforming farming subsidies and supporting small farmers, but it is weak on specifics. It points out that soil “is being lost more than 100 times faster than it is being formed in ploughed areas, and 10 to 20 times faster even on fields that are not tilled”. But there is no reference to conservation agriculture (CA), which nurtures the soil, encouraging water retention and CO2 absorption. What a wasted opportunity! CA is being increasingly practised around the world, with increased yields for both small and large farms; it has been called the most climate-friendly form of agriculture. But it is important to realise that CA is an ecosystem approach based on three interlinked principles: (i) continuous no or minimum mechanical soil disturbance; (ii) permanent maintenance of soil mulch cover; and (iii) diversification of cropping system. CA is present in all continents and all agricultural systems. Conservation tillage, reduced tillage and minimum tillage are not conservation agriculture, and nor is no-till on its own.J Peter GreavesBlackheath, London  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterMr. Kyoji Kimoto has asked me to post the following essay, which tells us leading climate sensitivity scientist Dr. Robert Cess admits the IPCC assumptions are erroneous. (Note: Because WordPress didn’t handle some of the scientific notation, I had to cut and paste parts of the text as images).
===================================
Dr. Robert D. Cess admits mathematical errors in the AGW theory of the IPCC
by Kyoji Kimoto
Soden & Held [1] shows climate sensitivity is 3°K for 2xCO2 from the 14 GCM studies for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (2007) as follows:
Climate sensitivity = no-feedback sensitivity (Planck response) x feedbacks
= 1.2°K x 2.5 = 3°K
Here, feedbacks are water vapor, ice albedo, lapse rate and cloud feedback.
In the AGW theory of the IPCC, the central assumption is that the Planck response is 1.2°K. Cess [2, 3] obtained the Planck feedback parameter lambda0 of -3.3(W/m2)/K utilizing eqn (1), giving the Planck response of 1.2K with the radiative forcing RF of 4W/m2 for 2xCO2 as follows:

Coincidently, the Planck response of 1.2°K by eqn (3) is in very good agreement with the Planck response of 1.2 – 1.3°K obtained with one dimensional radiative convective equilibrium model (1DRCM) studies in the literature [4, 5, 6]. Therefore, the Cess method has been followed by many researchers, including the IPCC 1st Assessment Report (1990) and the 14 GCM studies for the IPCC 4th Assessment Report (2007).
It is the sole theoretical basis of the central assumption of the IPCC that the Planck response is 1.2°K at present time [7, 8, 9], because the 1 DRCM study is fudged due to its strong dependence on lapse rate used according to Hansen’s idea expressed in an interview with Spencer Weart held on 23 October, 2000 at NASA.

On 23 August, 2016, Dr. Robert D. Cess gave me the following answer to my mail, admitting his mathematical errors in the derivation from eqn (1) to eqn (3). Dr. Cess was the leading climate scientist of Intercomparison Project of GCMs for the IPCC Assessment Reports. He wrote:
I will try this one more time, and then I will give up. A lot has happened since M&S (1964) and M&W (1967). In modern usage, the no-feedback sensitivity refers to holding all climate parameters fixed except surface temperature. It addresses the question: What would the sensitivity be if there were no interactive climate feedback mechanisms?.  Simply stated, it is a hypothetical reference sensitivity.  NO ONE HAS EVER CLAIMED THAT THE NO-FEEDBACK SENSITIVITY IS A TRUE INDICATION OF THE REAL SENSITIVITY.“
The AGW theory of the IPCC is constructed on the Planck response of 1.2°K produced by the mathematically erroneous Cess method. Since Cess has admitted his mathematical errors in the above reply, the theory totally collapses together with the high climate sensitivity of 3°K for a doubling of CO2. It raises sea surface temperature as much as 2°K, thus leading to the various AGW scares such as rapid sea level rise and severer extreme weather in the GCM studies of the IPCC.
Kimoto [11] showed the surface climate sensitivity of 0.14-0.17°K with the surface radiative forcing of 1.1 W/m2 for 2xCO2. It is reduced from the radiative forcing of 3.7 W/m2 at the tropopause due to infrared absorption overlap between CO2 and water vapor plentifully existing at the surface.
Policy based on false science
There is no need for the restriction of fossil fuel usage from the AGW scares claimed by the IPCC with its mathematically erroneous GCM studies. And ratification of Paris climate deal is harmful to mankind due to its useless CO2 regulations causing huge economic losses to the world.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWe often hear claims from the media of how president-elect Donald Trump unfairly got help from Vladimir Putin and the Russians to win the election, and that it’s outrageous a foreign government would meddle with and influence the US political process. (Never mind these allegations continue to be based on practically nothing.)

Germany’s Federal Ministry for the Environment donated between $1 million and $5 million to the Clintons during the third quarter of 2016. 
And just days ago Germany’s CDU and CSU parties issued a warning to Russia not to interfere with the affairs and political processes in other countries, especially as Germany prepares for next year’s national election.
Surprise: it turns out that if any country has been attempting to skew the US election, it is Germany itself.
The country’s Federal Ministry for the Environment, a powerful arm of the German government, is reported here to have made a donation to the tune of 1 – 5 million dollars to the Clinton Foundation in the third quarter of 2016, i.e. right at the very peak of the presidential campaign.
Daniel Wetzel at the online national daily Die Welt here reports:
According to a donor list from the ‘Clinton Foundation’ the Ministry transferred between 1 million and 5 million dollars.”

Wetzel asks:
Why does Germany have to finance the US election campaign?”
The donation has come under fire from critics — Wetzel writes — such as former parliamentarian Vera Langenfeld at her blog:
Why is a German federal ministry supporting the election campaign of an American candidate? Obviously the German taxpayers have to finance Hillary Clinton’s campaign without their knowledge of it.”
The Ministry, however, denies the charge of having meddled with the US election, stating that it “fundamentally does not make donations” and that the money was for financing projects “within the scope of international climate protection”.
However, the timing of the donation makes the appearance all the more dubious. During the campaign, Clinton was attacked massively by Trump for the huge and frequent donations coming from an array of outside special interests. Trump went on to accuse Clinton of being up for sale.
Overall the German government and press have been openly hostile to Donald Trump’s election victory. In the current Trump-German relations, it has to be said that Germany drew first blood by unfairly smearing Trump as a racist, misogynist and an out-of control rabble-rouser, and refusing to congratulate him or to give him a chance.
As it stands, there’s no reason for Trump to be extend the hand of friendship to the German government, or especially to the media. Germany enjoys a huge trade deficit with the USA and so don’t be surprised if Trump answers by luring German industry to America by offering lower taxes, less red tape and far cheaper energy. Already German electricity rates are approximately three times higher than those in USA.

"Fiji will introduce one of the world’s most ambitious legislative programs to tackle the climate crisis, and has labelled the global community’s decision to set aside the call for global heating to be capped at 1.5C “grossly irresponsible and selfish”. In a speech to the Fijian parliament on Wednesday morning announcing the upcoming climate change act, Fiji’s attorney general and minister for economy and climate change, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, called global heating “a fight for our lives and our livelihoods”.  Sayed-Khaiyum was speaking ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) in Tuvalu next week, which will be attended by leaders of Pacific countries including Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama – a former president of COP23, the UN’s influential climate body, and world leader in the climate fight – and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison. The act will include tighter restrictions on the use of plastics, a framework for Fiji to reduce its emissions to net-zero by 2050, the introduction of a carbon credits scheme and the establishment of procedures for the relocation of communities at risk from the adverse effects of the climate crisis. The attorney general said that at the PIF Fiji would “make the case for more ambition on the part of the island states and our larger neighbours”. Over the years, Bainimarama has regularly criticised Australia for putting its economic interests ahead of environmental concerns and the wellbeing of neighbouring Pacific countries, which are on the frontline of the climate crisis. In 2015, in a blistering attack, Bainimarama said: “The Australian government, in particular, seems intent on putting its own immediate economic interests first … The ‘lucky country’ determined to stay lucky, at least for the short term, at the expense of its unlucky island neighbours.” Sayed-Khaiyum outlined the impact the climate crisis was already having around the world, including the Arctic ice melt, record high temperatures, droughts, floods and wildfires. “And here in the vast Pacific sits our beloved Fiji. Small and increasingly vulnerable as we scan the horizon anxiously year by year for the kind of extreme weather event that three years ago, took the lives of 44 of our loved ones and inflicted damage equal to one third of our GDP,” he said, in reference to Hurricane Winston in 2016. “[T]hat is the grave situation in which we find ourselves through no fault of our own and why this government puts such a strong emphasis on the climate issue.” Sayed-Khaiyum also shed light on discussions at UN climate talks in Bonn in May, during which Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing nations were accused of ignoring a crucial IPCC report that urged action to keep temperatures below 1.5C. “In Bonn in May, we suffered a significant setback when the nations of the world – under pressure from certain fossil fuel producers – set aside the IPCC scientific report endorsing the call for global warming to be capped at 1.5 degree Celsius above that of the pre-industrial age,” he said. Sayed-Khaiyum said the decision was “a blow to our hopes” and “grossly irresponsible and selfish”. The climate change bill, announced by the attorney general on Wednesday, will be introduced to the parliament in the September session, ahead of the UN secretary general’s climate summit. Fiji was the first, and is one of the only governments in the world, to combine their economy and climate change ministries, said Sayed-Khaiyum, who holds both portfolios. “We understand the relationship between a strong economy and a stable climate,” he said. Sayed-Khaiyum said he hoped the legislation would pass parliament with “unanimous support” from MPs to send a clear message to the world about Fiji’s commitment to tackling the climate crisis and that other nations would emulate the legislation."

Ocala, FL (PRWEB) Global Weather Oscillations (GWO) veteran meteorologist David Dilley says in his early forecast that the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season will be stronger than last year – with the potential for 6 named storms making United States landfalls.
It will also be the most dangerous since the 2005 season, which saw 5 hurricane landfalls and 2 tropical storms.
GWO has issued the most accurate preseason predictions of any organization the past 8 years, including last years’ prediction that the “Atlantic Basin” (which includes the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico) – would enter a Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle in 2016.
David Dilley, Senior Meteorologist for Global Weather Oscillations (GWO) – correctly predicted months in advance that GWO’s prediction zones for the Florida Panhandle and Florida’s East Coast northward to North Carolina – would experience hurricane and/or strong tropical storm conditions in 2016, with multiple strikes likely (see GWO’s 2016 hot-spot predictions graphic).
Here is the GWO’s prediction from last year.
As it turned out – 5 named storms made United States landfalls with Hurricane Hermine making landfall on the Florida Panhandle in the Eastern Upper Gulf (see Hot Spots graphic). But more importantly was Hurricane Matthew – a major hurricane that moved north across Haiti and the Western Bahama’s – then hugged the coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina. 1,739 people died from hurricanes in 2016, most of which were from Hurricane Matthew in the Caribbean. The last time the death toll was that high was in 2005 when nearly 4,000 people were killed by hurricanes.

The official hurricane season begins on June 1 and ends December 1. The Atlantic Basin on average has 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2.7 major hurricanes. As predicted by GWO, the 2016 hurricane season was more dangerous and costlier than average. The official season (minus Hurricane Alex in January) – had 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes – and the United States experienced much above normal activity with 5 out of the 14 named storms making landfall in GWO’s predicted Hot Spots, 2 of which were hurricanes (Mathew and Hermine).
2017 prediction
GWO’s Climate Pulse Hurricane Model indicates that 2017 will once again be influenced by a Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle – with very conducive conditions for hurricane development due to the lack of an El Niño, or La Niña conditions. In addition ocean water temperatures continue to run warmer than normal across most of the Atlantic Basin (red and orange in the graphic), and especially in the Caribbean region and the Atlantic near the United States. This warmer ocean water will be conducive for tropical storms and/or hurricanes forming and/or strengthening close to the United States.
Mr. Dilley, a 40-year veteran, also expects the Bermuda-Azores High Pressure Center will be weaker this summer – thus allowing more named storms to maintain strength – or strengthen as they move from east to west across the Atlantic toward the United States.
He believes the upcoming 2017 hurricane season will be stronger than last year, and it will be the most dangerous and costliest in 12 years for the United States.
The upcoming season will have 16 named storms (14 last year), 8 hurricanes (6 last year), and 4 major hurricanes (3 last year). In addition the United States will have the potential for 6 named storms making landfall, the most since the 2005 season that saw 5 hurricanes and 2 tropical storms make landfall.
GWO also expects 3 out of the 6 landfalls will be hurricanes – with 1 or 2 having the potential for being a major impact hurricane. More information is available at GlobalWeatherOscillations.com, or GlobalWeatherCycles.com.
GWO is the only organization that issues detailed predictions two years into the future for 11 United States prediction zones stretching from New England to Texas. GWO’s hot spot zone predictions for the United States have been nearly 87 percent accurate since 2006 – with GWO correctly predicting 1 to 3 years in advance – the occurrences of Hurricane Ike (2008), Irene (2011), Sandy (2012), Matthew and Hermine (2016). Detailed zone and hot spot predictions for the 2017 and 2018 hurricane seasons can be obtained through GlobalWeatherOscillations.com, or GlobalWeatherCycles.com.
GWO and Senior Meteorologist/Climatologist David Dilley is an expert on climate cycles and climate change. A “free” climate change e-book “Earth’s Natural Climate Pulse” (authored by Mr. Dilley) can be acquired through the Global Weather Oscillations web site.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWind Energy Expansion: Endangering Wildlife

Photo from Ferrão da Costa et al., 2017
When pondering the future of wind power and its ecological impacts, it is well worth re-considering this seminal analysis from Dr. Matt Ridley.

[W]orld energy demand has been growing at about 2 per cent a year for nearly 40 years. Between 2013 and 2014, […] it grew by just under 2,000 terawatt-hours.
If wind turbines were to supply all of that growth but no more, how many would need to be built each year? The answer is nearly 350,000, since a two-megawatt turbine can produce about 0.005 terawatt-hours per annum. That’s one-and-a-half times as many as have been built in the world since governments started pouring consumer funds into this so-called industry in the early 2000s.
At a density of, very roughly, 50 acres per megawatt, typical for wind farms, that many turbines would require a land area half the size of the British Isles, including Ireland. Every year. 
If we kept this up for 50 years, we would have covered every square mile of a land area half the size of Russia with wind farms. Remember, this would be just to fulfill the new demand for energy, not to displace the vast existing supply of energy from fossil fuels, which currently supply 80 per cent of global energy needs.  

The profound costs to wildlife of future-planning to expand wind energy to the levels demanded by “green” advocates — just to meet the world population’s additional energy demands with 350,000 more turbines each year — has been increasingly documented by scientists.
The last remaining vulture species native to southeastern Europe is “likely” faced with extinction in the next few decades due to an “eight to ten times greater” mortality rate associated with the rapid expansion of wind energy projects in the region (Vasilakis et al., 2017).
Bat species can be found dwelling in a wide variety of terrestrial habitats, including deserts and along sea coasts. Each species may play a fundamental role in its local ecosystem.  For example, Kuntz et al., (2011) indicate that 528 different plant species rely on bat pollination and seed dispersal for sustainability.  Boyles et al., (2011) estimated that by controlling pest populations (insects), the agricultural benefits of bats may reach $22.9 billion (U.S.D.) annually in the continental U.S. alone.
In addition to White Nose Syndrome, deaths  connected to collisions with wind turbines are now the leading cause of multiple mortality events in bats (O’Shea et al., 2016).  Roughly 25% of North American bats are now classified at risk for extinction (Hammerson et al, 2017), in large part due to the explosion of wind turbines across the landscape.   If the expansion of wind turbines continues at its current pace, the hoary bat population is projected to be reduced by 90% (Frick et al., 2017) within the next 50 years.   As Hein and Schirmacher (2016) conclude, the “current and presumed future level of fatality [for bat populations] is considered to be unsustainable.”

Even large mammals like the already endangered Portuguese wolf  (“between 200 and 400 individuals” left) has had its reproduction rates reduced by the recent addition of nearly 1,000 new turbines in their shrinking habitat range (Ferrão da Costa et al., 2017 ).
So what, exactly, are we gaining in exchange for increasingly endangering critically important wildlife species?  Slightly above nothing.
According to the IEA, wind energy provided for 0.39% of the world’s total energy demands as of 2013.
At what point may we ask: Are the benefits of wind energy worth the ecological and wildlife costs?

Vasilakis et al., 2017
Numerous wind farms are planned in a region hosting the only cinereous vulture population in south-eastern Europe. We combined range use modelling and a Collision Risk Model (CRM) to predict the cumulative collision mortality for cinereous vulture under all operating and proposed wind farms. Four different vulture avoidance rates were considered in the CRM.  Cumulative collision mortality was expected to be eight to ten times greater in the future (proposed and operating wind farms) than currently (operating wind farms), equivalent to 44% of the current population (103 individuals) if all proposals are authorized (2744 MW). Even under the most optimistic scenario whereby authorized proposals will not collectively exceed the national target for wind harnessing in the study area (960 MW), cumulative collision mortality would still be high (17% of current population) and likely lead to population extinction.

Hammerson et al, 2017
Conservationists are increasingly concerned about North American bats due to the arrival and spread of the White-nose Syndrome (WNS) disease and mortality associated with wind turbine strikes. To place these novel threats in context for a group of mammals that provides important ecosystem services, we performed the first comprehensive conservation status assessment focusing exclusively on the 45 species occurring in North America north of Mexico. Although most North American bats have large range sizes and large populations, as of 2015, 18–31% of the [North American bats] species were at risk (categorized as having vulnerable, imperiled, or critically imperiled NatureServe conservation statuses) and therefore among the most imperiled terrestrial vertebrates on the continent.

Frick et al., 2017
Large numbers of migratory bats are killed every year at wind energy facilities. However, population-level impacts are unknown as we lack basic demographic information about these species. We investigated whether fatalities at wind turbines could impact population viability of migratory bats, focusing on the hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus), the species most frequently killed by turbines in North America. Using expert elicitation and population projection models, we show that mortality from wind turbines may drastically reduce population size and increase the risk of extinction. For example, the hoary bat population could decline by as much as 90% in the next 50 years if the initial population size is near 2.5 million bats and annual population growth rate is similar to rates estimated for other bat species (λ = 1.01). Our results suggest that wind energy development may pose a substantial threat to migratory bats in North America. If viable populations are to be sustained, conservation measures to reduce mortality from turbine collisions likely need to be initiated soon. Our findings inform policy decisions regarding preventing or mitigating impacts of energy infrastructure development on wildlife.

Hein and Schirmacher, 2016
Two recent attempts were made to estimate bat fatality in the United States for 2012. Hayes (2013) followed a similar approach to Cryan (2011) and based his analysis primarily on the limited dataset from Arnet et al. (2008). Hayes (2013) indicated that >600,000 bats were killed at wind energy facilities in 2012 and suggested that this was a conservative estimate. Smallwood (2013) estimated up to 888,000 bats were killed in the United States in 2012. … We suggest that each of these be considered an order of magnitude estimate; taken together, they highlight the almost certain large number of bats being killed (i.e., on the order of hundreds of thousands per year) in the United States and Canada. Given that bats have a low reproductive rate—typically only having 1 or 2 pups/year—and require high adult survivorship to avoid population declines (Barclay and Harder 2003), this level of impact presumably puts bat populations at risk. Moreover, many species were thought to be declining prior to the onset and expansion of wind energy development, including species impacted by white-nose syndrome (Winhold et al. 2008, Frick et al. 2010). Although population data are sparse or lacking for many bat species, current and presumed future level of fatality is considered to be unsustainable, and actions to reduce impact of wind turbines on bats should be implemented immediately.

Ferrão da Costa et al., 2017
Over the last 15 years, more than 900 wind turbines were built inside the range of the Portuguese wolf. Due to the endangered status of this large carnivore in Portugal, several monitoring plans were conducted, resulting in a reasonable amount of information being collected on the effects of wind farms on wolves. We reviewed the methodological approaches, compiled major findings and summarised the mitigation/compensation measures used in Portuguese wind farms. The overall outcomes show increasing human disturbance in wind farm areas, resulting in lower wolf reproduction rates during construction and the first years of operation, as well as shifts in denning site locations of more than 2.5 km away from the wind farm. … According to a review by Lovich and Ennen (2013), the construction and operation of wind farms have both potential and known impacts on terrestrial vertebrates, such as: (i) increase in direct mortality due to traffic collisions; (ii) destruction and modification of the habitat, including road development, habitat fragmentation and barriers to gene flow; (iii) noise effects, visual impacts, vibration and shadow flicker effects from turbines; (iv) electromagnetic field generation; (v) macro and microclimate change; (vi) predator attraction; and (vii) increase in fire risks.

"As the leaders of Pacific countries step off their planes at Funafuti airport this week for the Pacific Islands Forum, they are being met by the children of Tuvalu, who sit submerged in water, in a moat built around the model of an island, singing: “Save Tuvalu, save the world.” The welcome sets the tone for a Pacific Islands Forum meeting that will not only have climate change at the top of the agenda – as it has been for many years – but is being hosted by a country that the UN says is one of the most vulnerable to rising sea levels, which could render it uninhabitable in the coming century.  Apart from the important symbolism, Tuvalu’s hosting of the event presents considerable logistical challenges for the nation, as more than a dozen world leaders and an estimated 600 people will descend upon the country with a population of just 11,000. Tuvalu, which is roughly three hours north of Fiji, is also grappling with an ongoing outbreak of dengue fever, the fact it has no supply of safe fresh water, and the fact that it is designated by the UN as a least-developed country. There are only three commercial flights a week to Tuvalu, so most attendees have had to fly in on chartered military planes and roughly 75% of all the accommodation that is being used for the forum has been constructed for the event. Pacific leaders, including the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, who both arrive on Wednesday, will be staying in bungalows. Other delegates and officials are being housed in grey two-storey demountable buildings along the length of the island’s airport runway, which runs almost the entire length of the island and as the largest plot of land also gets used for football games, drying clothes and for people to sleep on. “Tuvalu taking on this task, it’s mammoth – everything won’t be perfect, but it will be [done] with the warmth and generosity of island people,” Dame Meg Taylor, the general secretary of the PIF, said on Sunday in Funafuti. “I think Tuvalu has been courageous to host this meeting,” she said. The Tuvaluan prime minister, Enele Sopoaga, told Guardian Australia that hosting the conference, which officially begins on Tuesday, was an opportunity the country could not pass up. “The people of Tuvalu are very, very strong, they are very firm that they want to protect and save their island and their people and their way of life and their resources,” said Sopoaga. “So they are looking at the forum as an opportunity to showcase their resilience.” Morrison is likely to come under pressure from leaders of Pacific island nations, who have repeatedly criticised Australia for what they see as insufficient action to address the climate crisis. Sopoaga said the Australian prime minister was a welcome guest in his country and he anticipated “positive and progressive discussions”, but said he had concerns about Australia’s coalmining policy and its use of carryover credits as a means of reducing emissions and said the positive relationship could change if the future of his people was not taken seriously. “I hope we can be more understanding that the people of Tuvalu and small island countries are already submerged, are already going underwater,” Sopoaga said. “If our friend Australia does not show them any regard, any respect, it is a different thing, we cannot be partner with that thinking. I certainly hope we do not come to that juncture to say we cannot go on talking about partnerships regardless of whether it is [the Australian government’s Pacific] Step-Up or [New Zealand’s Pacific] Reset, while you keep pouring your coal emissions into the atmosphere that is killing my people and drowning my people into the water.” Another key issue that may see Australia on opposing sides to its Pacific neighbours is that of human rights abuses in West Papua. A delegation from West Papua, including the Papuan independence leader Benny Wenda, was due to attend the forum as part of the Vanuatu government’s delegation, but as of Sunday afternoon the West Papuan group had not been able to arrive in Tuvalu, with both Sopoaga and Taylor saying they knew nothing about the delegation’s difficulties in reaching the country. Australia is strongly supportive of Indonesian sovereignty over Papua, while the independence movement has widespread support among several key Pacific island nations – particularly Melanesian neighbours Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. The forum may also mark a shift in the power balance of the forum. This year will be the first time a Fijian prime minister has attended the summit since the country was suspended in 2009 for refusing to call elections. Though Fiji was reinstated into the forum in 2014, its prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, has never attended, saying in 2010 that he would not attend while Australia and New Zealand were part of the group because they wielded too much influence, telling the ABC: “I don’t think they should be in the forum, they’re not Pacific islanders.” Bainimarama presided over the UN’s leading climate change body in 2017, COP23, and is a high-profile global figure in the fight against global heating and will lend strength to other Pacific leaders such as Sopoaga and the Marshall Islands president, Hilda Heine, who are also key Pacific figures in this debate. China’s battle for influence in the Pacific region is also likely to emerge as a key theme during discussions. Tuvalu is one of a handful of countries in the world – several of which are located in the Pacific – that have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, rather than mainland China, which is not a member of PIF but will send a delegation as a dialogue partner. The PIF secretariat will likely be looking to make sure there is not a repeat of last year’s events, when the Chinese delegation walked out of one of the talks during the PIF meeting in Nauru, which also has diplomatic relations with Taiwan. China’s presence in the region also might mean Australia finds itself with far less leverage than it once did, says the Australia-based Pacific analyst Tess Newton Cain. “This is the first time that I can remember that Australia hasn’t been able to play the money card, and say: ‘what if we took our aid money away? What if we didn’t pay for that?’” she says. “Fiji and Vanuatu would say ‘well do what you like, I’m off to Beijing next week’.” Because of Australia’s potentially reduced leverage in the region and the increasing gulf between Australia and its Pacific neighbours on climate change, the meeting is likely to throw into relief questions about the identity of the Pacific Islands Forum, the region and Australia’s place in it. “From what I can see, I don’t see that Morrison has a mandate to give Pacific leaders what they say they want,” said Newton Cain. “It wasn’t long ago that Australia was saying they wanted to be a leader in this region,” she said. “They don’t say that anymore, the question is, do they even want to be on the team, is there even a place for them on the team, not to mention the captain of the team?”"
"We tend to learn better from experience than from what we have simply been told. So for many in Europe, sleepless nights and suffocating buses or workplaces have helped to make real the threat posed by global heating. Now statistics are reinforcing the message. Last week the UK had the hottest day on record: 38.7C in Cambridge. New records were set in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in July, and June was the hottest month in US history. The Met Office says that the UK’s 10 hottest years on record have all been since 2002. Heatwaves naturally occur in summer, but they did not used to be so hot, or so frequent. Experts say that the UK’s sweltering weather last summer was made 30 times more likely by global heating. That link has sunk in: in a new survey, 77% believed the recent heatwave was partially or wholly caused by the climate crisis. As temperatures reach unprecedented levels, so does public concern about the environment.  Yet while global heating is just that, its impact varies even within countries. Most people surveyed in July considered the weather too hot. But, while 73% of people in the east of England judged it too hot, in chillier Scotland only 47% of people agreed – and a slightly larger proportion thought it just right or not warm enough. Some may look forward to warmer staycations and the chance to grow grapes in their back garden. Even those alarmed by July’s heat may not envision the full scale of the climate crisis. The connection between global heating and heatwaves seems self-evident. It’s intuitively harder to link it to other extreme weather events, and to take in experts’ warnings that Britain seems to be getting wetter as well as warmer. It’s more difficult still to fully comprehend how harsh its impact will be elsewhere. For many people, even a small rise in temperatures will be catastrophic. A new report from Monash University in Melbourne warns that the climate crisis is already causing deaths; one of its authors said almost 400 people died from heat stress and heatstroke during fires in Victoria 10 years ago. It predicts climate-related stunting, malnutrition and lower IQ in children within the coming decades; a 2018 report from the World Health Organisation predicted that an additional 250,000 deaths a year will occur between 2030 and 2050 due to global heating. Some places will experience more severe temperature shifts or will find it harder to adapt than others, often through lack of resources. Poorer countries, which broadly speaking are the least to blame for the climate crisis – emitting less carbon dioxide per capita – will suffer most. A hurricane or wildfire is deadlier when there is little capacity to prepare for it or to speed recovery. Families that spend most of their income on food struggle to eat when crops suffer. A recent study found that global heating has already increased global inequality: in most poor countries, higher temperatures are very likely to have resulted in lower economic output than they would otherwise have enjoyed, while richer nations were not harmed to the same degree, and some were potentially able to actually benefit. Bangladesh and sub-Saharan African nations are among those hit. The research ties in with previous projections that by 2100 the average income in the poorest countries will be 75% lower than it would be without climate change, and that some wealthy countries might even see higher incomes. Yet none of these problems will be fully contained within national borders. Drought and famine are already forcing families from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to attempt to migrate to the United States when they are unable to feed themselves. A World Food Programme study of Central American migrants found that almost half were food insecure. A 4C rise this century, which is now considered a realistic prospect, would produce at least 300 million refugees and drown cities in the US and China. It is the duty of richer nations to do all they can to hold back the soaring temperatures which they did most to produce, and to take what action they can to mitigate their impact – abroad as well as at home. It is also in their self-interest."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s DWD national weather service just issued the preliminary results for the country’s January 2017 mean temperature.
According the DWD’s approximately 2000 stations scattered across the country, January’s mean temperature came in 2.7°C colder than the 1981-2010 mean. Especially southern Germany was cold, as was its neighbor Austria, see below.
The lowest recorded temperature in Germany was measured in Reit im Winkl: -26.3°C. Most of the precipitation this past January, which was 27% below normal, fell as snow.
The DWD attributed the colder temperatures to a wintry weather pattern.
No warming
The European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) has analyzed the German data for the Erfurt-Weimar station and has found that there has been no warming in January over the past 45 years (since 1973):

Despite rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, January temperature at the Erfurt-Weimar station has remained flat since 1973. Chart: Stefan Kämpfe, EIKE.
Josef Kowatsch also analyzed Germany’s January temperature trend and found that the month has in fact cooled almost 2°C over the past 25 years. I’ll see if I can chase down his chart.

EIKE also looked at the Central England January temperature record and found that there has only been a slight warming over the past 105 years!
In fact the warmest years in Central England were recorded in the early part of the 20th century.

"Instead of letting your dirty dishwater go down the drain, consider using it to water the trees on your street. That is the message from tree experts, who say survival rates for urban trees could be boosted significantly by volunteers. Russell Miller, a London-based arboricultural consultant, said: “If you plant trees from good stock, at the right time, and provide enough water, you’d lose almost none prematurely. But get that wrong, and more than half can die.”  Miller says a big issue is that local council budgets often do not stretch to include proper watering, which is critical in the first three years of a tree’s life. “Watering is less sexy than planting. It’s cheaper to replace them,” he said. New street trees need at least 20 litres of water a week – about two large watering cans – from April to September, especially in hot weather, says Miller. Any tap or grey water, including dishwater, bathwater and water from washing cars, windows and even clothes, is fine, as long as it does not contain bleach. England’s tree-planting fell 71% short of government targets last year, with just over 2m planted. Last October, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, announced a £60m scheme to plant 10m trees, including 130,000 urban trees. But there are concerns that both the money and trees could go to waste unless the right aftercare is prioritised. “The idea is not just to plant a million trees, but to establish a million trees,” warned Tony Kirkham, arboretum head at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew. Most species of street tree, such as the London plane, are chosen especially for their resilience and tolerance of urban stress. But even these species need years to develop root systems that can find their own sources of moisture among the networks of cables and pipes, and compacted soil under pavements and roads. “Once street trees get stressed it’s difficult for them to bounce back, they really struggle, and have to rely on rain falling the following year,” Kirkham explained. “If this doesn’t happen, the problem is compounded from year to year.” Citizen-led projects are making an impact, and some local councils, including Cambridge, Sheffield, Camden, Kingston-upon-Thames, Waltham, Enfield and Richmond, have started social media campaigns, put signs up on trees and sent out leaflets urging residents to water their local trees. “Councils are hoping for rain, and hoping they’ll survive, but there are heavy losses when it comes to urban tree planting. The public can dramatically improve their chances of survival,” said Kirkham. “Anything we can do to relieve the stress on our trees is a massive bonus, for both our local authorities and our trees.”"

"We think of air conditioning as a “first world” luxury, but it’s really more of an American one. In Europe, fewer than 5% of households have air conditioning, according to the International Energy Agency, and even in hot regions like Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, only 8% of households have it. In the US, nearly 90% of households are air conditioned. In New York, where the summer reverberates with the hum of air conditioners, that percentage seems even higher. Along certain avenues, you walk in a sprinkle of condensation dripping from row after row of window units above, never quite sure if you’re supposed to be disgusted. In Queens, where I live, one of my neighbors runs their window unit almost all year long, cooling their apartment in winter against the steam radiator that the landlord keeps on full blast around the clock, and in summer against, well, the summer. The poor unit only gets a couple months of rest a year, in the spring and the fall, though even then the person often runs it in fan mode, probably because the sudden absence of the machine’s roar is so unnerving. I don’t have an air conditioner, and never have. When I mention this to acquaintances, some flat-out don’t believe me; others seem concerned for my health, begging me to accept old window units they have in their closets. My parents offer to wire me money so I can buy one. I don’t decline their offers out of pride, or stubbornness. It really just doesn’t feel that hot to me. Even when the heat index hit 133 this July, I only noticed because of all the people on social media proclaiming they weren’t going to leave the house that day. I have a thermometer on my living room wall, so I know it doesn’t get that hot, never above 95. I sit at my desk in my boxers, drinking iced tea, occasionally swabbing sweat from my neck and chest. (I will admit that the white T-shirt I use for this has become alarmingly yellowed.) I sleep with a fan on me, on low or medium. I don’t know what to say. It ain’t that bad. A recent article in the New York Times (for which, full disclosure, I was interviewed, though my quotes didn’t make it in) pointed out something that I’ve often observed anecdotally: that the perception of thermal discomfort is correlated with GDP. In other words, only rich people whine about the heat, crank the a/c, and then go on Twitter to brag about how they’re not setting foot outside. Everyone else just mops the sweat from their brow and gets on with their lives. Is it my economic bracket, then, that gives me a tolerance for the heat? I’m a writer and, aside from the occasional big year, it’s true I’m wretchedly, comically poor. It’s also true I’ve always lived in crappy old buildings with no central air, where the outlets had that looseness that makes you think a fire will break out if you plug in anything that pulls more juice than a desk lamp. But there’s a natural process at play, too. According to science, your body can actually acclimatize to heat pretty easily. All it takes is one or two weeks of constant sweating and elevated core temperature; your metabolic rate plummets, while your cardiovascular function and sweat rate goes way up, making you a super-efficient ventor of heat. So it’s not that I’m tough, or stoic – in fact, I’m a huge whiner; ask my girlfriend – it’s just that by the time the heat index hit 133 here in New York, I’d been fully acclimatized by a month and a half of sweating it out. But if you’re one of the 90% of Americans with air conditioning, and you sleep and live in an artificially cooled environment, not to mention work eight, nine hours a day in an office – they are notoriously chilly – your body never gets to acclimatize. Those few minutes you spend outside, panting from frigid office to frigid home or vice versa, are going to feel hellish, even if it’s only in the 80s. Air conditioning isn’t the solution – it’s the problem. But then, not all of those 90% of American households with a/c are affluent – not even close. The American insistence on air conditioning comes down to something in the national character, I think. The American aversion to heat is essentially defiant, a conquest of the environment, a refusal to have the temperature dictated to you by the planet. It’s manifest destiny and global imperialism applied to the living room thermostat - the “Don’t Tread On Me” flag, but the snake is in a 64-degree office with windows that don’t open, as the world burns outside. And the world is burning; June was the hottest month in human history, and air conditioning is undoubtedly a factor in that. Hydrofluorocarbons, the refrigerants used in a/c units, are far more potent greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide or methane, and if we continue along at our current pace, a/c alone will use as much electricity by mid-century as all of China uses today. If that power comes from fossil fuels, a/c alone will account for a half-degree Celsius rise in global temperatures. The conventional wisdom is that the main obstacle to pulling out of this nosedive, in the US anyway, is that a lot of people just don’t believe the planet is getting warmer. But I don’t think that’s quite true. Trump and the people like him, the ageing boomers in red states who forward their adult children emails about how climate change is caused by sunspots or is a Chinese conspiracy, don’t actually disbelieve in global warming; they just refuse to be inconvenienced, by facts or blame or responsibility, just as they refuse to be inconvenienced by heat or sweat. That’s why logic doesn’t work on them; you’re arguing against an emotional position, not an intellectual one. The difference is, a hot room won’t usually kill you, but a hot planet will. If you think walking from your office to the subway is sweaty, just imagine how your grandchildren are going to feel in 2060, as they wait in weeks-long lines at the Canadian border, applying for asylum from wildfires and droughts. If we don’t acclimatize voluntarily soon, we’ll be acclimatized eventually by force.

"It’s easy to despair. The scale of the problems we face looms as large as the shadows cast by unpalatable leaders. What stirs some into action for the first time leaves others feeling simply overwhelmed. What can any one person do? When the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put out a landmark report this week, warning that global heating is damaging the ability of the land to sustain humanity, many news outlets summarised it with the injunction: eat less meat. It was an easily relatable way into the story and told audiences what they could do to help – an essential part of tackling the climate crisis. It was certainly a more accessible angle than the lengthy report’s advice on issues such as smallholders and soil protection.  The danger of such an approach is that great demands can become reduced to individual purchasing decisions, conveniently freeing politicians from making unpopular choices or businesses from reducing their profits. It isn’t a coincidence that so many issues are framed as purely personal choices. It is easier to blame dietary ignorance, sloth and greed for soaring levels of obesity than to tackle an obesogenic environment and the powerful “big food” lobby which has helped to create it. It is easier to encourage individuals to take up meditation than to tackle the social and economic factors contributing to many people’s mental health issues. Deforestation has soared in the Amazon, the world’s largest rainforest, under Jair Bolsonaro’s watch. A new report suggests that leases from the Trump administration of public lands and waters for oil and gas drilling could lead to more carbon emissions than the entire European Union contributes in a year. In this context, focusing on dinner plates can sound trivial. Relying on the conscience of individual shoppers is not a substitute for governmental commitments to drastically curb carbon emissions and introduce the laws, taxes and investment which can produce a more sustainable society. But it is a critical part of the solution. Reining in the rise in global temperatures does not depend on Brazil curbing its destruction of the world’s largest rainforest, or on European holidaymakers flying less, or on the US cutting back on fossil fuels. It depends on all these things, and much more – as the IPCC report so devastatingly shows.  Governments and businesses follow as well as lead. They will not introduce policies which they consider political or commercial suicide. But nor will they persist with those which cost them too much support. The history of social movements tells us that ideas which seem radical and bizarre – like granting women the right to vote – can quickly become regarded as normal and even self-evident.  When Greta Thunberg, then an unknown teenager, decided to protest about the climate crisis outside the Swedish parliament, it led to one and a half million students around the world participating in a school strike. The head of Opec called the movement “perhaps the greatest threat” to the oil industry. As Ms Thunberg herself insists, “You cannot have system change without individual change.” In climate activism the “think global, act local” link is both long-established and tangible. But it is also a useful model for other campaigning. However grim the situation, inaction will make it worse. We should be suspicious of attempts to reduce issues to individual consumer choices; mindful of the need for personal changes; and awake to the chance that even small shifts may trigger much greater ones."

"The Whaley Bridge dam scare is a warning of the potentially disastrous consequences of failing to build new infrastructure to cope with the climate emergency, experts have said. As the environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, chaired a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee on efforts to make the dam safe, the government was facing calls for an urgent overhaul of flood defences and water infrastructure. Villiers said the government was ensuring that “everything possible is being done to draw down water levels, fix damage to the dam and protect homes and businesses.” Bob Ward, a policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: “This is an example where our infrastructure is not up to scratch and we are not acting quickly enough to upgrade it. It is a warning to Villiers that she has got to put climate resilience at the top of the government’s list. “It is all very well worrying about Brexit, but without upgrading infrastructure we are going to suffer more and more grave consequences. If you delay on this, all you are doing is setting us up for disaster.” Ward said the government had been “caught on the hop” by the two wettest winters on record, in 2013 and 2015. In response it promised a flood resilience review, but so far it has examined only river flooding and not the impact of surface water flooding. In May the Environment Agency said an increase in extreme flooding events could force thousands of people to move away from coastal regions. Ward said: “We have the flood defence system fit for the climate of the 20th century when we need it fit for the 21st century. We are going to see more record rainfall, more flooding along our coasts and rivers, and we are just not prepared for that.” Paul Sheffield, a senior vice-president at the Institution of Civil Engineers, said incident at the Whaley Bridge dam, which was built in the 1830s, was a “timely reminder that we cannot afford to underinvest in infrastructure”. He said: “Every bit of infrastructure is going to be exposed to more onerous events than it was originally designed for, so it obviously has to be reviewed.” Sheffield, who was a civil engineer on the Maentwrog dam in north Wales, one of the only new concrete dams built in the UK in the last 50 years, said flood defences should be built at least a metre higher. “In Holland whenever they strengthen their sea defence structures they are taking the precaution of building them a metre higher than they were 50 years ago because of the possibility of flood events. This is something the UK government needs to look at. Our flood defences will need to be raised,” he said. The government is due to respond soon to a review by the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC) that urged it to commit to spending 1.2% of GDP on infrastructure and ensure a further 1.8% of GDP is provided by the private sector. Sheffield said much of this potential investment was now in jeopardy. “We just need to be really careful in this country that we don’t frighten overseas investors away from investing in infrastructure,” he said. “Political uncertainty, not only around Brexit but also the meltdown in UK politics, will inevitably make infrastructure investment organisations from overseas more nervous about investing in this country.” The NIC also called for a series of six-year funding programmes until 2050 to ensure UK households were resilient to flooding. The cost to the public purse would be about £1bn annually, but as yet no government minister has adopted the proposals or set about putting what is a long term flood resilience programme into action. Phil Graham, the chief executive of the NIC, said: “Flood resilience is a major issue, it is important for the economy and for society and we are a world away from where we need to be. It requires a long-term, ambitious response because the impacts of climate change are going to make events like this more and more likely, not less and less likely.” Terry Fuller, the chief executive of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management, said: “There is no doubt the UK is nowhere near resilient enough or ready for even the current climate let alone anything we are going to see in the coming decades. The message is getting through [to the government] but whether something is done about it remains to be seen and there is very little doubt that we will see more events like this.”"
"An Australian coalmine has nearly doubled its greenhouse gas emissions in two years without penalty under a Coalition climate policy that promised to put a limit on industrial pollution. Mining company Anglo American was given the green light to increase emissions at its Moranbah North mine, in central Queensland, twice since 2016, according to documents released under freedom of information laws.  The pollution increase was approved under a scheme known as the “safeguard mechanism”, which promised to ensure cuts paid for by taxpayers through the government’s “direct action” emissions reduction fund were not just wiped out by rises elsewhere. The documents show Anglo American was approved to increase its annual emissions from 1.3m tonnes to more than 2.3m tonnes a year. An equivalent cut in carbon pollution to offset that increase would have cost taxpayers $13.7m. The Australian Conservation Foundation, which received the documents, said the failure to impose a hard pollution cap on big companies was the main reason national emissions were rising each year at odds with the government’s pledge at the Paris climate summit. The documents show Anglo American exceeded its safeguard limit of 1.30m tonnes in 2016/17 and would have been required to buy carbon credits to make up the difference but applied to the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the scheme, to have its baseline retrospectively set at 1.36m tonnes. The change was approved in January 2018. In 2017/18, emissions from the site jumped to 2.33m tonnes, a 71% increase in a year. The company was granted a new baseline, confirmed in February this year, that allows it to emit 6.7m tonnes over the three years to June 2020. An earlier analysis by consultants RepuTex found heavy industrial sites covered by the safeguard mechanism had, in total, been approved emissions limit increases of nearly a third. Gavan McFadzean, the Conservation Foundation’s climate change and clean energy program manager, said the Anglo American case showed the government’s climate policies were failing. “For years, experts have warned the so-called safeguards are full of holes and the pollution increase without penalty at Moranbah North is evidence of this,” he said. McFadzean said loopholes in the safeguard mechanism should be eradicated and emissions limits reduced over time, as recommended by government agency the Climate Change Authority. “This is a bare minimum first step towards a comprehensive Australian climate change strategy that will bring down our pollution to zero by 2050,” he said. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, did not directly address questions about the purpose of the safeguard mechanism. In a statement, he said the government was spending $3.5bn on a climate solutions package and had mapped out how it would deliver its Paris commitment. “We will meet our international obligations without wrecking our economy or offshoring jobs and industry,” he said. Moranbah North is a 20-year-old underground mine in the Bowen Basin that produces coking coal for export. More than 90% of its emissions are methane, a potent but relatively short-lived greenhouse gas, released during mining. A spokeswoman for Anglo American said the company had invested in methane capture technology over the past five years, including using the gas for electricity for about 120,000 homes. She said the company supported the operation of the safeguard mechanism and that it was designed to accommodate economic growth. “[It] recognises that as operating conditions materially change at a mine, the comparison point or baseline should be adjusted. In the case of Moranbah North, production has doubled and we are mining in an area that is geologically twice as gassy,” she said. While emissions rise in the industrial sector, the government is struggling to attract interest in its main policy supposed to cut pollution, the emissions reduction fund. At its most recent auction it signed only three contracts for projects that, combined, promise to deliver only 0.06% of the cuts that Scott Morrison says the fund will achieve by 2030. The Coalition has shifted how it describes the safeguard mechanism since it was introduced. In 2016, the then environment minister, Greg Hunt, said it would ensure the emissions reduction fund was not offset by significant increases above business-as-usual levels elsewhere in the economy. A policy document released in February said the mechanism required Australia’s largest emitters to “measure, report and manage” their emissions, not that it would limit pollution. When the scheme began most sites received baselines equivalent to their highest pollution level between 2009 and 2014. Companies that went beyond their baseline had to buy carbon credits to offset the breach. This has happened in a handful of cases. But companies could also apply to increase their baseline if their production levels were expected to rise or they had started operating more recently. After consulting with industry, the government announced in March it would allow all companies to adopt a calculated baseline to “improve operation of the scheme, reduce costs for business and make it fairer and simpler”. Labor promised before the election that if elected it would reduce industrial emissions covered by the safeguard mechanism by 45% by 2030 by setting tougher limits, but did not spell out how it would have reached the goal. The Coalition does not have a target for the safeguard mechanism, and appears to have dropped Greg Hunt’s plan for it to be used to cut industrial emissions by 200m tonnes between 2020 and 2030. The government has a national target of a 26-28% cut by 2030, but most analysts believe it will not reach the target under current policies. Scientists say even this target is not enough for Australia to be playing its part in meeting the goals of the Paris agreement."

Share this...FacebookTwitter“The current eager acceptance of oceanic thermal lag as the ‘explanation’ as to why CO2 warming remains undetected, reemphasizes that the atmosphere cannot warm until the oceans do. The logical implication follows that most current climate models are lacking in relevance; they have not been constructed with ocean surface temperature as the fundamental variable. When the problem is attacked from this view, sensitivity to CO2 is significantly reduced; a position also strongly supported by the available palaeoclimatic data.”  — Ellsaesser, 1984

According to the IPCC (2013), 93% of the heat energy change from global warming can be found in the oceans (AR5, Chapter 3).  Only a tiny fraction of climate change can be accounted for in the atmospheric record, as the heat capacity of the oceans is more than a thousand times greater than the heat capacity of the air.  In other words, the widely-publicized surface air temperature change of about +0.6° to +1.0°C since the 19th century is not the main barometer of whether or not global warming has occurred – – and if it has, by how much.  Global warming (or cooling) is primarily accounted for as a change in ocean heat content, not surface air temperatures.
Climate models that prognosticate what the temperature of the global climate system might be 100+ years from now, or when atmospheric CO2 concentrations reach 560 ppm (doubled pre-industrial levels) are fundamentally flawed, for they presume that CO2 concentration rise (or decline) is a primary determinant of changes in atmospheric temperature change.  It is not.  Because of the magnitude of difference in heat capacity, it is the global ocean that determines the temperature of the air (predominantly), not the other way around.
It therefore needs to be established that (1) CO2 variations and ocean heat content changes are correlated (when CO2 falls, ocean heat/temperatures fall, and vice versa); and if they are correlated, then it still needs to be scientifically established (i.e., via experimental observation and measurement) that (2) ocean heat/temperature changes are primarily caused by CO2 variations.  Just because there is a correlation between two variables does not necessarily mean that one variable is the cause of the other.
So, as mentioned, first we need to establish a correlation before we can even consider causation.  And when it comes to a correlation between CO2 variations and ocean heat content variations, we don’t have one.  According to scientific studies of long-term ocean heat content, for 99.975% of the last 10,000 years, there has effectively been no significant correlation between rising or falling CO2 concentrations and rising or falling ocean heat.  As will be clarified below, the only period in the last 10,000 years in which CO2 and ocean heat/temperatures sharply rose or fell in concert was the period between 1975 and 2000.
Just 0.09°C – 0.18°C Of Net Warming In 0-2000 m To 0-700 m Ocean Since 1955
Levitus et al. (2012) estimate that, between 1955 and 2010, the global ocean heat energy change (converted to temperature) amounted to an addition of a blistering +0.18°C in the 0-700 m layer, and +0.09°C in the upper 2000 meters of the ocean.  That’s less than one-tenth of one degree over 55 years in the 0-2000 m layer.
Levitus et al., 2012
“The World Ocean accounts for approximately 93% of the warming of the earth system that has occurred since 1955. … The heat content of the World Ocean for the 0–2000 m layer increased by 24.0 ± 1.9 × 1022 J (±2S.E.) [over 1955-2010] corresponding to a rate of 0.39 W m−2 (per unit area of the World Ocean) and a volume mean warming of 0.09°C. … The heat content of the World Ocean for the 0–700 m layer increased by 16.7 ± 1.6 × 1022 J corresponding to a rate of 0.27 W m−2(per unit area of the World Ocean) and a volume mean warming of 0.18°C.”
Below the 2000 m depth (and 52% of the ocean waters reside below 2000 m), the “entirety” of the Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as the Eastern Atlantic have been cooling for the last few decades, largely off-setting the already modest change in the 0-2000 m layer.
Wunsch and Heimbach, 2014
“Over the 20 yr of the present ECCO state estimate, changes in the deep ocean on multiyear time scales are dominated by the western Atlantic basin and Southern Oceans. … In those same regions, a longer-term general warming pattern occurs below 2000 m. A very weak long-term cooling is seen over the bulk of the rest of the ocean below that depth, including the entirety of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, along with the eastern Atlantic basin.”

But let’s consider the contextual magnitude of the 0.18°C of warming in the 0-700 m layer since 1955.  Below is a graph taken from the Rosenthal et al. (2013) paper published in the journal Science documenting the changes in 0-700 m Pacific Ocean heat content during the Holocene.   Pictured are the last 1,200 years (800 C.E. to 2010) of ocean heat changes, including the added blue dotted line on the right extending from 1955 to 2010 (+0.18°C).
As indicated by the black trend bars, notice (a) the amplitude of the rise for the 1900-2010 period is not as steep as 11 previous decadal- and centennial-scale demarcated warming periods during the last 1,200 years.  Also notice that (b) the overall sharp drop in ocean heat since the Medieval Warm Period ended (encompassing the 1200 C.E. to 1900 Little Ice Age) was not accompanied by a sharp decline in CO2 concentrations, and that the Medieval Warm Period had flat, not rising, CO2 levels,  indicating that CO2 variations could not have been a causal factor in the ocean heat content changes during this entire period (800 C.E. to 1900).  Finally, notice that (c) modern temperatures are still tenths of a degree cooler than they were during the 1300 to 1500 C.E. period, when CO2 concentrations still hovered around 280 ppm.  In sum, the data in this graph indicate that there has been no significant correlation between CO2 and ocean heat temperature variations for nearly all of the last 1,200 years.

And yes, the non-correlation includes the 1900-2010 period.  There are very few reconstructions of global-scale ocean heat content prior to 1950 available in the scientific literature.  However, in a paper entitled “Consistent near surface ocean warming since 1900,” Gouretski et al. (2012) provide a comprehensive look at available evidence for the near-surface (0-20 m) change in ocean heat content for the early 20th century.  The supplemental graph below (using the available link [red] from the University of Hamburg) was made available upon the release of the paper.
Gouretski et al., 2012
http://icdc.cen.uni-hamburg.de/uploads/pics/hc_fig2.jpeg
Taking a closer look, the graph shows that the amplitude (+1.3°C) and rate (+0.27°C per decade) of the 1900-1945 ocean warming period was about 4 to 5 times as large as the 1945-2010 warming period (+0.3°C, +0.055°C per decade).

In the paper, Gouretski and co-authors point out that the twenty-first century has experienced a general cooling in large regions of the global ocean — just as anthropogenic CO2 emissions (and atmospheric CO2 concentrations) were rising most dramatically.
“[T]he first decade of the 21st century (2001–2010) was not uniformly warmer than previous decades. Before about 1920, the global ocean was almost everywhere colder than the reference decade of 2001–2010. After 1920, several regions of the global ocean were warmer than the reference decade [2001-2010]. … [A] rather abrupt cooling since the end of 1990s both in the East Pacific (connected to the weakening of El Nino and the shift to the negative phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) and in the Southern Ocean may have contributed to a flattening of the global temperature anomaly series after about 2000. …Decadal mean SST and 0–20 m layer anomalies calculated relative to the reference decade 2001–2010 give evidence of the general warming of the global ocean since 1900. However, large regions of the oceans have experienced cooling since the 1990s. Whereas cooling in the tropical Eastern Pacific ocean is associated with frequent La Nina events in the past decade, the cause of the cooling within the Southern Ocean remains unknown.”
The much larger amplitude and rate of warming that occurred in the early 20th century was not accompanied by a commensurate large change (increase) in anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  In fact, throughout the entire 1900 to 1945 period, human emissions only averaged about 1 gigaton of carbon per year (GtC/yr).  In contrast, human emissions rates rose sharply to 4 GtC/yr by the 1970s, 6 GtC/yr by the 1990s, and over 10 GtC/yr by 2014.  Atmospheric CO2 followed a similar trajectory, as concentrations rose by just 15 ppm in the 40 years between 1900 and 1950 (295 ppm to 310 ppm), whereas concentrations rose by 85 ppm in the 65 years after 1950, including 22 ppm just between the years 2000 and 2010 alone (Feldman et al., 2015) — a decade when near-surface ocean heat “flattened” according to Gouretski et al. (2012).  And despite this explosive increase in human CO2 emissions and atmospheric CO2, the near surface ocean heat content actually cooled between 1945 and 1975, and the rate of warming since 1975 has been much less pronounced than during the 1900-1945 period.

If we were to visually combine the record of the explosive rise in human CO2 emissions since 1945 with the record of near-surface ocean heat content for the entire 1900-2010 period, it would be evident that the only decadal-scale period in which CO2 emissions steeply rose in concert with ocean temperature was during the 25 years between 1975 to 2000.  For 1900-1975 and 2000-2010, there was no obvious correlation between rapidly rising CO2 and ocean heat content.

No Correlation Between CO2 Variations And Ocean Heat For The Entire Holocene
And not only is there a lack of correlation between rising CO2 and rising ocean heat content for all but the 1975-2000 period during the years 800 C.E. through 2010, there is also no correlation between rising CO2 and rising ocean heat for the entirety of the Holocene.  Actually, the general long-term trend is for there to be an inverse correlation: as CO2 rises, ocean heat content declines.   The following Rosenthal et al. (2013) graph of the Pacific Ocean’s 0-500 m layer demonstrates this.


Conclusion
To summarize, in the last 10,000 years, there was one 25-year period (1975-2000) in which CO2 levels and ocean heat content rose in concert.  Other than that, the rest of the last 10,000 years contained no obvious correlation between ocean heat content variations and the rise and fall of CO2 concentrations.  Without a significant long-term (or short-term) correlation between these two variables, we cannot even begin to address the causality question.
Simply put, the presumption that variations in CO2 concentrations cause global warming — net increases in global-scale ocean heat content — has not been established.

==================================
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On July 4 in the journal Atmospheric and Climate Sciences an article by Maxim Ogurtsov, Markus Lindholm  and Risto Jalkanen appeared and addressed an important issue. The warming of the last 150 years after the Little Ice Age is often gladly viewed as having 100% anthropogenic causes. Of course this makes little sense because the Little Ice Age was the coldest period of the last 10,000 years and was caused by natural factors such as solar weak phases and volcanic eruptions.
“IPCC makes a large mistake”
And when the sun again strengthens and volcanic eruptions remain at low levels, the earth warms up again. That there is an anthropogenic warming component of course should not be disputed. The warming of the last 150 years is due to a mix of natural and anthropogenic causes. Here the IPCC makes a large mistake when it assumes that the warming has been 100% anthropogenic.
In the study, Ogurtsov and fellow scientists compare the modern warming to the temperature history of the last 10,000 years. Here they find that there had been only a few similar warming phases when looking at the warming of the past 135 years. If one however considers that only half of that warming was natural, then similar warming phases occur on average every few centuries. The authors conclude that the natural component in the models must be taken into account much more. And conversely the role anthropogenic factors must be reduced correspo0ndingly so that a more accurate picture is attained when compared to the real temperature development.
The Abstract:
On the Possible Contribution of Natural Climatic Fluctuations to the Global Warming of the Last 135 Years
A number of numerical experiments with artificial random signals (the second order autoregressive processes), which have important statistical pro- perties similar to that of the observed instrumental temperature (1850-2015), were carried out. The results show that in frame of the selected mathematical model the return period of climatic events, analogous to the current global warming (linear increase of temperature for 0.95˚C during the last 135 years) is 2849-5180 years (one event per 2849-5180 years). This means that global warming (GW) of the last 135 years can unlikely be fully explained by inherent oscillations of the climatic system. It was found however, that natural fluctuations of climate may appreciably contribute to the GW. The return period of climatic episodes with 0.5˚C warming during the 135 years (half of the observed GW) was less than 500 years. The result testifies that the role of external factors (emission of greenhouse gases, solar activity etc.) in the GW could be less than often presumed.”

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
The oceans are the world’s largest water reservoirs, and over 60-year cycles they swallow heat three decades long, and release over the 30 years or so that follow. In the Atlantic this phenomenon is called the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).
Climate models have not been able to correctly account for them, and thus the climate prognoses are fraught with uncertainty.
However, much has been done in the area of ocean cycles research over the past years. The systematic climate impact has finally been accepted by the scientific community. A good example is a paper authored by Dan Seidov et al appearing in the Geophysical Research Letters in May.
Multidecadal variability and climate shift in the North Atlantic Ocean
Decadal variability of ocean heat content (OHC) and temperature trends over ~60 years in the North Atlantic Ocean were analyzed using a new high-resolution ocean climatology based on quality-controlled historic in situ observations. Тwo ~30 year ocean climates of 1955–1984 and 1985–2012 were compared to evaluate the climate shift in this region. The spatial distribution of the OHC climate shift is highly inhomogeneous, with the climate shift being the strongest southeast of the Gulf Stream Extension. This may be caused by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slowdown in conjunction with heaving of warm subtropical water. The 30 year climate shift shows higher OHC gain in the Gulf Stream region than reported in shorter timescale estimates. The OHC change is generally coherent with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index. This coherence suggests that quasi-cyclicity of the OHC may exist, with a period of 60 to 80 years, superimposed on the slow basin-wide warming trend.”
Finally climatic mid-term prognoses are able to benefit from the ocean cycles, which some five years ago – when our book “The Neglected Sun” was published – we were viciously attacked by the somewhat humiliated climate establishment.
Today we are far better informed. In Ireland temperatures and precipitation are 90% related to the AMO, as McCarthy et al. documented in the journal ‘Weather‘ in July 2015:
The influence of ocean variations on the climate of Ireland
The influence of the ocean circulation on the climate of Ireland is more subtle than it first appears. Temperatures in Ireland are warmer than similar Pacific maritime climates. It is heat – carried primarily in the Atlantic overturning circulation – released over the Atlantic that provides this additional warmth. We investigate variations in Irish climate using long-term station-based time series. The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) explains over 90% of the pronounced decadal temperature and summer precipitation variation. Understanding the impact of these ocean variations when interpreting long climate records, particularly in the context of a changing climate, is crucial.”
The natural decadal variability of the Irish climate is two times more than the warming trend the study shows. In the years of 1990-2002 variability contributed to the trend. It is not stated, but it is warned of the other downward side of the temperature signal flank:
Otherwise, decades of cooling can be seen as a contradiction to increased surface temperature trends (in response to continually increasing greenhouse gas emission) when natural ocean variability may be the cause.”
Models that well reproduce the rising flank of the AMO, and attribute it solely to CO2, overestimate CO2. Even if the full knowledge of the different reasons cannot be fully named, the profound importance of the ocean cycles and their contribution to the warming phases is emerging more and more.
A paper Bowene et al appeared in the PNAS in May, 2017. In it the authors did not dare to examine the current cycle and instead chose to look at an earlier cycle. Their message: The warming of the early 20th century in the Arctic was enhanced by ocean cycles. What follows is the press release from Kyoto University (via Science Daily):
Scientists uncover a cause for early 20th century Arctic warming
Is a warmer Arctic a canary of global warming?
Since the 1970s the northern polar region has warmed faster than global averages by a factor or two or more, in a process of ‘Arctic amplification’ which is linked to a drastic reduction in sea ice. But then how to explain a similar rapid warming that occurred during the early 20th century, when the effects of greenhouse gases were considerably weaker than today? And what can we prove about the period, given the scarcity of usable data and observations prior to the 1950s? Now scientists from Kyoto University and UC San Diego have discovered that this phenomenon occurred when the warming phase — ‘interdecadal variability mode’ — of both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans coincided. The team’s findings appeared recently in the journal PNAS.
“We found that early 20th century sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific and North Atlantic had warmed much more than previously thought,” explains lead author Hiroki Tokinaga of Kyoto. “Using observations and model simulations, we’ve demonstrated that rising Pacific-Atlantic temperatures were the major driver of rapid Arctic warming in the early 20th century.” Previous explanations for early Arctic warming have including decreased volcanic aerosols and increased solar radiation, but none of these have been able to simulate observed conditions from the period.
Tokinaga’s team found that when the interdecadal rise in sea surface temperatures was included in simulation calculations, the results properly reflected early Arctic conditions. “Coupled ocean-atmosphere simulations also support the intensification of Arctic warming,” continues Shang-Ping Xie of UCSD, “which was caused by a concurrent, cold-to-warm phase shift of Pacific and Atlantic interdecadal modes.” The researchers explain that these new findings can help constrain model climate projections over the Arctic region.
“It is likely that temperatures in the Arctic will continue to rise due to anthropogenic global warming,” concludes Tokinaga. “Our study does not deny this. We are rather suggesting that Arctic warming could accelerate or decelerate due to internal variability of the Pacific and the Atlantic.” “It is a challenge to accurately predict when the next big swing of multidecadal variability will occur. Careful monitoring is essential, given the enormous impact on the Arctic climate.”

In September 2015 Judith Curry discussed a paper by McCarthy et al., which projected an imminent change of the AMO to the negative, cooling AMO phase:
Ocean impact on decadal Atlantic climate variability revealed by sea-level observations
Decadal variability is a notable feature of the Atlantic Ocean and the climate of the regions it influences. Prominently, this is manifested in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in sea surface temperatures. Positive (negative) phases of the AMO coincide with warmer (colder) North Atlantic sea surface temperatures. The AMO is linked with decadal climate fluctuations, such as Indian and Sahel rainfall1, European summer precipitation2, Atlantic hurricanes3 and variations in global temperatures4. It is widely believed that ocean circulation drives the phase changes of the AMO by controlling ocean heat content5. However, there are no direct observations of ocean circulation of sufficient length to support this, leading to questions about whether the AMO is controlled from another source6. Here we provide observational evidence of the widely hypothesized link between ocean circulation and the AMO. We take a new approach, using sea level along the east coast of the United States to estimate ocean circulation on decadal timescales. We show that ocean circulation responds to the first mode of Atlantic atmospheric forcing, the North Atlantic Oscillation, through circulation changes between the subtropical and subpolar gyres—the intergyre region7. These circulation changes affect the decadal evolution of North Atlantic heat content and, consequently, the phases of the AMO. The Atlantic overturning circulation is declining8 and the AMO is moving to a negative phase. This may offer a brief respite from the persistent rise of global temperatures4, but in the coupled system we describe, there are compensating effects. In this case, the negative AMO is associated with a continued acceleration of sea-level rise along the northeast coast of the United States9, 10.”
Let’s take a look at the current AMO curve from the NOAA:

Fig. 1: The AMO ocean cycle curve. Status: 1 September 2017. Source: NOAA.
When one looks at the previous AMO cycle, a peak in the AMO could last another decade, just as we projected in our “The Neglected Sun” book. However the PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) is already falling, which will mean cooling globally over the coming years.

Climate publicity seeker Mojib Latif is by the way also a co-author of a study by Klöwer et al. from 2014. In the paper the authors projected similarly as we did in our “The Neglected Sun” book, namely that the AMO plateau would continue with a slight downward trend, i.e. slight cooling:

Fig. 2: AMO prognosis by the Latif group (from: Klöwer et al. 2014)

Fig. 3: AMO prognosis from our “The Neglected Sun” (book 2012).
So why doesn’t Latif mention this when speaking before the next industry group? Here’s the paper’s abstract:
Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and the prediction of NorthAtlantic sea surface temperature
The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a major current system in the Atlantic Ocean, is thought to be an important driver of climate variability, both regionally and globally and on a large range of time scales from decadal to centennial and even longer. Measurements to monitor the AMOC strength have only started in 2004, which is too short to investigate its link to long-term climate variability. Here the surface heat flux-driven part of the AMOC during 1900–2010 is reconstructed from the history of the North Atlantic Oscillation, the most energetic mode of internal atmospheric variability in the Atlantic sector. The decadal variations of the AMOC obtained in that way are shown to precede the observed decadal variations in basin-wide North Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST), known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) which strongly impacts societally important quantities such as Atlantic hurricane activity and Sahel rainfall. The future evolution of the AMO is forecast using the AMOC reconstructed up to 2010. The present warm phase of the AMO is predicted to continue until the end of the next decade, but with a negative tendency.”
The authors write in the paper’s highlights:
North Atlantic sea surface temperature will stay anomalously warm until about 2030.”
But they could have just as well written:
The North Atlantic will cool considerably by 2030.”
Just how the AMO works is a fundamental question, similar to the “hen and the egg”, and remains to be explained. The modelers have not been able to robustly duplicate the cycle. That’s been embarrassing.
In the scientific community a controversial discussion has since broken out. Example: Amy Clement et al in October 2015 in Science:
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation without a role for ocean circulation
The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is a major mode of climate variability with important societal impacts. Most previous explanations identify the driver of the AMO as the ocean circulation, specifically the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Here we show that the main features of the observed AMO are reproduced in models where the ocean heat transport is prescribed and thus cannot be the driver. Allowing the ocean circulation to interact with the atmosphere does not significantly alter the characteristics of the AMO in the current generation of climate models. These results suggest that the AMO is the response to stochastic forcing from the mid-latitude atmospheric circulation, with thermal coupling playing a role in the tropics. In this view, the AMOC and other ocean circulation changes would be largely a response to, not a cause of, the AMO.
Significance:
Ocean circulation changes not needed
What causes the pattern of sea surface temperature change that is seen in the North Atlantic Ocean? This naturally occurring quasi-cyclical variation, known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), affects weather and climate. Some have suggested that the AMO is a consequence of variable large-scale ocean circulation. Clement et al. suggest otherwise. They find that the pattern of AMO variability can be produced in a model that does not include ocean circulation changes, but only the effects of changes in air temperatures and winds.”
What follows is the corresponding press release from the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science, dated 15 October 2015:
New Study Questions Long-Held Theories of Climate Variability in the North Atlantic
UM Rosenstiel School researchers suggest atmosphere drives decades-long climate variations.
A University of Miami (UM) Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric-led study challenges the prevailing wisdom by identifying the atmosphere as the driver of a decades-long climate variation known as the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO). The findings offer new insight on the causes and predictability of natural climate variations, which are known to cause wide-ranging global weather impacts, including increased rainfall, drought, and greater hurricane frequency in many parts of the Atlantic basin.
For decades, research on climate variations in the Atlantic has focused almost exclusively on the role of ocean circulation as the main driver, specifically the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, which carries warm water north in the upper layers of the ocean and cold water south in lower layers like a large conveyor belt. “The idea of the ocean as the driver has been a powerful one.” said UM Rosenstiel School Professor Amy Clement, the lead author on the study. We used computer models in a new way to test this idea, and find that in fact there is a lot that can be explained without the ocean circulation.”
While the overall rise in average temperature of the Atlantic is caused by greenhouse gases, this study examines the fluctuations occurring within this human-related trend. Identifying the main driver of the AMO is critical to help predict the overall warming of the North Atlantic Ocean in coming decades from both natural and man-made climate change. Recent research suggests that an AMO warm phase has been in effect since the mid-1990s, which has caused changes in rainfall in the southeastern US, and resulted in twice as many tropical storms becoming hurricanes than during cool phases.
Using multiple climate models from around the world, Clement’s research team removed the ocean circulation from the analysis to reveal that variations in the Atlantic climate were generally the same. The AMO results in a horseshoe-shaped pattern of ocean surface temperatures in the North Atlantic Ocean that have been naturally occurring for the last 1000 years on timescales of 60-80 years. This new analysis shows that the pattern of the AMO can be accounted for by atmospheric circulation alone, without any role for the ocean circulation.
“These results force us to rethink our ability to predict decade-scale temperature fluctuations in the Atlantic and their associated impacts on land. It may be that many of the changes have limited predictability, which means that we should be prepared for a range of climate outcomes associated with global warming,” said Clement.
The study, titled “The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation Without a Role for Ocean Circulation,” was published in the Oct 16 issue of the journal Science. The co-authors include Clement, Katinka Bellomo and Lisa N. Murphy from the UM Rosenstiel School; Mark A. Cane of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University; and Thorsten Mauritsen, Gaby Rädel and Bjorn Stevens from Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Germany. The work was support by grants from the Department of Energy and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.”

"The climate crisis is damaging the ability of the land to sustain humanity, with cascading risks becoming increasingly severe as global temperatures rise, according to a landmark UN report compiled by some of the world’s top scientists. Global heating is increasing droughts, soil erosion and wildfires while diminishing crop yields in the tropics and thawing permafrost near the poles, says the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Further heating will lead to unprecedented climate conditions at lower latitudes, with potential growth in hunger, migration and conflict and increased damage to the great northern forests. The report, approved by the world’s governments, makes clear that humanity faces a stark choice between a vicious or virtuous circle. Continued destruction of forests and huge emissions from cattle and other intensive farming practices will intensify the climate crisis, making the impacts on land still worse. However, action now to allow soils and forests to regenerate and store carbon, and to cut meat consumption by people and food waste, could play a big role in tackling the climate crisis, the report says. Such moves would also improve human health, reduce poverty and tackle the huge losses of wildlife across the globe, the IPCC says. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a body of the United Nations. Based in Geneva, it was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme to determine the state of knowledge on climate change.  For each report, the IPCC assembles hundreds of senior scientists from across the world to assess the current state of knowledge. It publishes major 'assessment' reports every 5–7 years, with the next, 'AR6' due in 2022, as well as producing ad hoc special reports. The IPCC has more than 190 member countries, and its reports are drafted and reviewed in several stages to guarantee their quality, with member governments signing off the final versions. The ""Principles Governing IPCC Work"" states it will assess: In October 2018 it published a special report analysing current climate research stating that we have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe, and that urgent changes are needed to cut risk of extreme heat, drought, floods and poverty. Burning of fossil fuels should end as well to avoid “irreversible loss in land ecosystem services required for food, health and habitable settlements”, the report says. “This is a perfect storm,” said Dave Reay, a professor at the University of Edinburgh who was an expert reviewer for the IPCC report. “Limited land, an expanding human population, and all wrapped in a suffocating blanket of climate emergency. Earth has never felt smaller, its natural ecosystems never under such direct threat.” Piers Forster, a professor at the University of Leeds, said: “This important report shows we need to substantially change the way we use our land to limit temperature change below 1.5C. In a nutshell we need less pasture [for livestock] and more trees.” The land-use advice was contained in an IPCC report in October. Prof Jim Skea, from the IPPC, said the land was already struggling and climate change was adding to its burdens. Almost three-quarters of ice-free land was now directly affected by human activity, the report says. Poor land use is also behind almost a quarter of the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions – the destruction of forests, huge cattle herds and overuse of chemical fertilisers being key factors. Emissions relating to fertilisers have risen ninefold since the early 1960s. Rising temperatures are causing deserts to spread, particularly in Asia and Africa, and the Americas and Mediterranean are at risk, the report says. One of the most stark conclusions in the IPCC report is that soil, upon which humanity is entirely dependent, is being lost more than 100 times faster than it is being formed in ploughed areas; and lost 10 to 20 times faster even on fields that are not tilled. The report recommends strong action from governments and business, including ending deforestation and enabling new forests to grow, reforming farming subsidies, supporting small farmers and breeding more resilient crops. Many of those solutions, however, would take decades to have an impact, the IPCC says. Consumers in rich nations could act immediately by reducing their consumption of intensively produced meat and dairy foods – products that have a huge environmental impact. “There is much more we could do in that space that we are not doing, partly because it is difficult,” said Pete Smith, a professor at the University of Aberdeen and a senior IPCC author. “You wouldn’t want to tell people what to eat, that would go down badly. But you could incentivise.” The IPCC report suggests “factoring environmental costs into food”. Previous studies have suggested meat taxes, or subsidised fruit and vegetables. Meat production ties up most farmland and cutting consumption could release millions of square kilometres for forestry or bioenergy crops, the report says, as could cutting food waste. Caterina Brandmayr, of the Green Alliance thinktank, said: “The key message from the IPCC is urgency: we need to act now to plant new forests, restore our ecosystems, and, yes, to eat less meat.” David Viner, a professor at the University of East Anglia and a senior IPCC author, said: “Land is a vital resource and we have to look after it if we are going to have a sustainable future.”"
"Healthy land provides the food, timber and fresh water essential to humanity’s survival, but a UN report says the climate crisis is damaging this precious resource with potentially irreversible consequences. The abuse of land by razing forests, intensive farming and loss of soils also produces a quarter of global emissions, further worsening the climate emergency, says the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It says ending the degradation of land can play an important role in securing a liveable planet by cutting emissions, providing sustainable food and reducing poverty. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a body of the United Nations. Based in Geneva, it was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme to determine the state of knowledge on climate change.  For each report, the IPCC assembles hundreds of senior scientists from across the world to assess the current state of knowledge. It publishes major 'assessment' reports every 5–7 years, with the next, 'AR6' due in 2022, as well as producing ad hoc special reports.

The ""Principles Governing IPCC Work"" states it will assess: In October 2018 it published a special report analysing current climate research stating that we have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe, and that urgent changes are needed to cut risk of extreme heat, drought, floods and poverty. “What the IPCC highlights is that we urgently need a revolution in the way we currently utilise land,” said Anna Krzywoszynska, of the University of Sheffield. “Food systems today are built not on soil but on the oil needed for chemicals and machinery.” Clare Oxborrow, of Friends of the Earth, said: “The way land is being used and abused is rebounding on us. The scientific evidence is clear: political leaders must transform the way land and resources are used, otherwise life on Earth just won’t be possible.” Land is heating up faster than the oceans: the average surface temperature is now 1.5C higher than in the late 19th century. This is already affecting food security, the IPPC report says, as heat, drought and changes in rainfall damage crops. Prof Pete Smith, of the University of Aberdeen, who was one of the report’s authors, said the food system would not be able to feed the world if global heating surged beyond 2C. “Going into a world where we are way above 2C has massive implications for the food system and production in particular,” he said. “We get more droughts, more people going without food and who need more disaster relief. It’s a place we don’t want to go.”  The burning of fossil fuels is the biggest source of carbon emissions and is still rising, despite the need for urgent cuts. But land use causes a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, half from forest destruction and half from farming, including methane from cattle and rice paddies and nitrous oxide from chemical fertiliser use and manure. The exploitation of land and fresh water today is unprecedented in human history, the IPCC report says. Three-quarters of all ice-free land is used by humans. Rising global population and consumption is driving the loss of 10bn trees a year and meat consumption has doubled since 1961. Intensive farming means soil is being lost 100 times as fast as it is being formed in ploughed fields. However, the IPCC report says solutions exist. Among the most important is halting the destruction of forest, peatlands and wetlands, which store huge amounts of carbon and can absorb more if left undisturbed. “Conserving what we have got is the first thing to do,” Smith said. “It is also a quick win that delivers across a whole range of things we want to do to preserve a liveable planet,” including halting the annihilation of wildlife, which some scientists think is the start of a new mass extinction. Enabling the restoration of forests is also important, as is using farming techniques that preserve rather than erode soils. Cutting the amount of meat and dairy products eaten in rich nations is a “major opportunity”, the IPPC report says, due to the heavy environmental impact of intensively reared cattle. Drastically reducing food waste – 25-30% of all food is never eaten – is a priority as well. Another opportunity is to help smallholder farmers around the world sustainably increase their yields, including by breeding new crop varieties that better withstand heat and drought. Bioenergy crops have been suggested as a way to pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but the IPCC report warns that large-scale use could conflict with growing food, with serious consequences for food security. The report says global heating could boost some crops in higher and cooler latitudes as growing seasons get longer and higher levels of CO2 in the air fertilises plants. “But in terms of global food production and food access it is definitely a net negative,” said Smith, as the most vulnerable populations live at lower latitudes such as in sub-Saharan Africa and India, where fierce temperatures will harm crops. The special role of indigenous people is highlighted in the report. “Finally, the world’s top scientists recognise what we have always known,” said a statement by indigenous and community leaders from 42 countries that account for 76% of the world’s tropical forests. “We play a critical role in safeguarding the world’s lands and forests. The report recognises that strengthening our rights is a critical solution to the climate crisis.” Women must also have stronger rights, the report says, as they often do much of the farming but little of the decision-making. Reyes Tirado, of the Greenpeace Laboratory at the University of Exeter, said: “This is a crisis of our own making but it’s a crisis we can solve if we act now. Changing the way we produce food and what we eat will protect our climate and promote food security.” She said freeing up land used for animal grazing and feed could allow forests to regrow. Katherine Kramer, of Christian Aid, said: “The land sector alone cannot be a silver bullet. The need to end the fossil era as soon as possible remains as clear as ever. [But] we need land to be part of the solution as well.”"

"It’s a tragic missed opportunity. The new report on land by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shies away from the big issues and fails to properly represent the science. As a result, it gives us few clues about how we might survive the century. Has it been nobbled? Was the fear of taking on the farming industry – alongside the oil and coal companies whose paid shills have attacked it so fiercely – too much to bear? At the moment, I have no idea. But what the panel has produced is pathetic. The problem is that it concentrates on just one of the two ways of counting the carbon costs of farming. The first way – the IPCC’s approach – could be described as farming’s current account. How much greenhouse gas does driving tractors, spreading fertiliser and raising livestock produce every year? According to the panel’s report, the answer is around 23% of the planet-heating gases we currently produce. But this fails miserably to capture the overall impact of food production. The second accounting method is more important. This could be described as the capital account: how does farming compare to the natural ecosystems that would otherwise have occupied the land? A paper published in Nature last year, but not mentioned by the IPCC, sought to count this cost. Please read these figures carefully. They could change your life. The official carbon footprint of people in the UK is 5.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person per year. But in addition to this, the Nature paper estimates that the total greenhouse gas cost – in terms of lost opportunities for storing carbon that the land would offer were it not being farmed – of an average northern European diet is 9 tonnes a year. In other words, if we counted the “carbon opportunity costs” of our diet, our total footprint would almost triple, to 14.4 tonnes. Why is this figure so high? Because we eat so much meat and dairy. The Nature paper estimates that the carbon cost of chicken is six times higher than soya, while milk is 15 times higher and beef 73 times. One kilo of beef protein has a carbon opportunity cost of 1,250kg: that, incredibly, is roughly equal to driving a new car for a year, or to one passenger flying from London to New York and back. These are global average figures, raised by beef production in places like the Amazon basin. But even in the UK, the costs are astonishing. A paper in the journal Food Policy estimates that a kilo of beef protein reared on a British hill farm whose soils are rich in carbon has a cost of 643kg, while a kilo of lamb protein costs 749kg. Research published in April by the Harvard academics Helen Harwatt and Matthew Hayek, also missed by the IPCC, shows that, alongside millions of hectares of pasture land, an astonishing 55% of UK cropping land (land that is ploughed and seeded) is used to grow feed for livestock, rather than food for humans. If our grazing land was allowed to revert to natural ecosystems, and the land currently used to grow feed for livestock was used for grains, beans, fruit, nuts and vegetables for humans, this switch would allow the UK to absorb an astonishing quantity of carbon. This would be equivalent, altogether, the paper estimates, to absorbing nine years of our total current emissions. And farming in this country could then feed everyone, without the need for imports. A plant-based diet would make the difference between the UK’s current failure to meet its international commitments, and success. Then there are the nature opportunity costs. A famous paper in Science shows that a plant-based diet would release 76% of the land currently used for farming. This land could then be used for the mass restoration of ecosystems and wildlife, pulling the living world back from the brink of ecological collapse and a sixth great extinction. People tend to make two massive mistakes while trying to minimise the environmental impact of the food they eat. First, they focus on food miles and forget about the other impacts. For some foods, especially those that travel by plane, the carbon costs of transport are very high. But for most bulk commodities – grain, beans, meat and dairy – the greenhouse gases produced in transporting them are a small fraction of the overall impact. A kilo of soya shipped halfway round the world inflicts much less atmospheric harm than a kilo of chicken or pork reared on the farm down the lane. The second mistake is to imagine that extensive farming is better for the planet than intensive farming. The current model of intensive farming tends to cause massive environmental damage: pollution, soil erosion and the elimination of wildlife. But extensive farming is worse: by definition, it requires more land to produce the same amount of food. This is land that could otherwise be devoted to ecosystems and wildlife. Some people try to argue that extensive farming systems – particularly grazing livestock – “mimic nature”. While some livestock farms are much better than others, there are none in this country that look like natural ecosystems. Nature has no fences. It has large predators (wolves, lynx and other species that have been eliminated here on behalf of livestock farming) and a wide range of wild herbivores. In wet temperate nations such as the UK, natural vegetation in most places is dominated by trees. Even the best livestock farms deliver a depleted parody of nature, supporting a small subset of the species that might otherwise occupy the land. If we want to prevent both climate and ecological catastrophes, the key task is to minimise the amount of land we use to feed ourselves, while changing the way the remaining land is farmed. Instead, governments almost everywhere pour public money into planetary destruction. Look at the £500m the UK government proposes to spend on buying up beef and lamb that will be unsaleable after a no-deal Brexit. This reproduces the worst and stupidest policy the European Union ever conjured up: the intervention payments that created its notorious butter mountains and wine lakes. Brexit, for all its likely harms, represents an opportunity to pay landowners and tenants to do something completely different, rather than spending yet more public money on trashing our life-support systems. The IPCC, like our governments, fails to get to grips with these issues. But when you look at the science as a whole, you soon see that we can’t keep eating like this. Are we prepared to act on what we know, or will we continue to gorge on the lives of our descendants? • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"The scene has been set for tense discussions in Tuvalu as Scott Morrison arrives on Wednesday, after his announcement of $500m in climate funding for the Pacific fell flat, with regional leaders saying that no matter how much money Australia put forward there was no excuse for not reducing emissions and closing coalmines. Though the Australian prime minister was not present for the start of the Pacific Islands Forum leaders’ meeting on Tuesday, his country’s presence at the forum has already been strongly felt, with Pacific leaders pointedly calling for Australia to transition rapidly away from coal use.  Morrison’s announcement of $500m over five years in climate resilience and adaptation funding for the region on Monday does not seem to have quietened concerns, with leaders saying the aid, while welcome, does not let Australia off the hook. Enele Sopoaga, the prime minster of Tuvalu and chair of the forum, said on Tuesday money was not enough. “No matter how much money you put on the table, it doesn’t give you the excuse to not to do the right thing, which is to cut down on your emissions, including not opening your coalmines,” he said. “That is the thing that we want to see.” On Wednesday Morrison is expected to have bilateral meetings with Sopoaga, New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern and the prime ministers of the Cook Islands and Vanuatu. The leaders’ retreat, the main event of the forum, will take place on Thursday. It is looking increasingly unlikely that Pacific island leaders, who are calling for commitments to urgent and significant action to tackle the climate crisis, and Australia will reach agreement on a communique that satisfies both groups. Pacific leaders have singled out Australia’s coal policy and its use of carryover credits to meet its obligations under the Paris agreement as issues they want action on. But on Tuesday Alex Hawke, Australia’s minister for international development and the Pacific, who has been in Tuvalu this week, said Australia would not be shifting from its policies.  “We would be lying to say we’re not disappointed, extremely disappointed,” said Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands, who has become a global leader on the issue of climate change. “Because Australia is part of the Pacific Islands Forum, they’re the closest big country to the small Pacific island nations, they’ve been here, they’re here, they understand the situation. So it’s very disheartening that their actions are not parallel with what we know they understand in terms of our situation.” The urgency of the climate emergency is the focus of this year’s forum.. A meeting of the Pacific small island states on Tuesday resulted in a declaration directly challenging some of Australia’s policies, including calling for “an immediate global ban on the construction of new coal-fired power plants and coalmines” and for all countries “to rapidly phase out their use of coal in the power sector”.  Sopoaga said: “We must push forward and seek urgent actions, concrete actions from the global community. I certainly wish our colleagues from Australia and others, will take heed of this imperative, so we can move forward.”  Hawke said Australia was committed to meeting its Paris targets, and would use carryover credits to help it do so. “Australia’s position has been clear and, look, there’s been great respect for Australia’s position in general. People tell us that they want us to do more to help with climate in the region, and we are doing more.” Hawke also referred to a speech by the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, on Monday, at the start of a climate change conference before the forum, in which Bainimarama appealed to Australia “to do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change”. Hawke said: “[Pacific leaders] also tell us they understand our economy is structured certain ways and that to help with the assistance in the Pacific, Prime Minister Bainimarama was clear about this, we have to work through our own economic transition in Australia and the government’s got our own plan to transition our economy into the future.” The minister said the $500m for Pacific countries from 2020 was “the most amount of money that Australia has ever spent on climate in the Pacific”. The money will go toward resilience and adaptation measures in Pacific countries and comes from the existing aid budget, though Hawke would not be drawn about which aid programs would be cut to pay for the new climate and oceans initiative. “The aid budget works in a number of ways, we’ll be reprioritising some of those needs over time,” he said. “Australia is a good partner on climate because we understand from our neighbours the impact that it has. When you stand here in Tuvalu you understand the imperative about the climate and our prime minister will be here, I’m here all week, we’re listening and we’re responding this week to the needs of the Pacific.”"

While it has understandably not received much, if any, media attention, the North Atlantic Ocean has been rapidly cooling since the mid-2000s, or for more than 10 years now.   The longer the cooling trend continues — and scientists are projecting more cooling for the coming decades  —  the more difficult it will be to ignore.   The North Atlantic Ocean is, after all, a key trend-setter for hemispheric- and perhaps even global-scale climate changes.
In their new paper, for example, Reynolds and colleagues (2017) point out that natural fluctuations in heat transport initiated by the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are “directly linked” to precipitation and warming/cooling temperature trends in Africa, Brazil, North America, and Europe.   Not only that, but the authors explain that a centennial-scale reduction in surface heat transport (AMOC) can explain the dramatic reduction in surface temperatures from the warmth of the Medieval Warm Period to the frigid Little Ice Age, which, of course, could imply that centennial-scale increases in surface heat transport could explain warming periods.

Reynolds et al., 2017       Evidence derived from instrumental observations suggest that Atlantic variability, associated with changes in SSTs and fluctuations in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), is directly linked with broader scale climate variability, including Brazilian and Sahel precipitation (Folland et al., 1986 and Folland et al., 2001), Atlantic hurricanes and storm tracks (Goldenberg et al., 2001 and Emanuel, 2005), and North American and European temperatures (Sutton and Hodson, 2005, Knight et al., 2006 and Mann et al., 2009). Furthermore, evidence derived from palaeoceanographic records suggests that a reduction in the meridional heat transport through the surface components of the AMOC was in part responsible for the reductions in temperatures associated with the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 1000–1450) to Little Ice Age (LIA; 1450–1850) transition (Lund et al., 2006, Trouet et al., 2009, Trouet et al., 2012, Wanamaker et al., 2012 and Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2014).

Examining the Reynolds et al. (2017) graph of North Atlantic sea surface temperatures since the early 1800s, we notice that temperatures (shown to have declined by about -0.45 °C since 2005) are colder now than they were in the 1940s and 1950s, and that even the early 1800s had warmer temperatures than now.

Serykh (2016) points out that the warming enjoyed across Europe and Asia between the 1970s and late 1990s may have been associated with natural decadal-scale oscillations in heat transport.   Similar to Reynolds et al. (2017), Serykh’s graph of ocean heat content reveals no net warming in the last 60 years.

Serykh, 2016       A dipole structure of inter-decadal variations in the heat content of the ocean and heat fluxes from the ocean to the atmosphere has been detected in the North Atlantic. The following fact deserves special attention: the cyclonic and anti-cyclonic atmospheric circulation anomalies, as well as the decrease and increase in the ocean heat content, take place concurrently and quasi-synchronously in the Iceland minimum and Azores maximum regions. Owing to this, the western heat transport anomalies along the 50th parallel increase or decrease the transport of heat from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euro-Asian continent, and the climate in Europe and Siberia becomes more marine or more continental. The very fast climate warming of the Euro-Asian continent that began in the 1970s may be associated with the enhanced heat transport from the North Atlantic in this period. This is evident from the fields and time series obtained in the present paper. The hiatus of this warming after 1999 may be due to the decreased heat transfer from the North Atlantic Ocean to the Eurasian territory.



Dramatic Cooling In the North Atlantic (Affecting Global Climate) Linked To Natural Variability, Not Human Influence
Scientists first began highlighting the North Atlantic cooling trend a few years ago.  Hermanson et al. (2014), for example, pointed out that the AMOC modulates the water temperatures in the North Atlantic by driving the transport of warmer (cooler) ocean water on decadal scales.   Using data that extended through 2012, they (correctly) forecast the cooling trend that had begun in the mid-2000s would continue.  It has.

Hermanson et al., 2014       The observed 5 year mean temperature averaged over the upper 500 m of the SPG [Subpolar Gyre, North Atlantic Ocean] [shows] a marked cooling in the late 1960s followed by a period with below average temperatures, and a warming in the 1990s followed by a period with above average temperatures. … The forecasts that were initialized between 2008 and 2012 (crosses) all show a general trend for further decreases in temperature, continuing the observed [cooling] trend. The 2012 forecast spread suggests that the chance of the observed warm SPG mean temperature anomaly of 2003–2007 (0.53) occurring again in 2013–2017 is less than 6%.
To gain further confidence in this forecast we examine the physical mechanisms that control SPG [North Atlantic Ocean] temperatures. Previous studies showed that the 1990s SPG warming was driven by increased convergence of ocean heat transport resulting from an increase in the AMOC, and the 1960s cooling was driven by reduced ocean heat transport convergence following a reduced AMOC. The hindcasts show changes in ocean heat transport convergence, consistent with these earlier events. The forecasts show a continued decrease in ocean heat transport convergence, consistent with a cooling SPG [Subpolar Gyre, North Atlantic Ocean].

A year ago, Robson et al. (2016) published a paper in Nature explaining that the previous warming trend (1995-2005) had “reversed” to a -0.45 °C cooling trend since 2005 (through 2015), and, like Hermanson et al. (2014) and Reynolds et al. (2017), they attributed both the 1995-2005 warming trend and the current cooling trend to the vagaries of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, even pointing out that the trends are not consistent with an anthropogenic influence.

Robson et al., 2016       In the mid-1990s the North Atlantic subpolar gyre warmed rapidly, which had important climate impacts such as increased hurricane numbers and changes to rainfall over Africa, Europe and North America. Evidence suggests that the warming was largely due to a strengthening of the ocean circulation, particularly the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Since the mid-1990s direct and indirect measurements have suggested a decline in the strength of the ocean circulation, which is expected to lead to a reduction in northward heat transport. Here we show that since 2005 a large volume of the upper North Atlantic Ocean has cooled significantly by approximately 0.45 °C or 1.5 × 1022 J, reversing the previous warming trend. … The observed upper ocean cooling since 2005 is not consistent with the hypothesis that anthropogenic aerosols directly drive Atlantic temperatures.


As the introductory graph of the North Atlantic trend shows above, Duchez and colleagues (2016) report that today’s temperatures are colder than they were in the 1950s — up to 2 °C colder than average — and the “most extreme in the modern record [1948-2015].”.
Duchez et al., 2016       [C]old ocean temperatures were the most extreme in the modern record [since 1948] over much of the mid-high latitude North-East Atlantic. … we consider the exceptionally cold ocean surface anomaly that was already in place prior to the onset of the 2015 heat wave. The SST anomaly field for June 2015 shows temperatures up to 2 °C colder than normal over much of the sub-polar gyre with values that are the coldest observed for this month of the year in the period 1948–2015 indicated by stippling. The cause of this cold anomaly has been the subject of widespread interest in the media, we now show for the first time that it can be attributed to a combination of air–sea heat loss from late 2014 through to spring 2015 and a re-emergent sub-surface ocean heat content [cold] anomaly that developed in preceding years.

Chafik et al. (2016) connect the warming-cooling-warming-cooling oscillatory patterns in the North Atlantic to the natural atmospheric forcing associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) (which is symbiotically connected to the AMOC), and they also highlight the recent cooling trend in their graph (ending in 2012).   They further agree with other scientists that the North Atlantic region is “important for global mean temperature warming,” meaning that what happens in the North Atlantic may have broad implications for climate.
Chafik et al., 2016       The multidecadal variability of the North Atlantic Ocean has a strong signal in the sea surface temperature with many global climate linkages [Enfield et al., 2001; Knight et al., 2006]. An even stronger multidecadal signal can be found in the subpolar temperatures and salinities, where the Atlantic Water inflow variations constitute an essential part in the variability [Hátún et al., 2005; Häkkinen et al., 2011a; Reverdin, 2010]. The atmospheric forcing in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean is dominated by the variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), i.e., the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic sector, which modulates the atmosphere-ocean momentum and heat exchanges on a range of temporal scales. The subpolar ocean variability thus appears to be tightly connected to atmospheric forcing and associated basin-scale circulation changes, which together force the subpolar ocean properties toward extremes [Lozier et al., 2008, 2010], either to warm-saline or cold-fresh conditions on multidecadal scales. These regime changes have recently been argued to be important for global mean surface temperature warming acceleration and hiatus [Chen and Tung, 2014; Drijfhout et al., 2014].

Koenigk and Brodeau (2016) point out that Arctic sea ice area and volume changes (decline) in the last 30 years are “dominated by” the natural variability in heat transport (AMOC), and that a cooling trend may be in the works through 2030.

Koenigk and Brodeau, 2016       Decadal variations of Arctic sea ice extent and ice volume are of the same order of magnitude as the observed ice extent reductions in the last 30 years and are dominated by the variability of the ocean heat transports through the Barents Sea Opening and the Bering Strait. Despite a general warming of mid and high northern latitudes, a substantial cooling is found in the subpolar gyre of the North Atlantic under year-2015 and year-2030 conditions. This cooling is related to a strong reduction in the AMOC, itself due to reduced deep water formation in the Labrador Sea.

Still more scientists — Barcikowska et al. (2016) — observe a North Atlantic/tropical Pacific cooling-warming-cooling trend that may presage global temperature implications (cooling) for the coming decade(s).

Barcikowska et al., 2016       If the observations-based component of variability originates from internal climate processes, as found in the model, the recently observed (1970s-2000s) North Atlantic warming and eastern tropical Pacific cooling might presage an ongoing transition to a cold North Atlantic phase with possible implications for near-term global temperature evolution.


The North Atlantic Is Much Colder Now Than When CO2 Levels Were Much Lower
Because it is important to consider context, it should be pointed out that the 1995-2005 warming that occurred in the North Atlantic was not only well within the range of AMOC-driven natural variability, the relative warmth in that decade was still comparatively cold when considering the long-term temperatures for the North Atlantic region.  In fact, scientists have recently determined that the modern temperatures for the North Atlantic are still among the coldest of the last several thousand years — even the last few hundred.
The conspicuous lack of a net warming trend is significant because it is often claimed that anthropogenic CO2 emissions are the predominant cause of warming global ocean waters.  But there is no correlation between net ocean heat or surface temperature changes in the North Atlantic and the dramatic rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions since the 1950s.  Or since the 1850s.   Or since Medieval times.  Or since the Holocene began.

The Ultimate Cause Of Oceanic Temperature Shifts, Climate Change: Solar Variability
In their Nature paper entitled “Solar forcing of North Atlantic surface temperature and salinity over the past millennium”, Moffa-Sánchez et al. (2014) point out that North Atlantic sea surface temperatures have risen and fallen by as much as 3.5°C within only multi-decadal- to century-long time periods several times during the last millennium.  This magnitude and rapidity of oceanic change — which occurred without any significant changes in atmospheric CO2 — is obviously far more pronounced than the tenths-of-a-degree net change (if that) over the last 100 years in the North Atlantic.  It is also wholly inconsistent with the climate modeled presumption that natural variability in ocean temperatures is so small, and the anthropogenic forcing of recent decades is so dominant, that natural variability can be clearly separated from anthropogenic forcing.
Our results reveal abrupt multidecadal to centennial shifts in the temperature and salinity of the NAC [North Atlantic Current] waters of ∼3.5 °C and ∼1.2 °C, respectively, during the past millennium.   
Indeed, the massive increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions since 1950 have occurred during the same period of time that the North Atlantic has undergone essentially zero net temperature changes (as the papers and graphs above illustrate), strongly suggesting that anthropogenic CO2 climate forcing has exerted little to no influence on North Atlantic water temperatures.  This would also effectively rule out a significant anthropogenic influence on hemispheric- and even global-scale climate changes considering the North Atlantic’s seminal role as a climatic pace-setter.
Not only that, but as Smeed et al. (2014) affirm, the abrupt change (reduction) in the AMOC heat transport since the mid-2000s is far more pronounced in magnitude (ten times greater) and rapid than climate models have projected to accrue due to anthropogenic forcing, which also strongly suggests the AMOC (and oceanic heat transport in general) is not modulated by CO2 emissions.
Smeed et al, 2014       Model simulations predict a decrease of the AMOC in the 21st century in response to increasing greenhouse gases of the order of one half a Sverdrup per decade (IPCC, 2007). Our observations indicate that the actual change over the last decade is much greater. The magnitude of the observed changes suggests that they are a part of a cyclical change rather than being directly linked to the projected anthropogenic AMOC decrease.  … We have shown that there was a slowdown in the AMOC transport between 2004 and 2012 amounting to an average of −0.54 Sv yr−1 (95 % c.i. −0.08 to −0.99 Sv yr−1 ) at 26◦ N, and that this was primarily due to a strengthening of the southward flow in the upper 1100 m and a reduction of the southward transport of NADW below 3000 m. This trend is an order of magnitude larger than that predicted by climate models associated with global climate change scenarios, suggesting that this decrease represents decadal variability in the AMOC system rather than a response to climate change.
So if anthropogenic CO2 emissions are not the North Atlantic’s climate control knob, what mechanism does modulate the AMOC, which, in turn, leads to abrupt multi-decadal- to centennial-scale warming and cooling periods?   Returning to Moffa-Sánchez et al. (2014), we find that there has been a robust correlation between the undulations in the AMOC and the variability in solar irradiance for the last 1,000 years.
Moffa-Sánchez et al., 2014       There were several centennial-scale fluctuations in the climate and oceanography of the North Atlantic region over the past 1,000 years, including a period of relative cooling from about AD 1450 to 1850 known as the Little Ice Age. These variations may be linked to changes in solar irradiance, amplified through feedbacks including the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. … The reconstructed centennial-scale variations in hydrography correlate with variability in total solar irradiance. We find a similar correlation in a simulation of climate over the past 1,000 years. [L]ow solar irradiance promotes the development of frequent and persistent atmospheric blocking events, in which a quasi-stationary high-pressure system in the eastern North Atlantic modifies the flow of the westerly winds. … Our results reveal abrupt multidecadal to centennial shifts in the temperature and salinity of the NAC [North Atlantic Current] waters of ∼3.5 °C and ∼1.2 °C, respectively, during the past millennium. The magnitude of the hydrographic variability is substantial and comparable to that recorded in a lower resolution record spanning the present interglacial from a nearby site, which highlights the similarities in the ocean variability on a diverse range of timescales. The timing of the hydrographic shifts shows a strong correlation with total solar irradiance (TSI) variability. Periods of solar minima (maxima) generally correspond to cold and fresh (warm and salty) conditions in the NAC.
Recently published scientific papers have documented that the Modern Grand Maximum of very high solar activity ended in the early 21st century, and this has, in turn, led to many predictions of global-scale cooling in the coming decades (Abdussamatov, 2016, Torres and Guzmán, 2016, Yndestad and Solheim, 2016, Mörner, 2015, Evans, 2016).   The recently observed trends in the North Atlantic ostensibly support these projections of near-term solar- and AMOC-forced multi-decadal cooling, as they are in phase with the dramatic decline in North Atlantic heat content and surface temperatures since the mid-2000s documented above.   If historical trends repeat, and if the North Atlantic continues to act as a harbinger of what is to come climatically, we may be on the cusp of cold period reminiscent of yet another Little Ice Age – the 19th in the last 7,500 years.
For the sake of humanity and the rest of the biosphere, let’s hope these near-term global cooling projections are inaccurate, as warmth is much preferred to cooling.

"The frozen extremities of the northern hemisphere are melting at a near-record rate as heatwaves buffet the Arctic, forest fires tear through Siberia and glaciers retreat on Greenland fjords and Alpine peaks. Unusually high temperatures are eating into ice sheets that used to be solid throughout the year, according to glaciologists, who warn this is both an amplifying cause and effect of man-made climate disruption across the globe. Greenland – which is home to the world’s second biggest ice sheet – is likely to have shrunk more in the past month than the average for a whole year between 2002 and now, according to provisional estimates from satellite data. Surface ice declined in July by 197 gigatonnes, equivalent to about 80m Olympic swimming pools, according to Ruth Mottram of the Danish Meteorological Institute. An additional third of that amount is likely to have been lost from glaciers and icebergs. The trend is accelerating. Wednesday was by far the biggest single-day melt-off of the year. “This was one of the highest ever and it is possible today [Thursday] will be even bigger because the heatwave is continuing,” said Mottram. With more than a month of the melt season to go, 2019 is already one of the top 10 years for ice loss in Greenland. The extent is thought unlikely to beat the record in 2012, but Luke Trusel, an assistant professor of geography at Penn State university, said the strength of the melt was greater. Temperatures have been 10C or more above normal this week. Even at the summit of the ice sheet – which is 3,200 metres above sea level – there were 10 hours at or above freezing temperatures yesterday, which is extremely rare, he said. More broadly, ice core analysis has shown that the runoff is at levels expected only once every century, possibly even every millennium. “What was highly unusual in the recent past is becoming the new normal. The Arctic is far more sensitive to warming now than even a few decades ago,” Trusel said. The impact on sea level has not yet been calculated, but the high temperatures are likely to accelerate the calving of the giant Petermann glacier, where at least two huge cracks have been identified in recent years. Giant chunks of ice – each several kilometres in length – are expected to collapse into the ocean in the next few years. The Russian government has belatedly declared a state of emergency in four Siberian regions and reportedly sent troops to help extinguish forest fires that have ripped across an area the size of Belgium. This follows record-high temperatures in several locations. Last weekend, Norway registered its joint hottest day ever. More than 20 areas in the north of the country have recently experienced “tropical nights”, with temperatures above 20C from dusk until dawn. In the Canadian Arctic, which is warming two times faster than the global average, locals have suffered record wildfires, and permafrost is melting decades ahead of predictions. Last month, the far northern community of Alert, Nunavut, registered a record-high of 21C, which a local meteorologist said it had never been seen that close to the pole. European mountains have been affected too. Authorities have warned that the slopes below the Matterhorn’s 4,480-metre peak are increasingly prone to avalanches and landslides because the ice-core is warming. High-altitude lakes of meltwater have also been reported in the Mont Blanc mountain range in France. In Switzerland, the threat to alpine glaciers has been so alarming that more regions are using giant fleece blankets to try to insulate the ice from the hot air. Even so, the country’s glaciers lost about 0.8bn tons of snow and ice during the two recent heatwaves, according to glaciologist Matthias Huss. “Absolutely exceptional for a period of only 14 days in total!” Huss said on Twitter. “And the summer is not yet over.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterWind turbines are ugly, litter the landscape, endanger wildlife, generate erratically, destabilize power grids and even cause health problems. They also have a habit of coming apart and self destructing — thus creating a hazard to persons and property.
The Saxony online daily Sächsische Zeitung (SZ) here reports how a wind turbine collapsed near Leisnig just days ago. An investigation revealed how one of three blades failed catastrophically, thus creating a huge imbalance that caused the tower to buckle 15 meters above the ground and led to the structure to come crashing down. The site reports:
Through the force of the impact, the gearbox unit was driven almost 2 meters into the earth.”
The following short video surveys the damage. Note how one blade had totally come apart.

Earlier in December, Germany’s BILD daily reported how in the Mecklenburg Pommeria town of Süderholz a wind turbine tower snapped in half and crashed to the ground. An investigation is now underway. Süderholz mayor Alexander Benkert ordered the other remaining turbines to be thoroughly inspected.
Bild reports the tower simply snapped 25 meters up but that no one was injured.
Collapsing even when not in operation
In neighboring Denmark one wind turbine shows us that turbines can come apart even when they are not operating. Danish vejr.tv2.dk television site here reports how the blade of one turbine simply “tore off” during a recent storm.

Also here the English Manchester Evening News here reports how a recent storm ripped off all three blades from a turbine one afternoon in England, almost killing a man who happened to be taking his dog for a walk.
Mounting opposition to ugly, unreliable wind power projects
The seemingly collapse-prone turbines are likely yet just another reason on a long list why people now resist them. Once welcome and viewed as a source of clean energy, huge protests are now organizing and mobilizing against wind park projects. Germany’s online nordkurier.de here reports how an online survey found only 15% were in favor of installing more turbines in the Uckermark region.
In the Rhine-Main region, the Frankfurter Neue Presse (FNP) reports on how authorities in Darmstadt recently rejected the building of wind turbines on the Taunuskamm mountain, citing “groundwater protection” needs. The local Green Party, of all people, fumed at the rejection.
Sabotage
The resistance to wind energy in Germany has grown to such an extent that some people are now sabotaging them. In Fulda a person, or persons, broke into a tower and destroyed the electrical gear, causing the unit to halt. The wind park operator suspects wind energy opponents.
First the suspect(s) had on two earlier occasions stopped the turbine by simply pressing the emergency STOP button. In the third attempt on December 26 the switchbox was opened and its contents destroyed. The online Fuldaer Zeitung writes at the end of the article:
Indeed the opposition against further wind turbines in the Eiterfeld area was large in the past.”
Wind energy in Germany is no longer welcome.

Share this...FacebookTwitterUnfortunately it has taken a huge disaster in London to wake up the many German politicians who have been self-drugged up on their green ideology for too long. Now they have been forced to face the harsh reality of their green gross negligence. While millions of endangered birds and animals remain threatened by windmills, it appears that the spectacular inferno may have finally gotten through on another front.
The German ruhrkultur.de here writes in an article titled Insulation madness brings home residents in wanton danger:
The Grenfell Tower fire catastrophe in London, with some 80 lives lost, has finally caused the public to become aware of a problem that has been ignored and swept under the carpet for too long: The insulation madness has led in principle and in large part to death in new buildings and renovated buildings.”
In a mad rush to rescue the planet from a dubiously theoretical year 2100 climate Armageddon, Germany over the years has been vigorously supporting the installation of exterior plastic foam insulation on many buildings over the past years. Unfortunately it is turning out that these materials laid on the exterior of buildings is a fire and health hazard.

Policymakers and bureaucrats had been warned, but in their cause of saving the climate and rescuing humanity, the warnings were smugly dismissed. The state would instead take its orders from Potsdam Institute (PIK) Science.

German “death traps”
London, it turns out, is only the tip of green insulation fire hazard ice berg. Recently German authorities were forced to clear out an entire residential block in the western city of Wuppertal due to the inflammable insulation material placed earlier on the building. Frankfurt’s fire chief said that German residential buildings recently insulated in a like manner are not safe, contradicting what politicians, industry groups and insulation experts claimed in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower inferno.
With the millions of homes that have been fitted with the insulation to meet green energy requirements, many residents are in fact residing in “death traps” waiting to spring, ruhrkultur.de writes.
Facade fires “especially dangerous”

The ruhrkultur.de adds that since the exterior “insulation madness” began, firefighters have noted a strong increase in so called facade-fires, which are “especially deadly because they spread extremely rapidly and give residents hardly any time to escape.” It appears that long standing fire codes and regulations against the use of such building materials were not enforced so as not to impair the green national insulation endeavor. Now lives are at risk.
Driven by “climate rescue-campaign”
As mentioned earlier, a number of German experts warned of the high danger posed by the exterior insulation used to make residential buildings more energy efficient. But politicians of all parties and most of the public, ruhrkultur.de writes, were convinced otherwise, due to the “current, incredible massively driven ‘climate-rescue-campaign’ and the supposedly ‘necessary mass insulation measures’.”
The insulation campaign involves plastering large blocks of polystyrol or polyurethane based insulation material on exterior walls (see photo above), which ruhrkultur.de writes is tantamount to storing large amounts of gasoline in your home.
Toxic gases hazard
The inflammability of the material is not the only danger posed by the exterior foam-type insulation, but in many cases it has been treated with possibly toxic fire retardants, such as tetrabrombisphenol A (TBBA), hexabromcyclododecane (HBCD) and a variety of polybromide diphenylethers (PBDEs).
Also the campaign to weatherproof homes has led to a growing occurrence of dangerous, health-threatening black mold forming inside homes.
So what happens now?
Suddenly homeowners find themselves in houses made in a way that threatens them. How shall they be compensated for? Who has to be held accountable?

UPDATE: “Being retired sure is liberating.” – John Bates. Read: https://judithcurry.com/2017/02/04/climate-scientists-versus-climate-data/#more-22794
===================================
According to a just published article by the Online Mail of the UK here, a “high-level whistleblower” has disclosed that America’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) “breached its own rules on scientific integrity” and “duped” world leaders with manipulated global warming data.
The result of the manipulated data was to exaggerate the computed global warming. The aim was to make “the maximum possible impact on world leaders including Barack Obama and David Cameron at the UN climate conference in Paris in 2015,” the Sunday Online Mail writes.
Manipulated data and the breaching of scientific rule have long been an accusation made against the NOAA in the climate science community, especially in the wake of the 2009 leaked Climategate e-mails, which showed scientists colluding to manipulate climate data and to unethically suppress scientific dissent. The ensuing whitewash was equally controversial.
“Irrefutable evidence”
The latest revelation, according to Online Mail, comes from “impeccable” NOAA scientist Dr. John Bates, who has shown “irrefutable evidence” that an NOAA paper showing accelerating global warming was rushed to be published just before the Paris Conference in 2015, and was “based on misleading, ‘unverified’ data“. The paper became to be known as the “Pausebuster” and was central in spurring the 2015 Paris Treaty.
Central African data made up entirely
On another matter, the NOAA has just come under massive fire as climate science skeptic Tony Heller presented at his realclimatescience blog strong evidence that the government agency manipulated December 2016 data in order to make it “red hot” in Central Africa, “with record heat“. However, the problem is that there are no measurement stations whatsoever located in the vast region, and so the NOAA simply made up and filled in the hot data.
Heller notes that full-surface temperature measurement by satellites in fact show that “the NOAA’s record hot regions in Africa were actually close to normal“.

Figure above: The heated data that the NOAA reported to the public.

NOAA data actually recorded by thermometer (Source of above charts: realclimatescience.com.
Heller, a prolific critic of climate science, commented that the NOAA “reported” map (first chart) above “is fake” and that the “NOAA has almost no temperature data from Africa, and none from central Africa. They simply made up the record temperatures.”
Flawed datasets
Concerning the just challenged NOAA’s 2015 ‘Pausebuster’ paper, the Online Mail writes that it is based on “two new temperature sets of data“, both of which were “flawed.” The Online Mail adds that the paper used “unreliable methods which overstated the speed of warming” and that “revised data will show both lower temperatures and a slower rate in the recent warming trend“.
What is worse about the paper is that the data used to produce its results weren’t archived and made available, which violated NOAA rules and proper scientific methodology. The Online Mails adds:
Before he retired last year, he continued to raise the issue internally. Then came the final bombshell. Dr Bates said: ‘I learned that the computer used to process the software had suffered a complete failure.’ The reason for the failure is unknown, but it means the Pausebuster paper can never be replicated or verified by other scientists.“

"The Extinction Rebellion protesters think you should be angry. They want politicians and opinion columnists to be angry. The more people they upset stopping traffic in the Brisbane city centre – the louder the car horns, the more vicious the insults – the more certain it is they’ll be back. “It’s not an enjoyable experience, we don’t take pleasure in doing it,” says Emma Dorge, an activist arrested in Brisbane on Tuesday, during a day of mass civil disobedience that shut down Australia’s third-largest city.  “It is a polarising tactic. But this is an emergency, and we’re out of other options.” Extinction Rebellion, the decentralised global movement calling for aggressive action on the climate crisis, has engaged in similar disruption tactics in major cities on every continent. Those protests have been most effective when they are most polarising, like in Queensland, where talking and writing and screaming and marching about the climate emergency has not shifted public sentiment; a state home to the threatened Great Barrier Reef, and also the world’s most controversial coal project. Seventy-two people were arrested and charged by police during “rebellion day” protests in the heart of Brisbane on Tuesday. They have been stopping commuter traffic in the city for months. As outrage grows, so does the sense that climate change is finally subject of the anger it deserves. Dorge, who works as a midwife and has previously been involved in anti-coal protests, says: “There’s nothing holding our governments accountable now. “But shutting down central business districts of cities, if they can’t function anymore, if our cities are continually shut down and immobilised, that will force action. That’s what we’re building towards. “These disruptions will only increase in frequency and duration. We’re not planning to stop until all of our demands are met.” Clancey Maher was studying to be a nurse, working two jobs, when she headed north from Canberra about two years ago. Since then she has been involved in several anti-coal and climate protests. “We are not kidding ourselves,” Maher says. “We’re not winning every person who gets stopped in a car. It’s necessary to force a reaction because the issue is so urgent. “One of the key tactics is definitely disruption.  “You can ignore a petition, you can ignore a rally. This way it promotes public debate on the issue. If you weren’t already talking about climate change at the very least now you’re talking about the disruptions.” Extinction Rebellion’s global focus lends itself to actions in larger cities; pushing for the sorts of transformative changes that can be enacted by governments and corporations, the powerbrokers who might be caught in the commuter jams. About 1,000 people in have been involved in those various protests in Brisbane, with more than 100 arrested. At the same time, the movement runs in parallel to the work of dozens of coordinated environmental groups – some of which run conventional public campaigns and others engaging in blockades – that target the operations of prominent coal companies and their contractors. Many of the Extinction Rebellion protesters have converged on Brisbane while maintaining links to the direct action movement. A day after the chaotic Extinction Rebellion protests in Brisbane, the group Frontline Action on Coal (Flac) issued a long-awaited “red alert” – a call for activists to head to central Queensland and to join physical efforts to stop Adani’s Carmichael coalmine. Carmichael has become the totem for both climate activists and backers of the coal industry – a new thermal coalmine, potentially opening up a new thermal coal basin, built at a time when the calls for action on climate change have become more desperate. The Adani project is a line in the sand – or a hole in the central Queensland dirt – for many activists and backers of the coal industry. For several years, Flac has maintained a camp at a rural property between Bowen and Collinsville; a potential base for launching protest activities at the Carmichael mine site, along the proposed rail route, or at the Abbot Point coal terminal. Flac expects potentially thousands to head north in response to its call. “We need mass occupancy and mass amounts of people to stop this mine from going ahead,” says Amy, a Flac spokeswoman. “We’ve called the red alert because we now believe that it’s time for everyone to start mobilising and heading to central Queensland. “It’s about getting people to understand that they now need to shift to playing a more active part in stopping [the Carmichael mine]. It’s about getting those people who say they’re against Adani to physically get involved and take part in direct action.” As the company began land-clearing works on Wednesday, two Flac activists temporarily stopped about 17 bulldozers by suspending themselves from poles. They say attempts to stop work at Carmichael will continue and escalate. Sophie, a midwife working in central Queensland, is one of many preparing to take a break from her job to take part in the protests. “I feel like the next few months, the next few years are going to be super critical,” Sophie says. “I really love what I do but I want to ensure the kids I see every day being born are coming into a safe climate future.” As the disruptions in Brisbane become more frequent, the backlash has amped-up in volume and vitriol. In News Corp newspaper the Courier-Mail, protesters have been described variously as “ferals”, “ratbags”, “idiots”, “twerps”, “selfish, conceited, misguided … ideological zealots”, “unemployed thugs” and more. Some commentators have even pined for the days of authoritarian Queensland premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who cracked down on street marches and cut a secret deal with police not to penalise officers who acted to suppress protests. The current Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has been more measured but called for the demonstrations to stop. “When you stop people going to and from their workplace, I don’t think people like that,” Palaszczuk said.  The tactics of police have, during the past few weeks, become noticeably more direct. At first, police resisted making mass arrests when protesters performed a “swarm”, blocking an intersection for up to 10 minutes. On Tuesday a young man was chased from the road by a police officer and tackled by a bystander. He broke his arm. Police have also been accused of abusing their power by using bail conditions to punish protesters and shield corporate interests. Fuelling the anger is the way the state crackdown on environmental protesters compares to its treatment of corporations who break environmental laws. Last month, the Guardian revealed that a thermal coalmine in the Darling Downs region, New Acland, committed a “major” breach of the state’s environmental protection act by drilling 27 illegal bores. The company was fined $3,152. Queensland courts have given activists fines almost 20 times that amount for staging protests. Al Wicks was fined $61,000 earlier this year for blocking coal trains. Others face aggressive civil damages claims launched by corporate interests. “They want us to pay for our damages. The fossil fuel industry will never pay,” Wicks says. “It’s more about silencing activists, it’s deterring activists from doing these actions. At the end of the day the people in this movement know what’s at stake, and for that it’s worth losing our liberty and losing our money as well.” Protesters aged 18 to 73 were arrested in Brisbane on Tuesday. Hannah Doole is one of the younger ones. She finished school in 2017 and has since devoted her time to climate activism. “When you’re stopping traffic, people have to stop and think about what’s happening,” Doole says. “You’re not creating tension out of nothing, but you’re forcing it to the surface. “The backlash, the dehumanising nature of it, I think it shows we’re gaining popularity and we’re gaining momentum and that’s gotten under the skin of the right wing. “I am inspired by the diversity of people who have become involved, people who might be doing very respectable jobs, whether they’re scientists or working for the government. “We’re not some group on the fringes of society. We are society.” *First names only used at the request of those interviewed."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the site of the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) Josef Kowatsch and Stefan Kämpfe look at the frosty spells that typically occur in mid May, the so-called “Ice Saints“, which are widely reported on by the German media each year.

The German DWD national weather service, once a model for meteorology and climate, has over the years taken on a more activist global warming role, with some even claiming that it too has joined the propaganda army of the man-made global warming movement.
Not surprisingly, the DWD management has been claiming in the press that the so-called Eisheilige (Ice Saints) have been getting less intense over the years and that they may wind up disappearing altogether. Because of global warming!
Often typical in mid May, a weather pattern involving a high located over the North Atlantic near Iceland feeds blasts of polar air across Europe. This happened last year on May 14, 2016 – see following chart:


Figure 1: A high over Iceland pumped polar air (blue arrow) across Europe, 2016.
Unfortunately, the DWD has been spreading false information on Europe’s Ice Saints, the two authors at EIKE write, and that their article is to make German readers aware that the DWD top management has been “regularly telling complete falsehoods to the media over the past years in the week before may 11“.
Kowatsch and Kämpfe add.

The DWD Chairman has claimed that over all the previous years:
1) The “Ice saints” recently have been getting continuously warmer and that they will soon become the Hot Saints, which the press then gladly called the Sweating Saints, and
2) the Ice Saints have practically disappeared on account of climate warming.”
These claims of course aroused the suspicions of Kowatsch and Kämpfe, who decided to go back and look at the DWD’s own data. What they found is that the DWD had been misleading the media and the public with statements of warmer Ice Saints periods, and that in fact the very opposite has been occurring: the Ice Saints have been getting colder!
The following charts show the mean May 11-15 temperature for Potsdam, which is home of the notoriously alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), headed by global warming pope, Prof. Dr. Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber.

Figure 1: The Ice Saints (May 11-15) for Potsdam, Germany since 1985 – going back more than 30 years. The mid-May frosty period has in fact been getting colder, not warmer as the DWD has claimed. Chart: Josef Kowatsch
Kowatsch and Kämpfe also present the trend for Dresden-Klotzsche, an official station of the DWD. It too shows a cooling trend. So why would the media be reporting that the “Ice Saints” have been disappearing? Baffling, to say the least.

Figure 2: DWD station Dresden Klotzsche. Blue curve shows the May 11-15 mean temperature with linear trend, 1985 – 2016. Brown shows the maximum high temperatures, gray shows the minimum temperatures and yellow shows the 5 cm surface temperature. Chart: Samuel Hochauf. For 2016 the mean temperature was 12.88°C, i.e. right on trend.
Kowatsch and Kämpfe summarize:

All four trend lines [in Figure 2] show that the Ice Saints have been getting colder since 1985, and not warmer. All four trend lines show that the statements from the DWD management are false. The Ice Saints in Germany are getting colder.
Kowatsch and Kämpfe also look at another DWD weather station, which has been in operation since 1996: Goldbach bei Bischofswerda. Here as well the Ice Saints have been getting steeply colder:

This makes it all the more puzzling that the DWD higher-ups would be using the terms “recently has been“, or “is currently” getting” when telling the public the Mid May frost periods are disappearing. Example here.
Kowatsch and Kämpfe write that this year the DWD spoekespeople should make major changes in the next press releases on the subject of mid May cold spells, suggesting: “The month of May is getting colder and the Ice Saints are getting even colder” and that he should add the remark: “The Ice Saints soon will be as cold as they were in the mid 20th century, some 60 years ago when scientists worried about a new ice age.”
Why are May cold snaps in Europe getting colder?
Kowatsch and Kämpfe suspect that solar activity may be a major factor in the may cooling, as it is known that it has an impact on large weather patterns over Europe. Solar activity has been dwindling over the past 2 decades. Another factor maybe the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which now appears to be coming down from its warm peak. CO2 obviously is having no effect at all.
Josef Kowatsch is an independent nature and climate researcher. Stefan Kämpfe is an agricultural engineer and also an independent nature and climate researcher.
============================
PS: This year it appears that the Ice Saints will be right on schedule, with even winter conditions (snow!) across Scandinavia and Eastern Europe.

Share this...FacebookTwitterPlenty of superlatives have been used to describe President Donald Trump’s speech to the nation on Februrary 28.
Fox News called it “one for the ages” as the newly elected President spoke on a wide range of pressing issues and daunting problems the nation faces, like immigration, drugs, crime, runaway debt, urban decay, economic stagnation, over-regulation, education, terrorism…to name a few.

Not among the pressing issues was “climate change”. Not once did the President bring up the issue, which some on the opposition side have long been calling “the greatest threat to civilization“.
What can we gather from this as the President undertakes to work hard to mobilize and find the scrace resources needed to fix the out of control messes Washington has created over the past couple of decades? Expect the President to (finally) take the chainsaw to government programs promoting the climate hoax.
First place to start is to cut off the money pipeline to the non-problems and to divert it over to the matters that are really pressing, i.e. real problems mentioned above. The President thinks very little of climate change being a problem, and so did not mention it once. Rather, he mentioned coal and growth.
The climate scare and hoax are about to lose their last legs.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA former NOAA meteorologist and 40-year veteran of hurricane predictions believes Irma will continue to move move west toward Florida and reach near the southern tip of the Florida Peninsula around Sunday, September 11th, as a major category 4 hurricane.

Irma eerily similar to Hurricane Donna’s (1960) track. Public Domain image.
Both David Dilley of Global Weather Oscillations and the National Hurricane Center now believe Irma will make landfall near the southern tip of Florida, from near or just west of Miami to just west or near Jacksonville and then run up the coast into eastern Georgia.
Dilley adds: “It all depends on exactly when it makes the turn to the north – just 20 miles makes a big difference. Historical tracks favor a landfall near or south of Miami.”
Predictions based on natural cycles
Dilley had predicted a harsh hurricane season already back in early February, long before most forecasters were ready to go public with their forecasts.
In his February forecast, he predicted that the USA’s record 12-year run without a major hurricane hit would end in a big way.
He also predicted that the southern tip of Florida would be hit by a major hurricane, one that would move northward through the state after making landfall, and that this southern Florida zone overall would enter the strongest and most active hurricane cycle since the period from 1945 to 1950 (65 to 70 years ago).
Dilley wrote in an e-mail that during this 6-year active period, five out of the 6 years had hurricanes, and some years had multiple landfalls, adding:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




There were a total of 8 hurricanes during this 6-year period, and 6 of the 8 hurricanes were major Category 3 to 5 hurricanes.”
So far his predictions for the current season have been impressively accurate. Dilley says he is tracking 4 historical analog years that are like the 2017 season, noting that hurricane patterns have a strong tendency to repeat in cycles.
He reminds us that three of the 6 landfalls from 1945 to 1950 were major hurricanes, with 2 of them being strong Category 4 hurricanes. There were also two category 3 hurricanes – and only one hurricane was a Category 1.
The analog years he used for forecasting the current season go back to 1910.
The bottom line, says Dilley: “This Southern Florida zone has entered the most active and dangerous cycle in 65 to 70 years. About 70% of the hurricanes that strike this zone are major hurricanes.” This year mostly likely will not be any luckier.
No global warming – “all using natural cycles”
On what’s behind the hurricanes, the 40-year veteran does not believe it has anything to do with manmade global warming and higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. According to Dilley: “I nailed it 8 months in advance and the likely Texas hurricane – all using natural cycles of the earth-moon-sun interactions – and No Global Warming.”
While most models predict little danger from now forming José, Dilley wrote that it will develop into a hurricane and that there’s a chance José “could pose a New England threat near the 21st“.

"Multiple lightning strikes have been observed 300 miles from the North Pole, according to the US National Weather Service, in the latest sign of extreme changes to the Arctic environment. The strikes, detected by the NWS station in Fairbanks, Alaska, were produced by towering storm clouds. They were detected on Saturday, and while not unique, come as the region is experiencing record-low sea ice levels, high temperatures and widespread fires on areas of tundra.  An extreme ice-melt in Greenland is estimated to have produced a run off of 197bn tons of ice-sheet water into the Atlantic, enough to raise sea levels by 0.5mm, or 0.02in, in a one-month time frame. On a single day, 1 August, Greenland lost 12.5bn tons of surface ice to the sea. At the same time, a wildfire has been burning in western Greenland while Siberian wildfires have produced smoke haze circling the upper regions of the globe. According to a NWS tweet and statement, the lightning strikes hit an area of sea ice or open ocean waters mixed with ice, near 85 degrees north, 120 degrees east. “This is one of the furthest north lightning strikes in Alaska forecaster memory,” the NWS stated. Fairbanks meteorologist Ryan Metzger told the Washington Post that he could not say if the strikes were unique, partly because meteorologists say they don’t always focus on that area. “I wouldn’t say it’s never happened before, but it’s certainly unusual, and it piqued our attention,” Metzger said. The strikes are the latest sign that Arctic warming is accelerating beyond predictions due to human-caused global climate change. In July, Alaska had its hottest month on record with temperatures breaching 90F in Anchorage, exceeding those in Miami. There is no longer any sea ice present in Alaskan waters, with Bering Sea ice beginning its annual melt in February while the extent of Arctic sea ice is at its lowest in at least 1,500 years, according to research."
"The Morrison government has committed to spend $500m on climate change and disaster resilience in the Pacific. The announcement – on top of an existing commitment of $300m for 2016-2020 – marks a significant shift from the Abbott government, which was criticised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for decreasing the emphasis on climate change in the aid program.  In a statement the Morrison government said the $500m will “be used to invest in renewable energy, ensure new infrastructure can withstand disasters and ensure health services are well positioned to respond to changing needs”. Previous investments have included: ensuring roads and bridges are more resilient to extreme weather in Papua New Guinea so people have access to markets and can visit their families during times of disaster the Tina River Hydropower project to provide power to most of Honiara in the Solomon Islands building climate resilient schools in Kiribati The government has set aside $140m of the $500m for the Australian private sector mobilisation climate fund to encourage private sector investments in low emissions, climate-resilient solutions for the Pacific and south-east Asia. At a press conference on Tuesday, the minister for international development and the Pacific, Alex Hawke, confirmed that the $500m will be drawn from the aid budget which “is staying the same”. Hawke said that “for the first time we’re going to spend more of the budget on climate projects, this is the most that any Australian government has ever spent” on climate change in the aid budget. “The aid budget works in a number of ways, we’ll be reprioritising some of those needs over time. “Much of the funds that we are using through the aid budget is to leverage more private sector investment.” The shadow minister, Pat Conroy, said the $500m “is meaningless without Australia taking real action on climate change”. “This is cynical window dressing that does nothing to address the existential threat Pacific Islands face from climate change,” he said. “Nor is it a new investment – it is money diverted from the already stretched aid budget which has been cut by more than $11bn under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government.” The Greens spokesman, Adam Bandt, said “this $500m isn’t new, it’s a dodgy accounting trick that does nothing more than move money about within our already scandalously small aid budget”. Dfat’s review of the quality of Australia’s climate change assistance – published in July 2018 – found that of the 26 investments worth $642m evaluated, just nine (35%) “are likely to achieve, significant, climate relevant outcomes relative to their size and scope”. “A further nine investments have achieved, or are likely to achieve, some modest, climate-relevant outcomes,” it said. Adaptation measures had benefits including: better use of data for adaptation and risk planning, more integrated planning, legislative and policy changes, community awareness and better tools to manage the risks and plan for climate change effects. The benefits of mitigation were “less evident” but included: encouraging the uptake of solar, wind, hydropower and off-grid energy to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. The evaluation found that reporting of climate change results was often “inadequate and inconsistent … [particularly] where climate change was not the primary objective of the investment”. Dfat blamed in part “a loss of climate-specific expertise from the aid program as funding and priorities changed” after the election of the Abbott government in 2013, including climate change investments being rebranded as food security, water security or disaster preparedness measures."
"The prime minister of Fiji has warned Australia to reduce its coal emissions and do more to combat climate change as regional leaders prepare to gather in Tuvalu ahead of the Pacific Islands Forum this week. Speaking in Tuvalu at a climate change conference ahead of the forum on Monday, Frank Bainimarama appealed directly to Australia to transition away from coal-powered energy and asked its government “to more fully appreciate” the “existential threat” facing Pacific nations.  “I appeal to Australia to do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change,” said Bainimarama, who presided over the UN’s peak climate change body, Conference of the Parties, in 2017. “That transition should be just for your own people and just for us here in the Pacific, where we face an existential threat that you don’t face and challenges we expect your governments and people to more fully appreciate. “Put simply, the case for coal as an energy source cannot continue to be made if every nation is to meet the net zero emission target by 2050 that has been set by the UN secretary general and every other responsible leader of the climate struggle.” Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, was expected to come under serious pressure from other leaders at the forum for the country’s perceived inaction on reducing emissions. Tuvalu, a country of just 11,000 people three hours north of Fiji, is one of the most vulnerable to rising sea levels and could be rendered uninhabitable in the coming century. The prime minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, said he had concerns about Australia’s coal policy, which he had previously expressed to Morrison, and its use of carryover credits as a means of reducing emissions. He said the positive relationship with Australia could change if the future of his people was not taken seriously. “I hope we can be more understanding that the people of Tuvalu and small island countries are already submerged, are already going underwater,” Sopoaga said. “If our friend Australia does not show them any regard, any respect, it is a different thing, we cannot be partner with that thinking. I certainly hope we do not come to that juncture to say we cannot go on talking about partnerships regardless of whether it is [the Australian government’s Pacific] Step-Up or [New Zealand’s Pacific] Reset, while you keep pouring your coal emissions into the atmosphere that is killing my people and drowning my people into the water.” This year will be the first time a Fijian prime minister has attended the summit since Fiji was suspended in 2009 for refusing to call elections. Though Fiji was reinstated into the forum in 2014, Bainimarama has not attended since then, saying in 2010 that he would not attend while Australia and New Zealand were part of the group because they wielded too much influence, telling the ABC: “I don’t think they should be in the forum, they’re not Pacific islanders.” Bainimarama addressed these comments in his speech in Tuvalu, calling Australia and New Zealand “great nations on our perimeter who are part of our organisation”. “My views until now on their place at this forum are well known,” he said to laughter around the room. “But we are in a new era in which both countries are attempting to re-engage with us in a more respectful and inclusive way and I, for one, warmly welcome that.” The prime minister of Tonga, Akilisi Pōhiva, will also attend the conference despite being seriously ill. When he arrived at the airport in Tuvalu on Sunday he was immediately driven away rather than walking through the terminal for the official welcome. Pōhiva told the Guardian on Monday that he was attending because the region was at a crossroads due to climate change. “My physical presence in the meetings is significant to me,” he said. “I’m sure it is mostly likely that this will be my last attendance at a forum so it was very important to me to be here.” Morrison and his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern will not be arriving in Tuvalu until Wednesday, unlike most regional leaders who are already there.

Germany’s renewable energy feed-in tariff is expected to skyrocket another 0.75 euro cents/kilowatt-hour – to 7.1 euro cents. The following chart shows the annual growth of the feed-in tariff in cents per kilowatt-hour since 2000:



Source: Science Skeptical
After rising sharply since 2009, Germany’s so-called EEG feed-in tariff dropped slightly in 2015. This led to renewable energy proponents proclaiming that the sharp rises were over and that consumers could relax and expect a gradual drop. Of course few believed it.
Today Germany joins Denmark in having the highest electricity rates in the world. The EEG feed-in tariffs, which pay for the energy produced by renewable sources such as wind, solar and biogas, are set to rise in 2017 from 6.35 cents per kilowatt-hour to a staggering 7.10 cents, according to Germany’s number daily “Bild”.
In fact reports even say that the tariff could even jump to 7.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, which would be a whopping 15% jump in a single year. The reason of course is the expansion of the volatile renewable energies, which power companies are forced to buy before purchasing from fossil fuel plants.
For a family of three, the rise will mean an additional expense of 35 euros annually. Currently each citizen pays on average 250 euros annually for the feed-in tariff alone, costing Germans a total of 20 billion annually.
For all the money, Germans are only getting pain for it. Not only are thousands of Germans seeing their power get cut-off because they are no longer able to afford it, the power supply and grid have grown more unstable than ever before. South Australia type blackouts now threaten the country. In short: A junk product for a luxury price.

No CO2 reduction in Germany since 2009!
The reason for the massive investments in “green” renewable energies was of course to reduce CO2 emissions. However Krueger also writes that Germany’s CO2 emissions have not dropped at all since 2009. The following chart shows CO2 emissions in millions of tonnes (note in German 1.400 means 1,400 tonnes in English):


Moreover from 2009 to 2016 2009 und 2016, Germany’s installed capacity of renewable energies grew from 48 GW to 102 GW.

However, there’s been no reduction in CO2 emissions.
In summary, Germany’s Energiewende has failed to reduce CO2, and has only succeeded in driving costs to record highs, costing thousands of jobs, making the power grid more unstable than ever, leaving increasing numbers without power and theoretically lowering the global temperature a couple of a hundredths of a degree.
This is nothing less than social violence against the common citizens.

"Attempts to solve the climate crisis by cutting carbon emissions from only cars, factories and power plants are doomed to failure, scientists will warn this week. A leaked draft of a report on climate change and land use, which is now being debated in Geneva by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), states that it will be impossible to keep global temperatures at safe levels unless there is also a transformation in the way the world produces food and manages land.  Humans now exploit 72% of the planet’s ice-free surface to feed, clothe and support Earth’s growing population, the report warns. At the same time, agriculture, forestry and other land use produces almost a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, about half of all emissions of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases, come from cattle and rice fields, while deforestation and the removal of peat lands cause further significant levels of carbon emissions. The impact of intensive agriculture – which has helped the world’s population soar from 1.9 billion a century ago to 7.7 billion – has also increased soil erosion and reduced amounts of organic material in the ground. In future these problems are likely to get worse. “Climate change exacerbates land degradation through increases in rainfall intensity, flooding, drought frequency and severity, heat stress, wind, sea-level rise and wave action,” the report states. It is a bleak analysis of the dangers ahead and comes when rising greenhouse gas emissions have made news after triggering a range of severe meteorological events. These include news that: • Arctic sea-ice coverage reached near record lows for July; • The heatwaves that hit Europe last month were between 1.5C and 3C higher because of climate change; • Global temperatures for July were 1.2C above pre-industrial levels for the month. This last figure is particularly alarming, as the IPCC has warned that rises greater than 1.5C risk triggering climatic destabilisation while those higher than 2C make such events even more likely. “We are now getting very close to some dangerous tipping points in the behaviour of the climate – but as this latest leaked report of the IPCC’s work reveals, it is going to be very difficult to achieve the cuts we need to make to prevent that happening,” said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. The new IPCC report emphasises that land will have to be managed more sustainably so that it releases much less carbon than at present. Peat lands will need to be restored by halting drainage schemes; meat consumption will have to be cut to reduce methane production; while food waste will have to be reduced. Among the measures put forward by the report is the proposal of a major shift towards vegetarian and vegan diets. “The consumption of healthy and sustainable diets, such as those based on coarse grains, pulses and vegetables, and nuts and seeds … presents major opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” the report states. There also needs to be a big change in how land is used, it adds. Policies need to include “improved access to markets, empowering women farmers, expanding access to agricultural services and strengthening land tenure security”, it states. “Early warning systems for weather, crop yields, and seasonal climate events are also critical.” The chances of politicians and scientists achieving these goals are uncertain, however. Nations are scheduled to meet in late 2020, probably in the UK, at a key conference where delegates will plant how to achieve effective zero-carbon emission policies over the next few decades. The US, the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, will have just had its presidential elections. A new Democrat incumbent would likely be sympathetic to moves to control global heating. Re-election of Donald Trump, who has called climate change “a hoax”, would put a very different, far gloomier perspective on hopes of achieving a consensus."
"John Vidal hit the nail on the head by linking Meghan and Harry’s choice to limit their family size for the sake of the climate to the lack of access many women globally have to services that would enable them to make the same choice (Having kids is bad for the planet. So are the royal jets, 1 August). Vidal highlighted that “many in areas of high growth want fewer children but cannot access contraception”, and as CEO of a global organisation providing women and girls with access to family planning, I agree. More than 214 million women and girls worldwide are unable to access contraception. Yet we know that when they have access to contraception and safe abortion, they often choose, like Meghan, to have smaller families. Women are increasingly and disproportionately bearing the burden of the climate crisis. It often falls on women to care for growing families in worsening conditions. Droughts mean limited access to food and water. Rising sea levels lead to floods. Humans and animals are competing for dwindling resources, especially in countries that contribute least to global carbon emissions.  By 2050, populations in low and middle income countries are expected to more than double to 1.7 billion – and offering women real choice in contraception to empower them to determine their futures in the face of the climate crisis is something that can no longer be overlooked. Women want it, the world needs it, and governments must take action to increase access to family planning now.Simon CookeCEO, Marie Stopes International • You write that “Poorer countries, which broadly speaking are the least to blame for the climate crisis – emitting less carbon dioxide per capita – will suffer most” (Editorial, 1 August). As overseas development charities like Cafod witness every day, there is no “will” about it. Poor people in poorer countries have been suffering the effects of climate change for many years. A 2013 DfID-funded paper found: “This analysis provides evidence that a drought in East Africa such as seen in 2011 has become more probable as a result of anthropogenic climate change.” The drought affected 10 million people in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and Uganda. Many of whom would have migrated, some possibly to Europe.David MurrayWallington, Surrey • There is a silver lining to the dark cloud of the insulting and offensive comments made by Andrew Bolt about Greta Thunberg (Thunberg hits back at columnist who mocked her autism, 3 August). The fact that Bolt has resorted to such a personal attack on her means he has no credible arguments against the substance and science of what she is telling the world about the seriousness of climate change. Small comfort for Ms Thunberg perhaps, but telling. Harvey Sanders London • Mark Carney is right to stress the need for urgent action to tackle climate change. However, his assertion that the invisible hand of the market will provide a fix (Report, 31 July) ignores the central role of capitalism in the climate crisis itself: oil spills, land grabs, slash and burn, intensive farming, resource exhaustion, and unhampered economic growth in a physically finite planet. To borrow a phrase from Audre Lorde, “the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house”. We need to square the challenge of climate change with system change.Oliver TaherzadehCambridge • May I suggest that, as a climate emergency now officially exists in the UK, you reposition the regular item on your Weather page entitled “Carbon count”? Currently the information included under this heading – ie the daily atmospheric CO2 readings from Mauna Loa, Hawaii, compared against both a pre-industrial base and what is judged a “safe level” – are tucked away under the heading of “Weather”. Not only is this rather misleading as the information relates to climate, not weather, but in the current emergency I would argue that this is by far and away the most important item of daily news that you report in your paper.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFormer Supervisory Board Chairman of German chemicals giant BASF Jürgen Hambrecht has “sharply criticized” the German government for “deceiving the public and giving them the runaround” when it comes to the Energiewende, reports the online N24/Die Welt here
Hambrecht, considered one of Germany’s most influential executives, gave an interview to N24/Die Welt together with FDP politician Volker Wissing.
German government putting out fake information
The German daily wrote in the photo caption that Hambrecht “is furious about government political information being totally disconnected from reality“.
He describes the German political environment as one that has been hijacked by emotional thinking and fear, with facts being left on the wayside.
The 70-year old executive, who recently joined the FDP Free Democrat Party, told N24/Die Welt that German competitiveness “is acutely at risk” — and what is especially irritating is the massive taxpayer-paid disinformation recently put out by the the Ministry of Economics in a brochure claiming page after page that the country’s Energiewende [transition to renewable energies] was a “success story”.

Energiewende in reality a “huge botch”
Yesterday this blog wrote here how in just one year more than 330,000 German households had their power supply cut-off because electricity had become too expensive, and how German energy-intensive companies — like chemicals — were hurting.
On the brochure put out by Ministry of Economics, Hambrecht commented to N24/Die Welt:
‘Our success story’ is its title. Then there many pages of praise over falling electricity prices and stable supply.”
Hambrecht says the brochure in fact “has little to do with reality” and that the truth is:
The Energiewende is a huge botch. The costs continue to rise and the supply stability will be at extreme risk if we phase out coal and gas after ending nuclear. That annoys me a immensely as the citizens are being deceived and given the runaround.”

"It was a quiet Monday afternoon in the picturesque town hall of Lingolsheim, outside Strasbourg. The school summer holidays had started and it was exceptionally hot. But at 4pm something extraordinary happened. Eleven people calmly walked in, politely greeted the receptionists, then headed to the room usually reserved for council meetings. They carefully unhooked the picture of the French president, Emmanuel Macron – the type of portrait that hangs in all local administration buildings – gently placing it in a special protective pouch, and then walked out.  The climate protesters took the portrait home and waited, wondering when the local gendarmes would knock on their doors. It was the latest act in an unusual and fast growing civil disobedience movement in France in which framed portraits of Macron have been taken down by protesters from more than 100 town halls, stretching from small Beaujolais villages to Normandy towns, from Biarritz to Paris, leading to a police crackdown and court appearances. “The blank space left on the wall symbolises the void in government policy on the climate emergency,” the protesters said in a statement after the latest portrait seizure in Lingolsheim. Climate activists from the association ANV Action non-violente COP21 say the “Take Down Macron” campaign is a “desperate and urgent” move to force France to do more about the climate emergency. Macron presents himself as a world leader in the fight against global heating, and the guarantor of the UN’s 2015 Paris climate accord. He has challenged Donald Trump on the issue, vowing France would “make our planet great again”. However, the nation’s independent advisory council on the climate recently warned of a “gap between ambition and reality” . Its report said France was failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions fast enough, particularly via road transport and buildings, and without major policy change was unlikely to meet its goals. France has a long history of civil disobedience on environmental and social issues, that has included a campaign by the farmer and activist José Bové to rip up GM crops, and a movement stressing that money lost in tax evasion could fund the fight against global heating. The removal of Macron’s portraits, however, has a special symbolism that has captured the public’s interest. French presidential portraits, which stare down on citizens from the walls of schools, town halls and government buildings, are a powerful sign of the republic. The basic portrait in a frame may be worth only a few euros, but as the economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, warned: “You don’t attack symbols of the republic.”  The portrait activists, who have described themselves as normal, “resolutely non-violent” citizens, include public-sector workers, retired teachers, rail workers, students and small business employees. Last week, more than 1,000 people met at a climate camp in north-east France to prepare protest actions. Before taking each portrait of the president the activists carry out reconnaissance trips to the town halls. They do not cover their faces or hide their identities and often wear high-visibility jackets carrying their logo. But in a country preparing for the G7 summit at the end of August and still reeling from the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement, there has been a firm police response. Officers advised by the country’s anti-terrorism force have questioned 89 people and carried out 72 searches of properties. Several activists have gone on trial for “group theft by deceit” since the movement began five months ago. More trials will take place in the autumn in cities including Paris, Lyon, Orléans and Grenoble. The group argues that each time they appear in court, public support grows. “I asked myself what can I do to channel this anger I feel about the lack of real government action on the climate emergency?” said Anne-Sophie Trujillo Gauchez, 46, an activist who works as a consultant and who previously ran international humanitarian missions for big charities. She lives in a Beaujolais village where she recycles goods and uses an electric bike. “But individual gestures like that are not enough without proper structural change in society.” One Saturday morning in March, Trujillo Gauchez and 13 others entered the town hall of Jassans-Riottier and removed Macron’s portrait from a wall adorned with every French leader since Charles de Gaulle. A few days later police appeared at her house with a summons. Trujillo Gauchez was among six activists who stood trial for “group theft by deceit” in the first portrait removal proceedings in May, in the eastern French town of Bourg-en-Bresse, as more than 300 activists stood outside chanting “we’re all portrait removers!” The head judge asked one activist during the trial if he agreed that taking the portrait could be seen as an attack on the authority of the state. He replied: “I would hope the authority of the state isn’t just a portrait hanging in a town hall room used for marriages.” Each activist was convicted and received suspended fines of hundreds of euros, much less than the prison sentences and fines in the thousands of euros available to the court. But the state prosecutor has appealed, so a retrial will be scheduled to take place early next year. Christelle Mercier, a lawyer in the case, said the state’s appeal over the sentences was disproportionate for a protest that was “purely symbolic”. There are more trials to come. Thomas Fourrey, a lawyer preparing a defence in Lyon, said he would argue that the activists took down the portraits out of “necessity” over the climate emergency. Marion Esnault, 30, the national spokesperson for the Take Down Macron campaign, will go on trial in September over two portraits taken from Paris town halls, along with the person who filmed the removal for YouTube. Other observers have been caught up. A journalists’ union complained when local reporters covering a portrait removal in Normandy received police summons, first for taking part in group theft, then as witnesses. Esnault said it was symbolic that the court hosting the trial was also used for terrorist cases. “If France wants to position itself as a world leader on the climate emergency then it must at least respect its objectives,” she said, adding the movement began just as Greenpeace and other organisations moved to take the French state to court to force it to respect environmental commitments. “I think non-violent civil disobedience in France is going to increase as a form of action on this.” Michael Kluger, 30, a biomechanics researcher, is among three activists recently cleared of group theft in Strasbourg after he took down Macron’s portrait in Kolbsheim town hall, near a controversial motorway ringroad project. He said: “This is about opening people’s eyes to the need for change. There has to be an urgent leap in society to overhaul our infrastructure in order to save the environment.”"

And this warming will be unlike anything polar bears have survived before.”  —  Polar Bears International

Image: NoTricksZone
During the Pliocene, or from about 3 to 5 million years ago, subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere (Norway, Iceland, Canada) were up to 10°C warmer than they are now,  and the Arctic region itself was as much as 19°C warmer than now, with sea-ice-free summers and no permafrost.  All this warmth occurred while CO2 concentrations were well below today’s levels.  Polar bears somehow managed to survive in these balmy Arctic and subarctic climates.
Robinson, 2010
“Pollen from three subarctic sites in the Norwegian Sea, northern Iceland and Labrador Sea indicate that mid-Pliocene January temperatures in Norway, Iceland and southeastern Canada were 4 to 10°C warmer than today (Willard 1994). … Evidence of both mixed deciduous/coniferous and coniferous forests places mean July temperatures 10°C warmer than today [in Arctic Canada] (Vincent 1990). In addition, northwestern Alaska air and sea temperatures during peak Pliocene interglacials were considerably warmer than present, by 7 to 8°C, with no permafrost, and absent or severely limited sea ice (Carter et al. 1986; Kaufman and Brigham-Grette 1993).”
From the press release, Robinson states that Arctic summer sea surface temperatures were about 10-18°C (50 – 64°F) on average 4 million years ago, compared to 0°C (and lower) during summers today.
“The U.S. Geological Survey found that summer sea-surface temperatures in the Arctic were between 10 to 18°C (50 to 64°F) during the mid-Pliocene, while current temperatures are around or below 0°C (32°F).”
Ballantyne et al., 2010
“The consensus among these proxies suggests that Arctic temperatures were ∼19 °C warmer during the Pliocene than at present, while atmospheric CO2 concentrations were ∼390 ppmv.”
Cronin and Cronin, 2015
“Pliocene Arctic Ocean summer SSTs were appreciably warmer than modern and seasonally sea-ice free conditions existed in some regions. … At Lake El’gygytgyn (Lake ‘‘E’’) in Siberia summer temperatures were 8°C warmer than modern and at Ellesmere Island, Canada, summer and MAT [mean annual temperatures] were 11.8°C and 18.3°C higher than today.”
“[A] seasonally ice-free marginal and central Arctic Ocean was common … regionally during the early Holocene [6,000 to 10,000 years ago]. … Some species thought to be dependent on summer sea ice (e.g., polar bears) survived through these periods.” 
Arctic Also Much Warmer A Few Thousand Years Ago, With Sea-Ice-Free Summers
Although far less pronounced, the Arctic climate was also much warmer than now (by 2° to 3°C) throughout significant portions of the last 10,000 years, warm enough to elicit sea-ice-free summers (or far less sea ice than exists presently).  Somehow, polar bears survived during these warmer climates.
Spolaor et al., 2016
“We report bromine enrichment in the Northwest Greenland Eemian NEEM ice core since the end of the Eemian interglacial 120,000 years ago, finding the maximum extension of first-year sea ice occurred approximately 9,000 years ago during the Holocene climate optimum, when Greenland temperatures were 2 to 3 °C above present values.”
(press release): “Researchers have found that 8000 years ago the Arctic climate was 2 to 3 degrees warmer than now, and that there was also less summertime Arctic sea ice than today.”
Jakobsson et al., 2010
“The combined sea ice data suggest that the seasonal Arctic sea ice cover was strongly reduced during most of the early Holocene and there appear to have been periods of ice free summers in the central Arctic Ocean.”
Williamson, 1975

“Between 1000 and 1300 average summer temperatures were about 1°C higher than today, with the mean annual temperature higher by perhaps 4°C in a largely ice-free Arctic.”
Jakobsson et al., 2014
“Several studies suggest that the Early Holocene (∼6000–10,000 years BP [before present]) experienced less summer-sea ice than at present. …. [S]ea ice during the Early Holocene potentially could have moved over to a seasonal regime with sea ice-free summers due to the insolation [solar radiation] maxima the Earth experienced at that time.”
Funder et al., 2011
“Arctic Sea Ice extent during the Holocene Thermal Maximum 8,000 years ago was less than half of the record low 2007 level. … Multiyear sea ice reached a minimum between ~8500 and 6000 years ago, when the limit of year-round sea ice at the coast of Greenland was located ~1000 kilometers to the north of its present position.”
Arctic Sea Ice Cover Also Lower Than Now During 18th, 19th, Early 20th Centuries
According to scientists, not only was Arctic sea ice extent much lower than it has been in recent decades a few thousand years ago, it was lower during the 1700s, 1800s, and early 1900s too, when CO2 levels were still quite “safe” at about 300 ppm and less.  In fact, during the 1880s to 1940s period, when Arctic temperatures were warmer than they have been recently, the Arctic’s sea ice cover began forming more than one month later than it has in recent decades (or melted more than one month earlier than it has been) (Durantou et al., 2012).   And somehow polar bears survived these Arctic conditions.
Durantou et al., 2012
“Sea surface temperature [Arctic Ocean, Canada] between ∼ AD 1885–1935 are warmer by up to 3°C with respect to the average modern temperature at the coring site. For the period ∼ AD 1887–1945, reconstructed sea ice cover values are on average 8.3 months per year which is 1.1 months per year lower than the modern values.”

“[T]he series of climatic oscillations affecting the northern hemisphere are linked through a teleconnection sequence between the oceans and the atmosphere called “stadium wave” (Wyatt et al., 2011). This teleconnection plays a crucial role in climatic changes, notably in exchanges of heat fluxes within the Arctic through the Bering Strait (Woodgate et al., 2005). According to our results, the PDO pattern is closely linked with most of the sea-surface condition variability in the study area through upwelling events of Pacific origin.”
According to Zhang and co-authors (2015), sea ice extent in recent decades has followed the patterns of the AMOC and hovered around the average of the last 3500+ years, with many periods (for example, during the mid-1700s) having much lower sea ice extent anomalies than during the last few decades of human influence — or when polar bears have been classified as endangered.
Zhang, 2015
“Observations reveal multidecadal variations in Arctic surface air temperature (SAT), and amplified Arctic warming similar to that observed in recent decades also occurred during 1930–1940. Both observations and climate modeling results suggest that the reduced Arctic sea ice is crucial for the early twentieth century Arctic warming, and internal variability is a very likely cause for that event.”

“The estimated increase in the Atlantic heat transport into the Arctic since 1979 is consistent with the strengthening of AMOC since the mid 1970s implied by indirect evidence such as the AMOC fingerprints, and could have contributed substantially to the observed summer Arctic SIE decline.”
Polar Bears Survived The Arctic’s Warmer Past, And They’re Thriving Now
Somehow, polar bears survived an Arctic climate that was as much as 19°C warmer than now a few million years ago, with balmy (66°F), sea-ice-free summers.
Currently, polar bears are not only surviving, their numbers are growing, leading scientists to conclude that they cannot find support for the perspective that polar bears “are currently in any sort of climate crisis.”
York et al., 2016   
“Subpopulation growth rates and the probability of decline at current harvest levels were determined for 13 subpopulations of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) that are within or shared with Canada based on mark–recapture estimates of population numbers and vital rates, and harvest statistics using population viability analyses (PVA). … Considering both TEK [traditional ecological knowledge] and scientific information, we suggest that the current status of Canadian polar bear subpopulations in 2013 was 12 stable/increasing and one declining (Kane Basin). We do not find support for the perspective that polar bears within or shared with Canada are currently in any sort of climate crisis.”
Because of the tendentious preference to ignore observational and paleoclimate evidence that would not appear to portend their demise, polar bears will continue to be classified as an “endangered” species.  That’s what the concocted narrative of human-caused climate alarm dictates.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate Damaging Palm Oil: Rain Deficit in Amazon Due To Deforestation
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning And Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
[German text translated/edited by P Gosselin]
In a press release on March 13, 2017, the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) presented model results on the impacts of drought on the Amazon rainforest. What follows is the the full text, much of which is correct but mixed with some questionable points:
Vicious circle of drought and forest loss in the Amazon

Logging that happens today and potential future rainfall reductions in the Amazon could push the region into a vicious dieback circle. If dry seasons intensify with human-caused climate change, the risk for self-amplified forest loss would increase even more, an international team of scientists finds. If however there is a great variety of tree species in a forest patch, according to the study this can significantly strengthen the chance of survival. To detect such non-linear behavior, the researchers apply a novel complex network analysis of water fluxes
‘The Amazon rainforest is one of the tipping elements in the Earth system,’ says lead-author Delphine Clara Zemp who conducted the study at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Germany. ‘We already know that on the one hand, reduced rainfall increases the risk of forest dieback, and on the other hand, forest loss can intensify regional droughts. So more droughts can lead to less forest leading to more droughts and so on. Yet the consequences of this feedback between the plants on the ground and the atmosphere above them so far was not clear. Our study provides new insight into this issue, highlighting the risk of self-amplifying forest loss which comes on top of the forest loss directly caused by the rainfall reduction.’ This study results from the  German-Brazilian Research Training Group on Dynamical Phenomena in Complex Networks at (IRTG1740) hosted by Humboldt Universität zu Berlin.
Self-amplifying effect comes on top of the forest loss directly caused by reduced rainfall
Under a dry-season halving of rainfall, at least 10 percent of the forest might be lost due to effects of self-amplification alone, adding to the substantial direct forest losses from reduced water availability. Computer simulations built by the scientists suggest that this has already happened in the Amazon about 20,000 years ago, in accordance with evidence from the Earth’s past. Still, they stress that the uncertainties are considerable. Taking into account the puzzlements of the vegetation-atmosphere-feedback, self-amplified forest dieback could amount up to 38 percent of the Amazon basin. In combination with the direct effects of the droughts, in fact most of the Amazon forest might eventually be at risk.
The study cannot provide information about the time scales of the processes, it is rather a sensitivity analysis.
Strikingly, the huge tropical woods produce much of the water they need themselves by evaporating moisture which then rains back onto them. ‘The Amazon water cycle is of course pure physics and biology, but it is also one of nature’s great wonders,’ says co-author Henrique M.J. Barbosa from the Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. ‘As powerful as the cycle is, it is also surprisingly susceptible to environmental changes – and humankind is imposing massive perturbations on Amazonia by both cutting down the trees and heating up the air with greenhouse gases, which reduces large-scale moisture transport and precipitation, and end up affecting even the untouched patches of the forests.’
Even if average rainfall is stable, extended dry periods increase the risk of tipping

‘Today, the wet season is getting wetter and the dry season drier in Southern and Eastern Amazonia due to changing sea-surface temperatures that influence moisture transport across the tropics,’ says Anja Rammig from Technische Universität München (TUM) and PIK. ‘It is unclear whether this will continue, but recent projections constrained with observations indicate that widespread drying during the dry season is possible in the region.’
Even if average rainfall might not drastically change, extended drought events might tip parts of the Amazon forest into self-amplifying forest loss, eventually turning them into a savanna. ‘Projected rainfall changes for the end of the 21st century will not lead to complete Amazon dieback,’ says co-author Carl Schleussner from Berlin-based scientific think tank Climate Analytics and PIK. ‘But our findings suggest that large parts of it are certainly at risk.’
Interestingly, the more diverse the Amazon vegetation is, the less vulnerable it seems to be.  Diversity has the potential to decrease the effects of self-amplified forest loss. ‘Since every species has a different way of reacting to stress, having a great variety of them can be a means for ecosystem resilience,’ says Marina Hirota from the Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil. ‘Preserving biodiversity may hence not just be about loving trees and weeds and birds and bugs; it may also be a tool to stabilize key elements of the Earth system.’
Article: Delphine Clara Zemp, Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, Henrique M. J. Barbosa, Marina Hirota, Vincent Montade, Gilvan Sampaio, Arie Staal, Lan Wang-Erlandsson, Anja Rammig (2017): Self-amplified Amazon forest loss due to vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks. Nature Communications [DOI:10.1038/NCOMMS14681]”


It is plausible that droughts burden rainforests. On the subject of rain trends, we wish to take a closer look. In the press release we read:
Today, the wet season is getting wetter and the dry season drier in Southern and Eastern Amazon…”
Less rain during the dry period is a problem in the southern and eastern Amazon regions. But what is happening in the west and north? Is rainfall perhaps increasing there during the dry period or remaining steady? The remaining trend statements looks at the future, based on questionable modelling that in the past has seldom been reliable.
An important aspect was brought up only briefly at the start of the article, namely the destruction of rain forests through the supposedly green palm oil barons.
The anthropogenic deforestation under the guise of climate protection, according to one study by Spracklen & Gardcia-Carreras (2015) in the Geophysical Research Letters with respect to a reduction in precipitation:
The impact of Amazonian deforestation on Amazon basin rainfall
We completed a meta-analysis of regional and global climate model simulations (n = 96) of the impact of Amazonian deforestation on Amazon basin rainfall. Across all simulations, mean (±1σ) change in annual mean Amazon basin rainfall was −12 ± 11%. Variability in simulated rainfall was not explained by differences in model resolution or surface parameters. Across all simulations we find a negative linear relationship between rainfall and deforestation extent, although individual studies often simulate a nonlinear response. Using the linear relationship, we estimate that deforestation in 2010 has reduced annual mean rainfall across the Amazon basin by 1.8 ± 0.3%, less than the interannual variability in observed rainfall. This may explain why a reduction in Amazon rainfall has not consistently been observed. We estimate that business-as-usual deforestation (based on deforestation rates prior to 2004) would lead to an 8.1 ± 1.4% reduction in annual mean Amazon basin rainfall by 2050, greater than natural variability.”

"Britain’s biggest companies, investors and pension funds must come clean to investors on the financial risks they face due to the climate crisis, MPs have said. The environmental audit committee (EAC) has called for the City of London to face mandatory climate reporting within the next three years to avoid jeopardising hundreds of billions of pounds worth of pension savings. The cross-party committee of MPs criticised ministers for failing to take specific steps to drive forward climate disclosure plans, despite publicly supporting international recommendations. The MPs urged the government “to clarify in law” that pension funds have a duty to take into account long-term environmental risks to protect their savers. The report comes just weeks after the Treasury outlined plans to force firms and funds to show how the climate emergency could jeopardise their finances. The committee said it did not believe a voluntary approach would be effective and instead called for climate risk reporting to be mandatory on a “comply or explain” basis by the same deadline. The new plans would take effect by 2022 and include financial services firm, too. Mary Creagh, who chairs the committee, said: “Climate change poses financial risks to a range of investments – from food and farming, to infrastructure, construction and insurance liability.” The committee’s report on “greening finance” found that the UK’s financial investment chain was “structurally incentivised” to prioritise short-term profits rather than long-term issues including the climate crisis. “We need to fix the incentives in our financial system that encourage short-term thinking. Long-term sustainability must be factored into financial decision making,” Creagh said. “We want to see mandatory climate risk reporting and a clarification in law that pension trustees have a duty to consider long term sustainability, not just short-term returns.”  The growing calls for mandatory climate reporting come after the government legislated an economy-wide target to reduce carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050. Creagh said the low-carbon transition “also presents exciting opportunities in clean energy, transport and tech that could benefit UK businesses”. “Proper recognition and disclosure of these risks and opportunities would help financial markets work more efficiently and will enable UK institutions and investors to position themselves to benefit from the low-carbon transition,” the report added. The committee also called for pension savers to have a say about how their money is invested by forcing pension funds to actively seek the views of their beneficiaries when they set their investment principles. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, has warned that the global financial system faces an existential threat from climate change and must “raise the bar” to avoid catastrophe. Writing an open letter in the Guardian in April, Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau, the governor of the Banque de France, urged financial regulators around the world to carry out climate change stress tests to spot any risks in the system, and called for a “massive reallocation of capital” to prevent global warming above the 2°C maximum target set by the Paris climate agreement. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said. Insurers already face growing losses from more frequent catastrophic weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods and hurricanes.Banks could suffer from major asset write-offs, as assets could turn out to be worthless if they are reliant on burning fossil fuels. Threadneedle Street has said as much as $20tn (£15.3tn) of assets could be wiped out by climate change if it is not tackled effectively."

The 2017 publication rate (~50 scientific papers per month) is slightly ahead of last year’s pace.  That’s because in 2016 there were 500 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in scholarly journals (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3) challenging the “consensus” claim that weather and climate changes are significantly determined by changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
These 150 new papers support the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in our understanding of climate, and that natural factors — the Sun, multi-decadal oceanic oscillations (NAO, AMO/PDO, ENSO), cloud and aerosol albedo variations  — have exerted a significant or dominant influence on weather and climate changes during both the past and present.

And according to veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi at Weatherbell, more surges of cold and snow are forecast later this week from Pennsylvania to the Smokies, and in California and Colorado, which is forecast to be hammered by a snowstorm. Even Chicago could get snow later in the week.
So winter obviously still has a ways to go and many ski lifts will be operating into Easter, which this year is in mid April.
Dramatic ocean sea surface cooling
Later Joe notes that the ocean sea surface temperature has seen a “dramatic cooling” since last year – especially the Indian Ocean, which may act to feed another El Nino.
Bumper crop – “very little drought area”

The warm Estern Gulf of Mexico will serve to bring more rain over central USA, which Joe says will help lead to a “great growing season” this summer in the United States. Bastardi also says he expects: “very little drought areas this year” and adds: “I think we’re going to see a bumper crop in the Plains in whatever you want to grow“.
Below normal Atlantic hurricane season forecast
On the hurricane season forecasting front, Joe expects a somewhat below normal hurricane season for the Atlantic this year:

Joe Bastardi predicts generally below average hurricane activity for the 2017 season. Along the eastern seaboard, western Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic the forecast is for above normal activity (red area). Chart source: Weatherbell Weekend Summary
Joe’s forecast is different from what veteran meteorologist David Dilley here issued earlier this year. In it Dilley warned it’ll probably be one of the worst in years. But Joe emphasized that this year’s forecast “is tricky” and harbors uncertainty. Yet overall he thinks the season will be more on the gentler side.
US months of February have been cooling
At 9 minutes into the Saturday Summary, Joe debunks claims that the months of February have been getting warmer over the years (a claim that is also often made about Europe, which is false). Joe shows that the recent 10 years (2007 – 2017) in fact “have been getting colder” and were much cooler than the previous 1996 – 2006 years.

"The Greenlandic Perspective Survey tells us that 90% of Greenlanders accept that climate change is happening. More than that, it’s making them anxious and depressed. Given that they live in cultural and climactic conditions that put them at the frontline of ecological change, we might be well advised to take their thoughts and feelings seriously. Where they go, we may very well follow. At opposite ends of the climate spectrum – from the parched landscape of New South Wales to Greenland’s melting sea ice – people are finding the need for new words to describe the mental health issues linked to environmental change. In 2003 the Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht coined the term solastalgia to describe the anguish caused by environmental alterations due to droughts and destructive mining. Taking the Latin word for comfort (sōlācium) and the Greek root designating pain (-algia) he gives us a neologism that sums up the devastating effects of finding unease where you used to look for relief.  If the world around you once promised to be a place that provided a certain amount of food, shelter and consistency, how might you feel as it gradually becomes a place of extreme unpredictability and risk? In Greenland, the north Baffin Inuit have the word uggianaqtuq to describe the unpleasant feeling caused by a friend behaving strangely, or even a sense of homesickness experienced when one is actually at home. More recently, this word has been coopted to describe volatile weather conditions and the sense of one’s surroundings becoming unreliable – storms brew more suddenly and last for longer, the ice is thinner and food is noticeably more scarce. Where you used to be able to sustain yourself by hunting, fishing and foraging, now you may have to supplement this with trips to the newly established supermarket. But how are you supposed to pay for the food? And what if you can no longer afford to feed your dog? Alongside these more specialised-sounding terms we also have the more self-explanatory “ecological grief” and even the idea of a kind of post-traumatic stress linked to the state of the planet. This last idea might sound strange – how can it be post-traumatic when the worst is yet to come? Can you be traumatised by something that’s still happening or even, according to some, might not happen at all? In the 19th century, the French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot linked the apparently nonorganic symptoms of hysteria (a diagnosis he also believed could be applied to men) to the speed of modern life. He believed that previously unprecedented accidents related to industrial machinery and mechanised travel could have traumatising effects. After experiencing, or even nearly experiencing, a technologically related shock you might find yourself unable to process it mentally – it all happened too fast, too hard, too unnaturally to be thinkable. Human minds were simply not equipped to deal with the changes that were taking place in the world around them. Whatever you make of Charcot’s outdated, politically problematic medical categories, his idea of unthinkable transformation surely resonates. For all but the most stalwart climate change deniers something is definitely under way. But how exactly it will manifest itself, and how it will feel, is impossible to predict. Is it really true that we only have 50 more harvests at the current rate of consumption? Might there be advantages for some as well as devastation for others? What impact might a vast reduction of resources have on human behaviour? To many it seems we already have one foot planted in an unbearably dystopian future. How long will it be before political systems collapse and we turn against one another in a frenzy for the last scraps of sustenance? (Or any other imaginable form of mass-inflicted horror?) To others this sort of scenario is delusional, a symptom of media-fed panic. Both “realities” are subject to questioning. Who’s to say who’s madder? In order to experience one’s present reality as anything like a comfortably consistent set of conditions one has to include a calculation around the future. Some people are inclined to catastrophise while others prefer to blot out the possibility of unpleasantness. Both tendencies could be said to be attempts at self-preservation. Should you act pre-emptively to avert disaster, opening yourself up to accusations of being pathologically anxious, or keep calm and carry on at the risk of seeming at best obtuse or at worst selfishly destructive? Is it mad to mourn something before you’ve lost it? This is perhaps a particularly poignant question for a generation of young people currently asking themselves seriously whether or not it’s irresponsible to have babies, many opting not to for fear of what the near future holds in store. In a sense, all responses to the current ecological climate are mad, or at least maddening. Take the threat seriously and risk succumbing to solastalgia, or blot it out and be accused of opting out of reality. In the first case you madden yourself and in the second you madden other people. It can sometimes seem that the only reasonable response is melancholia, anger and helplessness. In the words of Dr Courtney Howard, board president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment: “The intersection between the climate emergency and mental and physical health will become one of the world’s major issues.” For anyone with their ear to the ground, this is obviously already the case. • Anouchka Grose is a psychoanalyst and author"

By Josef Kowatsch and Sebastian Lüning
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
According to the German DWD national weather service August 2016 recorded a mean temperature of 17.7°C. The start of the month was really cool, but the last part of the month the temperature climbed to peak summer levels, and thus compensated for the otherwise sub-par summer. No record temperature was set, with the month’s high some degrees below the record of over 40°C set for a few minutes in 2015.
Using the station network operated by the DWD, which covers all of Germany, and looking over the long term (Figure 1), we can discern four segments since 1931:
1) It was warm during the Nazi times.
2) After the war, mean temperatures dropped, and cool Augusts persisted until 1975.
3) Beginning in 1975 a rapid rise took place until a new temperature high was reached.
4) Since the peak in 2003, the temperatures for the month of August have dropped again. In total the current temperature level is higher than in 1931.

Figure 1: Temperature in Germany for August since 1931. Chart: Kowatsch. Data source: DWD.
To make the trend look more dramatic than it really is, some reporters are using a trick: They like to start the trend at the bottom of a cold period. Many start their chart at 1961 (Figure 2). Clearly this is near the bottom of the 1960s cold period and thus it makes August mean temperatures look as if they are rising rapidly.
August has gotten much warmer over the past 55 years. According to the linear trend line, the mean temperature was near 16°C in 1961, while today we are close to 18°C.

However, Germany’s mean August temperature has stagnated over the past 29 years at a level of 1988. A temperature plateau has been established (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Temperature in Germany for August since 1988. Chart: Kowatsch. Data from DWD.
What’s interesting is a look at the last 20 years (Figure 4). The summer month of August has shown a distinct cooling trend over the past 2 decades.

Thus it’s worth keeping these facts in mind whenever the German media blare out headlines of extreme summer heat. Here it pays to maintain a cool head in order to distinguish between emotions and reality.

"The record-breaking heatwave that roasted Europe last month was a one-in-a-thousand-year event made up to 100 times more likely by human-driven climate change, scientists have calculated. Around the globe, July at least equalled and may have surpassed the hottest month on record, according to data from the World Meteorological Organization. This followed the warmest June on record.  Temperature records were broken in many countries, wildfires continue to devastate vast areas of Siberia, the Greenland ice sheet is melting at a near record rate, and the risk of drought has grown more acute across wide areas of central and eastern Europe. The extreme heat is particularly unusual because it is not an El Niño year – the phenomenon usually associated with prolonged temperature surges. Instead, scientists say it is driven to a large extent by carbon emissions from car exhausts, power plant chimneys, burning forests and other human sources. How much these factors loaded the dice in the two- to three-day heatwave during the last week of July was the subject of an attribution study by a consortium of meteorologists and climatologists at the UK Met Office, Oxford University and other prominent European institutions. It found that the extreme heat in France and the Netherlands, where temperatures peaked above 40C, was made at least 10 times and possibly more than 100 times more likely by climate change. In the UK, which set a record of 38.7C on 25 July, the human impact on the climate made the high temperatures at least two to three times more probable. There was considerable variation from place to place, but in all the studied locations the scientists said it would have been 1.5C to 3C cooler without climate change. Although the recent heat has been described as historic, it is unlikely to remain that way for long, according to the authors of the study. “It will not make history. These records will be broken in few years,” said Friederike Otto, of the University of Oxford. “What we see with European heatwaves is that all the climate models are underestimating the change that we see.” She said further study would investigate how likely it was to have two intense heatwaves in the space of two months. The paper says the extreme heat will have an impact on human wellbeing, though the data on this often lags, which can mean it fails to draw much public attention. “Heatwaves during the height of summer pose a substantial risk to human health and are potentially lethal,” the paper says. “The full impact is known only after a few weeks when the mortality figures have been analysed. Effective heat emergency plans, together with accurate weather forecasts such as those issued before this heatwave, reduce impacts and are becoming even more important in light of the rising risks.” The UN secretary general, António Guterres, who has called a special climate summit of world leaders in September, said the seasons were moving alarmingly far from their usual path. “We have always lived through hot summers, but this is not the summer of our youth. This is not your grandfather’s summer,” he said. “Preventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives, and for our lives. It is a race that we can and must win.” The World Meteorological Organization expects 2015-19 to be the warmest five-year period ever recorded. “July has rewritten climate history, with dozens of new temperature records at local, national and global level,” said the organisation’s secretary general, Petteri Taalas. “Unprecedented wildfires raged in the Arctic for the second consecutive month, devastating once pristine forests which used to absorb carbon dioxide and instead turning them into fiery sources of greenhouse gases. This is not science fiction. It is the reality of climate change. It is happening now and it will worsen in the future without urgent climate action.”"
"The climate crisis is causing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety to people in Greenland who are struggling to reconcile the traumatic impact of global heating with their traditional way of life. The first ever national survey examining the human impact of the climate emergency, revealed in the Guardian on Monday, shows that more than 90% of islanders interviewed fully accept that the climate crisis is happening, with a further 76% claiming to have personally experienced global heating in their daily lives, from coping with dangerous sea ice journeys to having sled dogs euthanised for economic reasons tied to shorter winters.  The Greenlandic Perspectives Survey was carried out by the University of Copenhagen’s Center for Social Data Science, the Kraks Fond Institute for Urban Economic Research and the University of Greenland. The study samples almost 2% of the population, spanning an area almost three times the size of France. An equivalent study in the UK would involve a sample of almost 1 million citizens. Scattered across 17 small towns and approximately 60 villages, all situated on a narrow coastal strip, Greenland’s residents have often been overlooked by data science. The island faces some of the most acute social issues in the world with high levels of alcoholism and historically disproportionate rates of suicide. According to its lead author, Kelton Minor, the survey finally gives Greenland’s most remote and inaccessible communities a voice on the climate crisis. He said: “The Arctic is a bellwether for the unequal impact of global warming on social and economic systems. As countries struggle to limit future risks and overall warming to 1.5C [an increase of 2.7F], many Arctic and Greenlandic residents are already living in regional climates that have changed by more than this, in less than a lifetime. “Therein lies the paradox: while satellites and sensors monitor the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet, chase icebergs and scan sea ice daily, relatively little is known about what the residents of Greenland think about their changing surroundings.” About 80% of the world's largest island is covered in ice. Inuit people first inhabited it by moving from present-day Canada 4,000-5,000 years ago. It was named by Erik the Red when he led a fleet of 25 ships from Iceland to colonise it in 985 AD. Population: 56,000 - 90% of whom live in 16 towns. Size: 836,000 sq miles (2.16m sq km) - roughly the same size as Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium combined. Official language: Greenlandic - closely related to languages spoken by Inuit in Canada and Alaska. National dish: Meat soup called suaasat which normally contains seal, whale, reindeer or seabirds.

According to the data, detailed in a Guardian investigation carried out across Greenland in the last month, the majority of local residents interviewed believe that the climate emergency will harm its people, sled dogs, plants and animals. The revelation contradicts arguments that local people believe climate breakdown will benefit the Arctic and raises concern over a growing mental health crisis around climate in the polar region. Minor said: “We find that a large majority of the Greenlandic population thinks that local sea ice has become more dangerous to travel on in recent years, suggesting that perceptions of growing risk are widespread for this important social, ecological and economic platform used by residents from all regions. Importantly, we find that residents are more likely to feel negative rather than positive sentiment when thinking about climate change, recent changes in sea ice, as well as glacial changes.” The survey is revealed as the Arctic faces potentially record warming levels. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, US, Greenland has already lost more than 250bn tonnes from a combination of melt runoff and low total snowfall in July. For mental health professionals who specialise in the polar region, the latest survey findings from Greenland will present another red flag for the Arctic’s vulnerable Inuit communities. According to Courtney Howard, the board president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, who lives and works in the Arctic, the intersection between the climate emergency and mental and physical health will become one of the world’s major issues. Howard said: “Temperature change is magnified in circumpolar regions. There is no question Arctic people are now showing symptoms of anxiety, ‘ecological grief’ and even post-traumatic stress related to the effects of climate change. “We are challenging the medical profession to acknowledge the world we are inheriting. Schools and universities aren’t considering how climate change will affect people, from a medical or a psychological perspective, so we are not training a new generation of medical professionals to help people in a fast-changing planet and this is intolerable. We are moving too slowly on this.”"
"One minute we’re suffering from a summer drought; the next minute an intense storm rolls in and a month’s worth of rain falls in a day. As our world becomes warmer the chances of climate extremes, such as droughts and floods, become greater.  We can’t control the weather, but we can manage the water. A technique known as managed aquifer recharge, where flood water is captured and injected into aquifers, is already helping the US state of Texas ride out the worst of its weather extremes.  Gentle drizzle is good at recharging aquifers, but heavy rain tends to run across the surface and ultimately ends up back in the sea. Managed aquifer storage diverts and captures some of that flood water, by storing it temporarily at the surface and then injecting it gradually into depleted underlying aquifers. More than 1,000 such schemes already exist worldwide and now a study in Texas (which has three managed aquifer storage schemes) has demonstrated the potential of this technique.  Weather and river data from the past 50 years suggest that if flood-capture systems were installed on the 10 major rivers discharging into the Gulf of Mexico, Texas could replenish much of its depleted groundwater in just a few years."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s online Der Spiegel here reports that Germany once again will fail to reduce its CO2 emissions this year, 2017.
This is a profound embarrassment for Germany, a country that has been a staunch preacher of climate protection and one of the world’s most vocal critics of President Donald Trump’s decision to back out of the Paris Climate Accord.
Rise of 5 million tonnes
According to the leftist Spiegel, greenhouse gas emissions in Germany rose by 5 million CO2 equivalent tonnes in the first half of 2017, hitting 428 million tonnes. That’s a jump of 1.2%. Experts say that the rise is likely due to increased petroleum consumption. According to Spiegel, diesel fuel sales are up 6.5 percent.
Part of the increased petroleum probably is due to low fuel prices, and the unusually colder than normal weather in January and April. Germany is failing horribly to reach its emissions targets, as the following chart shows:

German equivalent Co2 emissions fell from 1,251 million tonnes in 1990 to 906 million tonnes in 2016. However, there has not been reductions in 8 years. Source: UBA
And if this year’s trend keeps up, it’ll mean that Germany’s emissions will have remained flat for 9 consecutive years. A decade of failure. It will also mean that the country’s greenhouse gas emissions will rise for a third consecutive year. More here.
Germany’s anti-diesel movement will end up raising CO2 emissions
The bad news for the climate-protection-preaching Germany is that greenhouse gas emissions reductions are likely going to get far tougher, as once again the country’s leaders are managing to shoot themselves in the foot in the comedy that has become the Energiewende.
One of the country’s leading Green Party politicians, Winfried Kretschmann, has just warned that the current movement to ban the diesel engine will have serious climate target consequences, reports the online Die Welt. As the publicity against the diesel engine cranks up, people will opt for the gasoline-powered cars instead. The problem here is that diesel engines get far better fuel mileage than the Otto engines, and so German consumers will only end up spewing more CO2 in the atmosphere.
Also Germany’s flood of immigrants, who have other worries on their minds, will add to make the German targets an even bigger fairy tale.

"Scott Morrison will unveil a $500m climate change and oceans funding package for the Pacific region when he attends the Pacific Islands Forum leaders meeting in Tuvalu this week. The funding package, which will use existing aid funds to help Pacific nations invest in renewable energy and climate and disaster resilience, will build on the $300m given by the government for that purpose in 2016-2020.  “The Pacific is our home, which we share as a family of nations. We’re here to work with our Pacific partners to confront the potential challenges they face in the years ahead,” said the prime minister. The government also announced it had set aside $140m from the aid budget to encourage private sector investments in low-emission, climate-resilient projects for the Pacific and south-east Asia. Morrison will face strong pressure from other Pacific leaders when he arrives in Tuvalu on Wednesday, many of whom have already issued warnings that they want commitments from Australia at this forum for concrete action to reduce emissions and to move away from coal-fired power. On Monday, during a one-day climate conference hosted by the Tuvalu government, the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, a global leader in the fight against climate change, issued a direct appeal to Australia to move away from coal-powered energy and asked its government “to more fully appreciate” the “existential threat” facing Pacific nations. “Put simply, the case for coal as an energy source cannot continue to be made if every nation is to meet the net zero emission target by 2050 that has been set by the UN secretary general and every other responsible leader of the climate struggle,” said Bainimarama, who is a former president of the UN’s leading climate body COP (Conference of the Parties). The forum is being hosted in Tuvalu, a country of 11,000 people located three hours north of Fiji, which is at serious risk from rising sea levels as a result of climate change. Climate change is at the heart of this year’s forum, from the moment leaders arrive at Funafuti airport and are greeted by the children of Tuvalu, who sit submerged in water, in a moat built around the model of an island, singing: “Save Tuvalu, save the world.” Speaking to Guardian Australia ahead of the forum, the prime minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, said he had concerns about Australia’s coal policy and its use of carryover credits as a means of reducing emissions. He said the positive relationship with Australia could change if the future of his people was not taken seriously. “I hope we can be more understanding that the people of Tuvalu and small island countries are already submerged, are already going underwater,” Sopoaga said. “If our friend Australia does not show them any regard, any respect, it is a different thing, we cannot be partner with that thinking. I certainly hope we do not come to that juncture to say we cannot go on talking about partnerships regardless of whether it is [the Australian government’s Pacific] Step-Up or [New Zealand’s Pacific] Reset, while you keep pouring your coal emissions into the atmosphere that is killing my people and drowning my people into the water.” Simon Bradshaw, Oxfam Australia’s climate advocacy lead who is in Tuvalu for the forum, said that while this money would be welcomed by Pacific leaders, it would not mean the Australian government was off the hook when it came to reducing emissions. “Australia couldn’t come here empty-handed, they were going to have to bring something, but a new commitment of climate finance ... that’s not enough,” said Bradshaw. “It’s one part of the equation, it’s an important part, but really it carries no meaning if it’s not accompanied by new strong commitments from Australia to drive down its emissions, its carbon pollution, to move beyond coal, to play its part in limiting warming to one and a half degrees, which we’ve heard repeatedly is crucial to survival in the region.” Bradshaw said that Pacific leaders had never been as strident in their calls for urgent action to reduce emissions and preserve their homes and islands as they have been in the lead-up to this forum. “They’re absolutely clear that Australia’s rising emissions, our coal exports are threatening their very survival,” he said. “From all the talk we’ve heard this week, whereas this commitment will be welcomed, it’s certainly not going to quieten the concerns of Pacific leaders who have been very clear that they want Australia to look beyond coal, to move to 100% renewable energy and to really appreciate the sorts of challenges they face here.” Claire Anterea, co-founder of the Kiribati Climate Action Network, an advocacy group based in Kiribati, which like Tuvalu, is one of the small island states most at risk due to rising sea levels, said: “Our situation in Kiribati and in the Pacific, it’s not about cash, it’s not about giving lots of money, if Australia doesn’t do actions within their own country,” she said. “Australia needs to do more, not just give money to solve the problem. Money is not the solution for the impacts of climate change. Our Kiribati government is working toward adaptation, but my worry is how long are we going to adapt? Adapt forever? I don’t think that is a possible solution for us, there will be a time when adaptation is not going to work.”"
"It may not be widely known, but the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has always been headed by a European, and the World Bank by a US citizen. This is the unwritten convention, or gentlemen’s agreement, that has held since these twin global financial institutions were established in the aftermath of the second world war. Yet those with an interest in how, and for whom, the global economy is run have long been deeply unhappy about this cosy arrangement. And these concerns have once again been brought into sharp focus after Christine Lagarde, the IMF managing director, announced she is stepping down next month.  An all-European shortlist was once again drawn up by the EU. But the European establishment has struggled to agree on who it wants to fill the role ahead of a 6 September deadline for nominations, with the Bulgarian Kristalina Georgieva chosen to be the EU’s nominee after a divisive round of voting on Friday. “The truth is that there is no readily available tried-and-tested European all-rounder,” a European minister told CNBC. Surely, with a final decision on Lagarde’s successor expected on 4 October, now is the moment for such regressive and anti-democratic leadership conventions to be scrapped. In April I chaired a discussion inside the World Bank in New York among 200 civil society leaders, and explicitly questioned the World Bank’s executive directors, arguing that it was “unbelievable that the recruitment and appointment to the [leadership of the] bank came from one single nation”. This governance issue is about so much more than mere cosmetics. As the world becomes ever-more politically polarised and vulnerable to populist leadership, and as the US administration turns away from multilateralism and takes a sceptical approach on the climate crisis, there is all the more reason for these major institutions – which are so keen to boast of their globalist credentials – to take an inclusive, merit-based approach to what ought to be a diversified recruitment process. The coming window for new leadership is an opportunity for the IMF to demonstrate a different model that is democratic and – crucially – inclusive of candidates from the global south. It simply cannot be right that the leadership of the institutions with the greatest power to tackle the climate crisis excludes applicants from those countries where that crisis is wiping out the lives and livelihoods of many millions of people. The IMF aims to create sustainable growth and to reduce poverty in the world. How can it do so when it is run on fundamentally undemocratic principles? It is time for all members of the IMF to stand together and vote against a model that mocks the principles and values that the same countries place above all else. The hypocrisy and double standards are damaging world peace and development progress. It is time to see leaders who have the courage and boldness to evidence the values they champion. The most vulnerable people in our communities are paying a huge price for weak leadership that serves the interest of the few in the name of the rest. And this is not just a question of figureheads. It goes to the heart of inherent deficiencies with these institutions. The growth-focused narratives at the IMF and the World Bank are simply not working for the world’s poorest and most marginalised. Instead they drive ever greater destruction of the natural systems on which we all rely, and ever greater global concentration of wealth and power. What is desperately needed are ways of reorganising the economy around principles of sustainability to keep within our boundaries of a single shared planet, and create democratically owned economic systems that will meet the needs of everyone, without giving way to the greed of the very few. Gentlemen’s agreements have no place in a world of diverse economies, communities, peoples, races and nations. They are not fit for purpose in a global institution of 189 countries, working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. The IMF, like the World Bank, needs to modernise, or it is in danger of outliving its usefulness to the world. Now must be the time to act. We need global institutions that are fit for where we are going and not for where we have come from. Let us safeguard the future with the right values and actions. • Amanda Khozi Mukwashi is chief executive of Christian Aid"

A Human Influence On Precipitation
 ‘Has Yet To Be Detected’

“Climate model output suggests decreasing rainfall as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas radiative forcing.”
“[I]f anthropogenic forcing has impacted the [regional rainfall pattern], the signal has yet to be detected above the level of natural climate variability.” – Lachniet et al., 2017

According to climate models, precipitation trends were supposed to have intensified as a consequence of human activity.
And yet after compiling decades of observational and proxy (paleoclimate) evidence, it has been determined there has been no detectable global-scale human influence on rainfall patterns in the last hundred years (even hundreds of years).  Instead, any variability in the hydrological cycle can be strongly linked to non-anthropogenic forcing mechanisms, namely solar activity and natural oceanic/atmospheric oscillations (NAO, PDO, AMO, ENSO).

Miralles et al., 2013
The hydrological cycle is expected to intensify in response to global warming. Yet, little unequivocal evidence of such an acceleration has been found on a global scale. This holds in particular for terrestrial evaporation, the crucial return flow of water from land to atmosphere. Here we use satellite observations to reveal that continental evaporation has increased in northern latitudes, at rates consistent with expectations derived from temperature trends. However, at the global scale, the dynamics of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) have dominated the multi-decadal variability. 

Modern Precipitation Trends Similar To Past Centuries

Verdon-Kidd et al., 2017
Overall, the inter-annual and inter-decadal variability of rainfall and runoff observed in the modern record (Coefficient of Variation (CV) of 22% for rainfall, 42% for runoff) is similar to the variability experienced over the last 500 years (CV of 21% for rainfall and 36% for runoff). However, the modern period is wetter on average than the pre-instrumental (13% higher for rainfall and 23% higher for runoff). Figure 9 also shows that the reconstructions contain a number of individual years (both wet and dry) of greater magnitude than what has been recorded in the instrumental record.


Kostyakova et al., 2017
A nested July–June precipitation reconstruction for the period AD 1777–2012 was developed from multi-century tree-ring records of Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) for the Republic of Khakassia in Siberia, Russia. … The longest reconstructed dry period, defined as consecutive years with less than 25th percentile of observed July–June precipitation, was 3 years (1861–1863). There was no significant difference in the number dry and wet periods during the 236 years of the reconstructed precipitation.


Shi et al., 2017
Five of the six coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project Phase III (PMIP3), can reproduce the south-north dipole mode of precipitation in eastern China, and its likely link with ENSO. However, there is mismatch in terms of their time development. This is consistent with an important role of the internal variability in the precipitation field changes over the past 500 years.


Conroy et al., 2017
20th century precipitation variability in southern Tibet falls within the range of natural variability in the last 4100 yr, and does not show a clear trend of increasing precipitation as projected by models. Instead, it appears that poorly understood multidecadal to centennial internal modes of monsoon variability remained influential throughout the last 4100 yr. … Until we have a predictive understanding of multidecade to multi-century variability in the Asian monsoon system, it would be wise to consider the risk of prolonged periods of anomalously dry and wet monsoon conditions to be substantial (Ault et al., 2014). Such variability may also explain why the predicted anthropogenic increase in Asian monsoon precipitation is not widely observed.

Clarke et al., 2017
Corresponding ~4-8 year periodicities identified from Wavelet analysis of particle size data from Pescadero Marsh in Central Coast California and rainfall data from San Francisco reflect established ENSO periodicity, as further evidenced in the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), and thus confirms an important ENSO control on both precipitation and barrier regime variability.


McCabe et al., 2017
In this study, a monthly water-balance model is used to simulate monthly runoff for 2109 hydrologic units (HUs) in the conterminous United States (CONUS) for water-years 1901 through 2014. … Results indicated that … the variability of precipitation appears to have been the principal climatic factor determining drought, and for most of the CONUS [conterminous US], drought frequency appears to have decreased during the 1901 through 2014 period.

Lachniet et al., 2017
[M]onsoon dynamics appear to be linked to low-frequency variability in the ENSO and NAO, suggesting that ocean-atmosphere processes in the tropical oceans drive rainfall in Mesoamerica. … Climate model output suggests decreasing rainfall as a consequence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas radiative forcing (Rauscher et al., 2008; Saenz-Romero et al., 2010). Our data show, however, that the response of the monsoon will be strongly modulated by the changes in ENSO and the NAO mean states … Our data also show that the magnitude of Mesoamerican monsoon variability over the modern era when the anthropogenic radiative forcing has dominated over solar and volcanic forcings (Schmidt et al., 2012) is within the natural bounds of rainfall variations over the past 2250 years. This observation suggests that if anthropogenic forcing has impacted the Mesoamerican monsoon, the signal has yet to be detected above the level of natural climate variability, and the monsoon response to direct radiative forcing and indirect ocean-atmosphere forcings may yet to be fully realized.

Past, Modern Precipitation Patterns Modulated By Solar Forcing

Lei et al., 2017
The precipitation variability on decadal to multi-centurial generally always reflects changes in solar activity and large-scale circulation, e.g., the ENSO and the EASM [East Asian Summer Monsoon] (Chen et al., 2011; Vleeschouwer et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2014). [D]uring the MWP [Medieval Warm Period], the wetter climate in this region was consistent with more frequent ENSO events, stronger EASM and higher solar activity, whereas the opposite was found for the LIA. In particular, d13Cac fluctuations on multi-decadal to centennial scales is consistent with the changes in solar activity, with fewer dry intervals corresponding to periods of minimum solar activity within dating errors, which are referred to as the Oort Minimum (AD 1010-1050), Wolf Minimum (AD 1280-1340), Sporer Minimum (AD 1420-1530), Maunder Minimum (AD 1645-1715) and Dalton Minimum (AD 1795-1820).


Warrier et al., 2017
Climatic periodicities recorded in lake sediment magnetic susceptibility data: Further evidence for solar forcing on Indian summer monsoon … The results obtained from this study show that solar variations are the main controlling factor of the southwest monsoon.

Zhang et al., 2017
The frequencies represent the influence of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and solar activity on the precipitation from the southwestern United States. In addition, solar activity has exerted a greater effect than PDO on the precipitation in the southwestern United States over the past 120 years. By comparing the trend of droughts with the two fundamental frequencies, we find that both the droughts in the 1900s and in the 21st century were affected by the PDO and solar activity, whereas the droughts from the 1950s to the 1970s were mainly affected by solar activity.

Munz et al., 2017
Decadal resolution record of Oman upwelling indicates solar forcing of the Indian summer monsoon (9–6 ka) … We use geochemical parameters, transfer functions of planktic foraminiferal assemblages and Mg /  Ca palaeothermometry, and find evidence corroborating previous studies showing that upwelling intensity varies significantly in coherence with solar sunspot cycles. The dominant  ∼  80–90-year Gleissberg cycle apparently also affected bottom-water oxygen conditions.

Zhai, 2017
The time series of sunspot number and the precipitation in the north-central China (108° ∼ 115° E, 33° ∼ 41° N) over the past 500 years (1470–2002) are investigated, through periodicity analysis, cross wavelet transform and ensemble empirical mode decomposition analysis. The results are as follows: the solar activity periods are determined in the precipitation time series of weak statistical significance, but are found in decomposed components of the series with statistically significance; the Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is determined to significantly exist in the time series, and its action on precipitation is opposite to the solar activity; the sun is inferred to act on precipitation in two ways, with one lagging the other by half of the solar activity period.

Sun et al., 2017
[A]t least six centennial droughts occurred at about 7300, 6300, 5500, 3400, 2500 and 500 cal yr BP. Our findings are generally consistent with other records from the ISM [Indian Summer Monsoon]  region, and suggest that the monsoon intensity is primarily controlled by solar irradiance on a centennial time scale.

Zhu et al., 2017
Abrupt enhancements in the flux of pedogenic magnetite in the stalagmite agree well with the timing of known regional paleofloods and with equatorial El Niño−Southern Oscillation (ENSO) patterns, documenting the occurrence of ENSO-related storms in the Holocene. Spectral power analyses reveal that the storms occur on a significant 500-y cycle, coincident with periodic solar activity and ENSO variance, showing that reinforced (subdued) storms in central China correspond to reduced (increased) solar activity and amplified (damped) ENSO. Thus, the magnetic minerals in speleothem HS4 preserve a record of the cyclic storms controlled by the coupled atmosphere−oceanic circulation driven by solar activity.

Zielhofer et al., 2017
Western Mediterranean Holocene record of abrupt hydro-climatic changes … Imprints of North Atlantic meltwater discharges, NAO and solar forcing …Early Holocene winter rain minima are in phase with cooling events and millennial-scale meltwater discharges in the sub-polar North Atlantic. … [A] significant hydro-climatic shift at the end of the African Humid Period (∼5 ka) indicates a change in climate forcing mechanisms. The Late Holocene climate variability in the Middle Atlas features a multi-centennial-scale NAO-type pattern, with Atlantic cooling and Western Mediterranean winter rain maxima generally associated with solar minima.

Matveev et al., 2017
An increase in atmospheric moisture for the warm period of the year (May–September) since 1890s, and mean annual temperatures since the 1950s was identified. During the same time period, there was a marked increase in amplitude of the annual variations for temperature and precipitation. … These fluctuations [atmospheric moisture, mean annual temperatures] are consistent with 10–12-years Schwabe–Wolf, 22-years Hale, and the 32–36-years Bruckner Solar Cycles. There was an additional relationship found between high-frequency (short-period) climate fluctuations, lasting for about three years, and 70–90-years fluctuations of the moisture regime in the study region corresponding to longer cycles.

Luthardt and Rößler
The 11 yr solar cycle, also known as Schwabe cycle, represents the smallest-scaled solar cyclicity and is traced back to sunspot activity (Douglass, 1928; Lean, 2000), which has a measurable effect on the Earth’s climate, as indicated by the Maunder minimum (Usoskin et al., 2015). Global climate feedback reactions to solar irradiance variations caused by sunspots are complex and hypothesized to be triggered by (1) variation in total energy input (Cubasch and Voss, 2000), (2) the influence of ultraviolet light intensity variation on composition of the stratosphere (Lean and Rind, 2001), (3) the effect of cosmic rays on cloud formation (Marsh and Svensmark, 2000; Sun and Bradley, 2002), and/or (4) the effect of high-energy particles on the strato- and mesosphere (Jackman et al., 2005). …  [L]ike today, sunspot activity caused fluctuations of cosmic radiation input to the atmosphere, affecting cloud formation and annual rates of precipitation.

Park, 2017
[S]olar activity drove Holocene variations in both East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

Shi et al., 2017
Our results imply that the synchronous change in the Asian–Australian monsoon may be caused by inherent solar variations, further strengthening previous findings.

Past, Modern Precipitation Patterns Modulated By AMO/PDO/NAO/ENSO

Macdonald and Sangster, 2017
Statistically significant relationships between the British flood index, the Atlantic Meridional Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index are identified. The use of historical records identifies that the largest floods often transcend single catchments affecting regions and that the current flood-rich period is not unprecedented. … Solar forcing can manifest itself in a variety of different ways on flood patterns through modification of the climate (Benito et al., 2004). Several series indicated increased flood frequency during the late eighteenth century corresponding to the Dalton Minimum (AD 1790–1830), with notable flooding across catchments in the 8-year period AD 1769 1779, which was a climatic period considered to include the sharpest phases of temperature variability during the “Little Ice Age” (Lamb, 1995; Wanner et al., 2008).

Malik et al., 2017
[W]e investigate the impact of internal climate variability and external climate forcings on ISMR on decadal to multi-decadal timescales over the past 400 years. The results show that AMO, PDO, and Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) play a considerable role in controlling the wet and dry decades of ISMR [Indian summer monsoon rainfall]. Resembling observational findings most of the dry decades of ISMR occur during a negative phase of AMO and a simultaneous positive phase of PDO.

Valdés-Pineda et al., 2017
This study analyzes these low-frequency patterns of precipitation in Chile (>30 years), and their relationship to global Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs), with special focus on associations with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) indices. … We conclude that a significant multi-decadal precipitation cycle between 40 and 60 years is evident at the rain gauges located in the subtropical and extratropical regions of Chile. This low-frequency variability seems to be largely linked to PDO and AMO modulation.

Reischelmann et al., 2017
We document that long-term patterns in temperature and precipitation are recorded in dripwater patterns of Bunker Cave and that these are linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO).

Lapointe et al., 2017
This paper investigates an annually-laminated (varved) record from the western Canadian Arctic and finds that the varves are negatively correlated with both the instrumental Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) during the past century and also with reconstructed PDO over the past 700 years, suggesting drier Arctic conditions during high-PDO phases, and vice versa. These results are in agreement with known regional teleconnections, whereby the PDO is negatively and positively correlated with summer precipitation and mean sea level pressure respectively.

Lim et al., 2017
Our study demonstrated that flood frequency and climate changes at centennial-to-millennial time scales in South Korea have been coupled mainly with ENSO activity, suggesting that the hydrologic changes, including flooding and drought, in East Asia are coupled to the centennial-to-millennial-scale atmospheric-oceanic circulation changes represented by the ENSO pattern.

Reynolds et al., 2017
Evidence derived from instrumental observations suggest that Atlantic variability, associated with changes in SSTs and fluctuations in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), is directly linked with broader scale climate variability, including Brazilian and Sahel precipitation (Folland et al., 1986 and Folland et al., 2001), Atlantic hurricanes and storm tracks (Goldenberg et al., 2001 and Emanuel, 2005), and North American and European temperatures (Sutton and Hodson, 2005, Knight et al., 2006 and Mann et al., 2009).

Park et al., 2017
According to our results, the central Mexican climate has been predominantly controlled by the combined influence of the 20-year Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the 70-year Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO).

Bianchette et al., 2017
Seven periods of increased water level, varying in duration, occurred during the backbarrier period, with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) likely the main climatic mechanism causing these periodic shifts in the paleo-precipitation levels. We suggest that the deepest water levels detected over the last ~3200 years correlate with periods of increased ENSO activity.

"For her summer holiday this year, Anna Hughes, 36, is cycling from London to Nice, stopping in Paris, Nevers, Lyon, and Provence along the 700-mile route. To return, she’s jumping on the TGV in Nice, arriving back in London around nine hours later. Hughes is one of the trailblazers for flight-free holidays, avoiding gas-guzzling planes for the past decade, and is now director of Flight Free UK, a campaign group encouraging people to take a no-fly year in 2020. “I don’t fly because it’s about the worst thing an individual can do for the environment,” says Hughes. “Even if you take other steps to be environmentally friendly, like recycling everything, using green energy, or even becoming vegan, one flight can wipe out all your savings. A flight is pretty much the most carbon-heavy thing you can buy.”  According to recent Guardian analysis, a long-haul flight produces more carbon emissions than the average person in dozens of countries around the world generates in a whole year. Travelling by train or ferry is significantly kinder to the environment: for instance, the Eurostar from London to Paris produces 4.1kg CO2 per passenger per person compared to 63.6kg by flying, according to the high-speed rail service. In the face of a climate emergency, increasing numbers of people are chosing to ditch planes. While there are legitimate concerns about the additional time and cost, travelling by train to some parts of Europe can end up being a similar price to flying (and minus the headache of hanging around at the airport). Take Hughes’s rail journey from Nice to London, which cost £102. The cheapest one-way flights we could find for an August weekend were £140, although they drop to between £60 and £80 in September. On a return trip from London to Dublin earlier this year, Hughes travelled on a one-way Rail & Sail train and ferry ticket that cost her £50. Looking at prices for next week, Guardian Money found that leaving London at midday and arriving at Dublin Ferry port at 7pm costs around £43.50 for departures scheduled during next week. The cheapest equivalent flights to Dublin are selling at about £45 one way, without the typical £10 to £20 cost to get to the airport. “I live in London and that’s an easy transport hub, but given the extra costs of airport transfers, going to Dublin by train was cheaper than flying. People think flying is cheaper, but it isn’t always,” says Hughes. While flights at off-peak times are generally cheaper than trains, it is often the case that travelling at peak holiday times is cheaper by train. There’s also the added benefit of saving on expensive airport transfers. A peak and off-peak express train from Heathrow to Paddington costs £25 each way, while a return is £37. A single standard ticket from Liverpool Street station to Stansted is £18.90; a standard return is £29.90. However, London is, of course, a much easier transport hub than most other parts of the UK, meaning people living outside the capital would have to consider the price of train tickets if travelling on Eurostar. However, no matter where we’re located in the UK, most fliers are burdened by the extra fees. Ryanair charges £25 to £35 to check in a 20kg bag on a one-way flight. When Guardian Money looked to book an EasyJet return flight from London Gatwick to Madrid for August, the original price came in at £54.79, but eventually rose to £93.77 when including a £19.49 fee for 23kg of baggage each way. And that’s not all. Want to choose where you’ll sit on an EasyJet flight? That’ll be £8.49, thank you. For their summer holiday this year, Abigail Thomas, 37, producer and co-presenter of The Hopeful Activists’ Podcast, and her husband and three children aged eight, six and four, are travelling by train to Switzerland. They say it will cost a little more, but they are having a very different experience. “Our children are becoming passionate about the environment through their school so it seemed a natural step,” says Thomas, who lives in Bradford. She outlines the cost implications: “We’re using an Interrail pass for our train travel on the continent, which will cost €575 (£515) as you get two children free on each pass. Our Eurostar tickets, discounted by the pass, are an additional £265.” The family also plans to make pit-stops in Brussels and Basel. “We could have had a package holiday cheaper if we were flying, but doing it this way we have a much more interesting holiday.” Mark Smith, founder of the train ticketing information site Seat61.com, believes taking the train to parts of Europe is on the verge of becoming mainstream. “This is a grass-roots movement – it’s not coming from the travel industry, which is set up to book flights, car hire and more flights and would rather people flew. “Nor is it coming from the rail industry, which needs to work together more to facilitate this if they want to benefit fully in terms of easy booking systems, and passenger rights when delays mean a missed connection.” Despite the lack of coordination, he says travelling by train can be affordable. “They have their cheap fares if you book in advance at the right website. For example, you can travel from London to Paris from £58 return, Paris to Venice from €29, or London to Berlin from £69.90.” There are also plenty of offers at Rail & Sail, which combines train and ferry travel in one ticket. StenaLine offers ferry and rail trips such as Harwich in Essex to any Dutch station from £49 one-way for an adult and £24.50 for a child. Guardian Money found a Manchester Victoria to Dublin Ferryport ticket, taking five hours 53 minutes door to door, for £39.50. Alexandra Jellicoe, 41, who lives in Bath and is an environmental scientist and blogger at Monkey Wrench, is one of the 2,000 people to have so far signed up to the Flight Free UK campaign. She admits she was a frequent flier up until April this year when she started feeling uncomfortable about the amount of air miles she was racking up. “I was aware that climate change was a big problem, and I was doing my best at home to lead an eco-conscious lifestyle. But I have always lived abroad and travelled extensively for work and leisure, so flying was a fixed part of my routine. “We’d got stuck in a routine of hopping on a cheap flight from Bristol and limited ourselves to places we could access from there.” This summer the family of five – husband Matt and three children aged seven and under – will take the train to Annecy in France, in a trip costing £1,171 and booked through train booking platform Loco2. Jellicoe says a return flight from Bristol to Geneva at the same time, plus connections to the airport at each end, would have cost £1,154. “When you start to think about carbon emissions as part of your decision-making process, you start to travel in different ways – where can I get to by train and which routes are easiest and cheapest. “It’s a different set of limitations but equally exciting. Rather than a weekend, or a week here or there, we’ll plan to go for two to four weeks. And if we only have a short time we’ll holiday closer to home.” Jasmine Salter, 27, based between London and Scotland, used to fly three to four times a year but has radically changed since listening to an Extinction Rebellion talk in November last year. “I haven’t flown since,” says Salter, who volunteers full-time for Extinction Rebellion. Instead she’s choosing the bus and hitchhiking. Recent trips include a 24-hour bus to Geneva at about £40 with an overnight stop at a hostel in Paris for £17. “The difference is how long it takes which makes enjoying the journey part of the adventure,” says Salter. “There has to be a change in the way we value things.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterAfter days of uncertainty, Hurricane Matthew finally took a track taking it directly to Florida. It’s the first major category hurricane to hit the sunshine state (and the US, if I’m not mistaken) in almost 11 years.
The last major hurricane to strike was Wilma in 2005. This 4000-day hiatus is a record since hurricane statistics began to be recorded in the 19th century. This all flies in the face of claims made by global warming believers and alarmists, who crystal-balled hurricane activity would become more frequent and ferocious over time. Yet, globally there has been no trend in global cyclone activity.
The reality is that Matthew will be the first major hurricane to hit that millions of children 12 years old and under can remember. And already no child on the planet under 18 years of age has seen any real global warming at all. Climate scientists could not have been more wrong.
Many more hurricanes when CO2 was low!
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi at Weatherbell reminds us that hurricane activity was far worse in Florida some 70 years ago, in the 1940s, back when atmospheric CO2 concentrations were down near the 310 ppm level:

6 major hurricanes in 7 years with CO2 at 310 ppm!
Count them! Six major hurricanes in only 7 years. Imagine the hysteria if that were to happen during the present time. Instead we are getting the first one in over 10 years – an unusual period of calm.

Clearly this tells us that there’s a heck of a lot more to it than just a trace gas. Of course ocean and solar cycles are the major climate factors.
Everyone’s prepared – except for Trump!
The table is already being set for the upcoming Presidential debate. And I’m ready to bet my last dollar that Trump is going to fall in the trap and make a terrible impression like he did in the first debate. The trap this time: climate change and Hurricane Matthew.
Hollywood megastar Leonardo DiCaprio has already launched it by declaring that anyone who denies climate change is unfit for public office. Hurricane Matthew is now slamming into Florida, and Hillary Clinton is already blaming it on man. The timing just before the debate couldn’t be better. The debate is already rigged: It is going to feature climate change prominently, and Hillary is being prepared well for it. They are going to make Trump look like an uninformed fool – if he allows it.
Trump can avoid this:
1. He has to acknowledge that climate is always changing.
2. Man, however, is playing only a small role.
3. 97% consensus is phony – the science is hotly disputed.
4. Already 750 published papers since 2014 dismissing catastrophic AGW.
5. Temperature trend is far below what scientists projected in 2000.
6. Fact: NASA’s Gavin Schmidt has been altering the historic data.
7. Hurricanes are less frequent today then they were 50, 60 years ago.
He should then ask Hillary directly: Can you honestly promise less storms and nice weather in exchange for more regulation and taxes? If so, then she’s a weather charlatan.
It should take Trump about 60 seconds to say this. But, expect him to come in unprepared and to babble a bunch a nonsense and look bad.
In this debate I expect to see Trump fumble in his own end-zone. You just watch.

"Three women were killed last week while sunning on a beach in Encinitas, California, when the bluff above them gave way. The sudden tragedy that befell Anne Clave; her mother, Julie Davis; and her aunt Elizabeth Cox, who had gathered at the resplendent coastline in the seaside community north of San Diego to celebrate Cox surviving cancer, made headlines around the world. But cliff erosion continues to imperil people and property around the state. California is falling into the sea piece by piece, and coastal conditions will only grow more dire with worsening climate crisis.  A woman was killed in Santa Cruz county when a cliff collapsed beneath her feet in 2017. A landslide on a San Francisco beach killed another beachgoer in 2019. Nearly three-quarters of California’s coastlines are actively eroding, putting lives, homes, roadways, railways, utilities and other infrastructure in danger. The cliffs have been crumbling since before the Arctic began melting, but natural geological collapse stands to worsen in the coming years. “We’re always striving to make our beaches safer – safety is a huge part of beach access,” said Jennifer Savage, California policy manager for the Surfrider Foundation, which is dedicated to coastal preservation. “We did not take everything into account when we started building, so now we’re trying to play catch up, and that’s really hard. But the cost in human lives and to the economy will be profound if we don’t start thinking differently.” Although researchers can’t point to a single cause of any particular cliff failure now, they expect to see more as the climate continues to collapse. “What we can say unequivocally is as sea level rises, these kinds of events will become more common,” said USGS research geologist Patrick Barnard. Scientists say sea level rise will accelerate cliff retreat, doubling average erosion rates in southern California by 2100, including some of the state’s most heavily populated, tony coastal communities. That’s because sea level rise and more extreme storms mean bigger, higher waves washing away beaches and lapping at the bottoms of the cliffs. California stands to lose two-thirds of its beaches by the turn of the next century, in a wave of coastal economic destruction worse than the state’s most devastating fires to date. “We expect the higher the sea level, the more the ocean is pounding the base of the cliff, the more frequently we can expect to have failures like the one in Encinitas,” said Barnard. Coastal residential development, too, contributes to erosion by adding weight to clifftops and changing water drainage routes. And sea walls meant to fortify bluffs and protect communities can actually help scour away protective sand beaches even faster. The stakes are rising along with the ocean. Apartment buildings and homes in Pacifica, south of San Francisco, were condemned and demolished after rapid erosion following an intense 2015-2016 storm season crept under property lines. Several homes in Sonoma, north of San Francisco, have been torn down or have fallen with the cliffs that had once supported them. Sections of California’s famed coastline-hugging Highway 1 have been closed or moved inland, and there are plans to shift more. One potential adaptation strategy is “managed retreat”, or the unbuilding of communities threatened by erosion and flooding along the coast using buyouts and eminent domain. “As time moves forward, we have less and less options,” Sara Aminzadeh, a commissioner with the California coastal commission, told representatives of several cities at a July meeting. “I think it’s incumbent on all of us together to change the narrative and make the case for why [managed retreat] is necessary.” The commission oversees how cities develop and protect their coastlines and has been working to prepare the coast for sea level rise for several years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, several coastal towns are defiant about nature’s inexorable push and instead hope to hold the line by better engineering the natural coastline to withstand more pressure from the Pacific, replenishing sand on the thinning beaches and further armoring cliffs against collapse. The precarious coastal community of Del Mar, for example, just a few miles south of Encinitas, has largely rejected the notion of moving back from the edge, even as its cliffs are crumbling at a rapid clip. Del Mar’s plan to protect the city, where the average home is valued at $2.5m, largely hinges on building up the beach with imported sand – not unbuilding parts of the town that hang in the balance. More of the coastline is bound to fall in the meantime, endangering beachgoers and homeowners alike. The deadly incident at Encinitas is a reminder of how much is at stake. “Just culturally we tend to want to stand our ground as Americans,” said Savage. “The idea of retreat is not who we feel that we are.”"
"Britain needs an overarching new sustainability law to bolster natural life-support systems and prevent economic and social collapse, according to proposals from one of the country’s most influential leftwing thinktanks. The paper says policymakers have made a “catastrophic mistake” by underestimating the risks posed by environmental breakdown and the potential benefits of switching to a different economic approach that focuses on building abundance rather than running down resources.  “A new model is needed to rapidly create societies that are more sustainable, just and prepared: bringing human activity to within environmentally sustainable limits while narrowing inequality, improving quality of life, and becoming better prepared for the accelerating consequences of environmental breakdown,” says the discussion document by the Institute for Public Policy Research. The paper is a follow-up to a widely circulated IPPR study, published in February, that said a gathering storm of human-caused threats to climate, nature and economy posed a danger of systemic crash comparable to the 2008 financial crisis. To avoid this, the document says there is an urgent need for parliament to pass a “Sustainable Economy Act” that would mandate statutory targets to rapidly reduce the effects of declining soil fertility, air quality, pollinator numbers, fish stocks, wildlife diversity and other benchmarks of a healthy environment. The move would effectively place a full sustainability constraint on all UK economic activity, allowing natural abundance to recover for the common good instead of running it down to the detriment of all but a super-wealthy minority. The model would be the Climate Change Act 2008, which put Britain at the forefront of efforts to ensure economic activity was aligned with goals to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that cause global heating. A sustainable economy legislation would go further by widening the range of targets and standards, including those relating to trade to ensure that imported goods were not only safe for human consumption in the UK, but also had a minimum environmental impact in the country of production. This would represent a major change from the current situation in which the UK is making some progress in reducing domestic emissions even as it continues to subsidise and support fossil fuel industries overseas. It would also be markedly more ambitious than the government’s plans for a new Environment Act because the IPPR – which is considered an influence on Labour policy – also proposes establishing a committee to regularly update goals in line with advances in scientific knowledge and creating a powerful watchdog body that would enforce the targets. Environmental groups worry that the government is planning a weak post-Brexit replacement for the EU’s strong monitoring regulations on water quality, wildlife and air pollution. The IPPR said a sustainability act would also require measures to reduce excessive consumption, which was worsening inequality and making it harder to improve living standards. This could include changes to advertising standards, wider introduction of carbon pricing and investment in public services that encourage more sustainable, fulfilling lifestyles. It would also encourage financial markets to include environment risks in asset valuations so that unsustainable investments become prohibitively expensive. Central banks would be asked to take a more prominent role in managing the financial risks from extreme weather and other symptoms of environmental breakdown. A new public investment bank and a network of regional development banks could fund the transition to a carbon-free economy, which would create jobs similar to the plans outlined in the “green new deals” that have been called for in the US and elsewhere. The authors of the IPPR paper say much of this will already be necessary as a result of the UK’s recent commitment to go carbon neutral by 2050. But their proposal would go further to ensure other natural life support systems are not sacrificed in the race to salvage the climate. “We are suggesting placing a boundary on our economy to ensure we live within our environmental means,” said Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report. “It is not just about the climate. Environmental breakdown might be the most complex, dangerous, difficult problem that we’ve ever faced. By its very nature, it requires ambitious, large-scale legislation.” He acknowledges that the current trend in global politics is in the opposite direction, towards a nationalist race to run-down what is left of the world’s resources, but remains optimistic about the positive potential of a new sustainability law, particularly compared to the alternative. “For those who want to listen to suggestions for solutions, this is roadmap,” Laybourn-Langton says. “And we think that a country doing this can unlock great benefits for society in terms of health, quality of life and a sense of a shared abundance … The actions needed to realise this will be hard, but what will be harder will be for my generation and those below me to try to live with the current set of cascading problems. Running down what we have leads to a horrendous, suicidal, self defeating spiral. A good life is where we benefit from a strong commons and not destroy those common resources.”"
" Big miner BHP is again reviewing its membership of the Minerals Council of Australia lobby group following disagreements over environmental policy. Last month, BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie described global heating as indisputable and called for drastic action in response, including but not limited to carbon pricing.  The Minerals Council moderated some of its policies after BHP announced a 12-month review of its membership in December 2017 but the Guardian understands that, despite the changes, and the resignation of its then CEO, Brendan Pearson, senior BHP executives believe the council needs to do more. BHP pulled out of the World Coal Association last year but decided to remain a Minerals Council member after objecting to its advocacy on energy policy, including calling for government support for new coal-fired power plants in Australia. The council is trying to hold its members together amid divisions over climate and energy policy. Its members include multinationals BHP and Rio Tinto, which provide the lion’s share of its funding, and smaller specialist miners less concerned about attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Rio also put pressure on the council last year over its anti-climate policy advocacy but it is understood the company is no longer considering pulling out. BHP’s climate pledge, announced by Mackenzie in a speech in London a fortnight ago, includes a promise to spend US$400m (about $590m) to develop technologies to reduce emissions from its own operations and the “scope 3” emissions that result downstream from the companies that buy its resources. It says it will limit its 2022 pollution at 2017 levels and have net-zero emissions by 2050. Mackenzie said the company would strengthen the link between emissions performance and executive pay from 2021. The Minerals Council chair, former Liberal government minister Helen Coonan, told the Guardian she did not know if BHP was reviewing its membership of the body. “The vice-chair of the MCA is Mike Henry from BHP. We’ve had many conversations about challenges right across the spectrum in the sector but I’ve not had any conversations of the kind that you allude to,” she said. She said there had been tensions with the company in the past over issues including the use of money from another industry body, Coal21 – which shares some directors with the council – on advertisements extolling the virtues of coal. “But I have a very clear understanding that some of those tensions, if not all of them, have been resolved, at least for the time being, and none of them have been raised with me,” Coonan said. The former MP called on the industry to stick with the council and not splinter into separate lobby groups. “A united voice is a much more effective way to deal with government, to deal with regulators, to deal with interest groups, than if you had a fragmented voice.” The council’s emphasis has shifted under Pearson’s replacement, Tania Constable, to saying that coal has a strong future as part of a “technology neutral” approach. Pearson is now an adviser to the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Constable welcomed Mackenzie’s speech, saying it was in line with the Minerals Council’s support of the Paris climate agreement. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal referenced in the Paris agreement, would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. Coonan said the council believed there was a place for “competing technologies”, listing renewables with storage, coal, gas, carbon capture and storage and “possibly even nuclear energy”.  “We don’t see that we’re completely out of step with BHP and we don’t see that we’re out of step with the coal interests either, because of our technology neutral approach,” she said. Climate groups said there was a clear divide between BHP’s goals and the Minerals Council’s public advocacy. The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a shareholder activist group, said the council had recently called for investment in new coal-fired power plants, and had run more than 40 pro-coal advertisements on Facebook and campaigned for the approval of the Adani Carmichael mine. Dan Gocher, the centre’s director of climate and environment, said these steps were “completely inconsistent” with BHP’s position. Matt Rose, an economist with the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the council was taking a destructive approach on public policy and called on BHP to withdraw its membership. “BHP cannot keep walking both sides of the street, talking up climate action on one hand and funding the minerals council to trash it on the other,” he said. The director of policy with the Investor Group on Climate Change, Erwin Jackson, declined to comment on the BHP case, but said institutional investors were increasingly interested in whether industry associations were supporting or undermining climate action. He said critics had tried to dismiss concerns from institutional investors as the work of a few activists. In reality, he said, hundreds of investors controlling trillions of dollars were working with companies to minimise risks associated with climate change. “To try to portray investors as activists demonstrates a failure to understand that climate change is a core financial risk for investors and a systemic risk to the financial system and the economy,” he said."

20-30 Times Slower Than The Past


Currently, sea levels are “believed to be” rising at a rate of 1.7-1.8 millimeters/year.

This modern rate  –  just 0.17-0.18 of a meter per century – has remained relatively unchanged from the overall 20th century average, and there has been no statistically significant acceleration in the sea level rise rate (just 0.0042 mm/yr-²) since 1900.
Wenzel and Schröter, 2014     “Global mean sea level change since 1900 is found to be 1.77 ± 0.38 mm year on average. … [T]he acceleration found for the global mean, +0.0042 ± 0.0092 mm year-², is not significant“
In a new paper just published in the journal Climate of the Past, 7 scientists detail the long-term context for the modern rates of sea level rise.  Between 16,500 years ago and 8,200 years ago, the average rate of global sea level rise was 1.2 meters per century (12 mm/yr), which is about 700% faster than the rate achieved during the last 115 years. … Included in that rate average is the “meltwater pulse” epoch around 14,500 years ago, when sea levels rose at rates of 4 meters per century (40 mm/yr).
Cronin et al., 2017     “Rates and patterns of global sea level rise (SLR) following the last glacial maximum (LGM) are known from radiometric ages on coral reefs from Barbados, Tahiti, New Guinea, and the Indian Ocean, as well as sediment records from the Sunda Shelf and elsewhere. … Lambeck et al. (2014) estimate mean global rates during the main deglaciation phase of 16.5 to 8.2 kiloannum (ka) [16,500 to 8,200 years ago] at 12 mm yr−1 [+1.2 meters per century] with more rapid SLR [sea level rise] rates (∼ 40 mm yr−1) [+4 meters per century] during meltwater pulse 1A ∼ 14.5–14.0 ka [14,500 to 14,000 years ago].”
Other scientists recently suggested that hemispheric-scale sea levels rose by 12 to 22 meters in just 340 years 14,500 years ago, which is 3.5 to 6.5 meters per century.  This explosive sea level rise coincided with a Northern Hemisphere-wide warming event of 4 to 5 °C within a span of a few decades, but it did not coincide with a change in CO2 levels.
Ivanovic et al., 2017    “During the Last Glacial Maximum 26–19 thousand years ago (ka), a vast ice sheet stretched over North America (Clark et al., 2009). In subsequent millennia, as climate warmed and this ice sheet decayed, large volumes of meltwater flooded to the oceans (Tarasov and Peltier, 2006; Wickert, 2016). This period, known as the “last deglaciation,” included episodes of abrupt climate change, such as the Bølling warming [~14.7–14.5 ka], when Northern Hemisphere temperatures increased by 4–5°C in just a few decades (Lea et al., 2003; Buizert et al., 2014), coinciding with a 12–22 m sea level rise in less than 340 years [3.5 to 6.5 meters to per century] (Meltwater Pulse 1a (MWP1a)) (Deschamps et al., 2012).”

J.F. Donoghue (2011) puts the historical magnitude of the “more than 20 times that of today” sea level rise rates into perspective.  Shorelines would have necessarily retreated by as much as 40 meters per year – 75 centimeters per week – during those centuries of obscene sea level rise.
Furthermore, Donoghue specifies that during the last 20,000 years, the overall average sea level rise has been 6 mm/yr, which is more than 3 times the rate of the last century.   In other words, modern rates of sea level rise have significantly decelerated compared to the overall long-term trend.
Donoghue, 2011     “For much of the period since the last glacial maximum (LGM), 20,000 years ago, the region has seen rates of sea level rise far in excess of those experienced during the period represented by long-term tide gauges. The regional tide gauge record reveals that sea level has been rising at about 2 mm/year for the past century, while the average rate of rise since the LGM has been 6 mm/year, with some periods of abrupt rise exceeding 40 mm/year [4 meters per century].”
“Sea level has at times risen at rates more than 20 times that of today, more than 40 mm/year. At such rates, the regional shorelines would have retreated by as much as 40 m/year, or more than 75 cm/week.”
UK geologist Dominic Hodgson and colleagues have determined that sea levels rose at rates of 1.2 to 4.8 meters per century near East Antarctica about 10,000 years ago, when sea levels were 8 meters higher than they are now.
Hodgson et al., 2016     Rapid early Holocene sea-level rise in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica … The field data show rapid increases in rates of relative sea level rise of 12–48 mm/yr between 10,473 (or 9678) and 9411 cal yr BP in the Vestfold Hills and of 8.8 mm/yr between 8882 and 8563 cal yr BP in the Larsemann Hills. … The geological data imply a regional RSL [relative sea level] high stand of c. 8 m [above present levels], which persisted between 9411 cal yr BP and 7564 cal yr BP, and was followed by a period when deglacial sea-level rise was almost exactly cancelled out by local rebound.
And Zecchin et al. (2015) have suggested that “episodic” and “rapid” sea  level rises could reach 6 meters per century (60 mm/yr) for hundreds of years at a time.   That’s about 35 times the current rate.
Zecchin et al., 2015     “The evidence presented here confirms drowned shorelines documented elsewhere at similar water depths and shows that melt-water pulses have punctuated the post-glacial relative sea-level rise with rates up to 60 mm/yr. [6 meters per century] for a few centuries.”
In sum, there has been nothing unusual about the modern rates of sea level rise over the last century.
Actually, sea levels are currently rising at less than a third of the average rate (6 mm/yr) of the last 20,000 years (Donogue, 2011).
The continuance of this long-term deceleration during an era of allegedly significant anthropogenic climate influence strongly suggests that abrupt sea level rise (and fall) occurs independently of the variations in the atmospheric CO2 concentration.

"Half the new cars sold in Australia in 2035 will be electric vehicles even if there is no policy support to drive change, a new government analysis forecasts. It will reinforce the expert view that Labor’s election pledge to set a target of 50% new car sales being electric by 2030 would not have been that significant a shift from a path the country is already on.  Labor’s commitment prompted the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to accuse the opposition of wanting to “end the weekend” by forcing people out of four-wheel drives and the minister for small business, Michaelia Cash, to tell tradies only the Coalition would “save their utes”. The government has said it will introduce a national electric vehicle strategy to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 10m tonnes by 2030, but is yet to release details. A report published by the government’s Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economies examines the uptake of electric vehicles in 22 countries. It found sales vary between nations but are expected to grow rapidly across the world in coming decades. Modelling suggests the electric vehicle share of new car sales in Australia will rise from about 0.34% today to 8% in 2025. It is predicted to then leap to 27% of new car sales in 2030 and 50% in 2035 as prices of electric car technology fall. Behyad Jafari, chief executive of industry group the Electric Vehicle Council, said the report showed the transition to electric vehicles would happen “no matter what” and Australia would not need to do much to accelerate a local industry. “As this report shows, the destination for Australia is predetermined. The choice is how much value and benefit we capture in getting there,” he said. “Globally, there is some $US300bn being invested in the EV sector. Surely Australia should be getting a piece of the action.” The report says battery cost is expected to more than halve by 2025 and continue to decline, but battery size and vehicle range would both increase to more than double by mid next decade before peaking. “This means that the outlook is for a fairly constant battery price for EVs out to 2025, before the price starts to decline,” the report says. It says a similar trajectory is expected for other manufacturing related costs. The infrastructure and transport department said the report set out what would be expected under existing policy settings and did not assume any additional government support, but noted some government agencies invested in electric vehicle infrastructure. A department spokeswoman said electric car uptake in Australia was slow compared with some of the countries examined. She said there would be a rapid change in new car sales once the technology became price competitive, but it would take some time for that to be fully reflected on Australian roads. “There is usually a 10 to 15-year lag between new vehicle sales numbers and overall fleet numbers, so EVs are not expected to be a significant part of the passenger vehicle fleet until well into the 2030s,” the spokeswoman said. The latest report is separate to government modelling discussed in Senate estimates in April. Environment department officials said they also had data prepared by consulting firm Energeia that suggested electric cars would account for 25-50% of new sales by 2030. The government has committed $400,000 to develop its national electric vehicle strategy. It is expected next year. It considered introducing the same vehicle emission standard proposed by Labor, requiring light cars to emit an average 105 grams of CO2 per kilometre, and received advice it would result in a net economic benefit, but decided against introducing the policy. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg last year compared the expected trajectory of EVs to that of the iPhone. He said changes in battery technology and recharging infrastructure were gaining momentum in Europe, Asia and North America and would inevitably be replicated in Australia, and predicted people who mocked EVs would one day be driving them."

"July’s record-breaking temperatures brought summertime smog to most of the UK. Worst affected was eastern England, from Kent to Yorkshire, where air pollution reached seven on the government’s10-point scale. The heatwave occurred just before the 100th birthday of the scientist James Lovelock. Best known for his Gaia theory, which hypothesises that life on Earth acts as a self-regulating system, Lovelock was also an atmospheric scientist. In 1973 he was part of a team investigating summertime smog in the UK and Ireland. Up until then the idea that the UK, with its damp grey summers, could experience smog like Los Angeles was thought so improbable that no one had made measurements to check. Lovelock and team set up a line of measurement sites from a water tower in Sibton, Suffolk, to Adrigole, near Cork. Not only was there enough smog in the UK to breach US health limits but it was taking days to form in the air, sometimes from sources up to 620 miles (1,000km) away in continental Europe.  They concluded that controlling our summertime air pollution needed European-wide cooperation. This is still valid today."

=========================================
Greenland is a Canary in a Coal Mine
By Joe Bastardi, Weatherbell Analytics
(Editing by P. Gosselin)
Nowhere on the planet is there a better example than Greenland of how nature, and not man, is master of the planet’s fate. It demonstrates the process by which there is a natural cap to warming.
How so? Well, first of all let’s look at what’s an amazing 5-year recovery in Greenland snow and ice:

The pinkish line is how far above average we are, the extra yellow tacked on means pink and yellow is the increase since 2012.
I want you to look at that. Suppose it had gone the other way, and instead had DROPPED to 2012 levels from where it is now. Just what do you think would be reported today in the climate media?
Now this is all in the midst of what is the warmest 2-year stretch of temperatures in the satellite era. Let’s not kid around or make excuses; it is by UAH:

It is by the NCEP initialization criteria, which has been doing well in tracking the ups and downs:

This makes some sense because Greenland is a very cold place, even when it’s warmer, and so with more water vapor available from the warmed oceans, it snows more where it’s cold enough to snow. That is simple intuition and proven fact, and I didn’t need any big grant money to come up with that. So increases of water vapor in very cold places produce more snow, and CO2 is not causing more or less snow.

The idea that CO2 can suddenly warm the planet and create these situations is nonsense. At the very most, and this is a stretch, stored CO2 in the lower levels does have some warming effect by influencing the air around it, but quantifying it against the large scale drivers is by no means settled science.
Greenland colder this year
The oceans today are not a product of the increase of 1 molecule of CO2 out of every 10,000 of air over 100 years, but instead large scale events that can be centuries in the making. So someone can claim that warming leads to more snow (by the way that was taught in my climate classes in the 70s), which in turn leads to cooling since more snow makes winters last longer in areas where sun angles are low.  Nature’s version of Le Chateliers, or the old adage: for every action, there is a reaction!
Predictably, Greenland in 2017…

…is cooler than it was in 2016:

But the history of Greenland shows that the current warming does not match other warm periods shown by the ice core sampling:

Above is another proxy for global temps, and it is showing a current “hockey stick” look, which certainly backs that idea. The problem is that in the cherry-pick world of climate hysteria, scientists ignore the rest of the periods, thinking that somehow it’s valid global proxy when it agrees with them, and not when it doesn’t. But whether tree rings in Mongolia or wherever, or ice cores in Greenland, the earth shows a wide and varied, always acting and reacting climate system that is independent of whatever minute influences man might offer.
Harsh winter threatening Europe?
To say there is no influence at all to me is folly, anything and everything contributes to the system, but the question lies in its weight. To say CO2 is the climate control knob in the face of what we know and see, seems beyond folly, almost a religious fanaticism. Greenland is indeed a canary in the coal mine as I have heard it put when snow and ice was melting. Problem is that it’s like nature: it’s a canary that changes its tune. Anyone listening?
Tell you what. If there’s blocking over Greenland this winter and I am in Europe, I’d really look out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s Energiewende is faltering badly.
At least that’s what Christoph Eisenring of the Zurich based daily NZZ writes here, claiming the Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) is a false model for the rest of the world.
The truth is that the Energiewende is on the same path as the construction of the Berlin BER airport – racing down the highway to total debacle – something that everyone is doing their damnedest to ignore and wishing it would just go away.
Moreover, Eisenring writes, it is causing “collateral damage” to Germany’s neighboring countries, as huge supply fluctuations threaten to destabilize their grids and electricity markets.
Only 1% of rated capacity!
The Energiewende has led to some of the most expensive electricity prices in the world, and it is not difficult to understand why. Eisenring uses the example of German power production on January 24, 2017 when at 7 a.m. German demand was at 70 gigawatts but the country’s 84 gigawatts of installed solar and wind capacity were putting out a mere 0.8 gigawatts, i.e. only about 1% of capacity.
That means doubling or even ten-folding German solar and wind capacity would still not be enough at times. That in turn means that Germany is forced to run two separate systems: a renewable one and a conventional system. “That’s costly,” Eisenring comments.
Highly inefficient
The highly erratic supply of wind and sun means the conventional power plants are constantly being slowed down or cranked up in a desparate race to keep the grid stable. Eisenring illustrates:
It is as if you would constantly be putting on the brakes and accelerating on the highway while driving from Bern to Zürich: It is a highly inefficient way of production.”
Adding more renewables is only going to mean more hours of oversupply when the wind blows and the sun shines, Eisenring reminds. It will lead to even greater inefficiency and instability.
1000 hours of negative prices possible annually
To unload the excess power, wholesale prices have been increasingly falling into the negative range, which means the grid operator has to pay buyers to “buy” the unwanted power. Eisenring reports that last year German power prices on the wholesale exchange markets were negative for 97 hours, which is close to 2 hours a week. But that figure will only grown as more wind and solar come online. Eisenring writes:
However, there are estimates that this could be the case for 1000 hours by 2022.”

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




That comes out to be about 20 hours a week. No market can survive that.
Another problem, Eisenring writes, is the havoc that Germany’s bucking bronco power grid is wreaking on the grids of neighboring countries like the Czech Republic, Poland, France, Austria or Switzerland, to name a few – all caused by the “exorbitant subsidization of renewables.”
€520 billion per year by 2025!
Germany’s Energiewende and its high costs are hammering consumers, many of whom are no longer able to pay their electric bills and are thus losing power by the tens of thousands of households. Eisenring cites one study that estimates the Energiewende cost Germany 150 billion euros in 2015 alone, and by 2025 it could cost 520 billion euros.
Storage still a pipe dream
Storing surplus electricity is also currently unfeasible, noting that German renowned economist Hans-Werner Sinn calculated 125 million Tesla automobile batteries would be needed. Yet, even such a huge quantity of batteries still would not be enough to allow wintertime driving, Sinn calculates!
Eisenring also writes that so far Germany’s Energiewendehas led to very little protection of the environment, as much of the CO2 emissions have been offshored and have fallen only 6% in the electricity sector since the feed-in act was enacted in 2000.
Eisenring writes that Germany will not meet its 2020 40%-emissions-reductions target. Currently the country has reduced emissions by 27% since 1990, but most of that coming from shutting down the shoddy old industries of former communist East Germany after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall.
Government still insisting it’s “our success story”
Yet, this glaring failure has not made any impression on the German government, as it recently released a propaganda brochure extoling the virtues of the Energiewende, calling it “our success story“, “sustainable and safe“, affordable and plannable” and “reliable and intelligent“.
Eisenring comments on the government’s propagandist self-assessment:
With this assessment Berlin is quite alone.”
Early this year Germany’s federal budget office determined that “the Ministry of Economics had in fact no overview of the financial impacts of the Energiewende” and that policymakers had “underestimated the impacts of renewable energy on the entire energy system“.

"A cloud of smoke and soot bigger than the European Union is billowing across Siberia as wildfires in the Arctic Circle rage into an unprecedented third month. The normally frozen region, which is a crucial part of the planet’s cooling system, is spewing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and worsening the manmade climate disruption that created the tinderbox conditions. Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system.  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “could not have occurred without human-induced climate change”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was made at least 50 times more likely by global heating, linking it directly to climate change. Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding.  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America. When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California.  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons. Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made three times more likely by climate change. Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage. Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely. Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK, it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather. A spate of huge fires in northern Russia, Alaska, Greenland and Canada discharged 50 megatonnes of CO2 in June and 79 megatonnes in July, far exceeding the previous record for the Arctic. The intensity of the blazes continues with 25 megatonnes in the first 11 days of August – extending the duration beyond even the most persistent fires in the 17-year dataset of Europe’s satellite monitoring system. Mark Parrington, a scientist in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, said the previous record was just a few weeks. “We haven’t seen this before,” he said. “The fire intensity is still well above average.” He said the affected regions previously registered unusually high temperatures and a low level of soil moisture, which created the perfect conditions for ignition. Globally, June and July were the hottest months ever measured. Russia has suffered most. Last month, the president, Vladimir Putin, mobilised the army to fight the blazes and four Siberian regions declared a state of emergency. But fires continue to rage. The Earth observation scientist Josef Aschbacher said that in Siberia alone, the two-month inferno had destroyed 4.3m hectares of taiga forest. The smoke has spread further still. Antti Lipponen, of the Finnish Meteorological Institute, estimates the affected area at 5m square kilometres. “For comparison, the area of EU is about 4.5m km² and the area of contiguous US about 8.1m km²”, he tweeted. The cloud is billowing north-east and is forecast to reach Alaska, where this year’s fires have already scorched an area bigger than all the wildfires that devastated California last year. Carly Phillips, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said Alaskan fires had burned 18.1m acres of forest since 2000, more than double the amount over the previous 20 years. “Carbon emissions from these wildfires could exacerbate climate warming for decades to come,” she wrote in a blogpost. “Alaska’s ecosystems store huge quantities of carbon both as permafrost and soil that has accumulated over millennia. Wildfires destabilise these stores of carbon by combusting soil and accelerating permafrost thaw, both of which release heat-trapping gases to the atmosphere.” The black soot also settles on what is left of the Arctic ice, weakening its ability to reflect the heat of the sun. In Greenland, satellite images this month revealed fires stretching across an area 380km wide, adding to the pressures of an Arctic heatwave that caused a record melt-off of the world’s second biggest ice sheet. This week, a huge wildfire in the Qeqqata region left a smouldering area of 6.9km². Since the start of the year, more than 13.1m hectares have burned, according to Greenpeace, which says this has released as much carbon dioxide as a year’s worth of exhaust fumes from 36m cars. The Arctic is not the only afflicted region. So far this year, the EU has had 1,600 fires bigger than 30 hectares, which is four times the annual average over the previous decade, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. About 1,000 holidaymakers had to evacuate resorts in Gran Canaria this week to escape wildfires. Last month, campers had to abandon their tents due to a fast-spreading blaze in southern France during a heatwave. In the UK, the Fire Brigades Union says there have been 10% more callouts this year, which has overstretched emergency resources. Firefighter numbers had fallen by a fifth since 2010 due to government cuts, the union said."

Solar Forcing Of Modern, Historic Arctic Sea Ice
Only Slightly Less Sea Ice Now Than Little Ice Age

In a new paper (Stein et al., 2017), scientists find that Arctic sea ice retreat and advance is modulated by variations in solar activity.
In addition, the sea ice cover during the last century has only slightly retreated from the extent reached during coldest centuries of the Little Ice Age (1600s to 1800s AD), which had the highest sea ice cover of the last 10,000 years and flirted with excursions into year-round sea ice.
The Medieval Warm Period sea ice record (~900 to 1200 AD) had the lowest coverage since the Roman era ~2,000 years ago.
Of note, the paper makes no reference to carbon dioxide or anthropogenic forcing as factors modulating Arctic sea ice.



Stein et al., 2017
The causes that are controlling the decrease in sea ice are still under discussion. In several studies changes in extent, thickness and drift of Arctic sea ice are related to changes in the overall atmospheric circulation patterns as reflected in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO). The NAO and AO are influencing changes of the relative position and strength of the two major surface-current systems of the Arctic Ocean.
The increase in sea ice extent during the late Holocene seems to be a circum-Arctic phenomenon, coinciding with major glacier advances on Franz Josef Land, Spitsbergen and Scandinavia.  The increase in sea ice may have resulted from the continuing cooling trend due to decreased solar insolation and reduced heat flow from the Pacific.
The increase in sea ice extent during the late Holocene seems to be a circum-Arctic phenomenon as PIP25-based sea ice records from the Fram Strait, Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea and Chukchi Sea  display a generally quite similar evolution, all coinciding with the decrease in solar radiation.
The main factors controlling the millennial variability in sea ice and surface-water productivity are probably changes in surface water and heat flow from the Pacific into the Arctic Ocean as well as the long-term decrease in summer insolation, whereas short-term centennial variability observed in the high-resolution middle Holocene record was possibly triggered by solar forcing.

Robust substantiation for the trends documented in this new Arctic sea ice record comes from a 2005 paper by Lassen and Thejll entitled “Multi-decadal variation of the East Greenland Sea- Ice Extent: AD 1500-2000.”   Shown below is an annotated graph from the paper revealing Iceland’s sea ice cover during the last millennium.  These scientists also link sea ice variations to solar activity, namely solar cycle length.  Notice the direct correspondence between the Arctic trends as a whole (from Stein et al., 2017) and the trends for Iceland.



Lessen and Thejll, 2005
[W]e find that the recently reported retreat of the ice in the Greenland Sea  may be related to the termination of the so-called Little Ice Age in the early twentieth century. We also look at the approximately 80 year variability of the Koch [sea ice] index and compare it to the similar periodicity found in the solar cycle length, which is a measure of solar activity. A close correlation (R=0.67) of high significance (0.5 % probability of a chance occurrence) is found between the two patterns, suggesting a link from solar activity to the Arctic Ocean climate.
The ’low frequency oscillation’ that dominated the ice export through the Fram Strait as well as the extension of the sea-ice in the Greenland Sea and Davis Strait in the twentieth century may therefore be regarded as part of a pattern that has existed through at least four centuries. The pattern is a natural feature, related to varying solar activity. The considerations of the impact of natural sources of variability on arctic ice extent are of relevance for concerns that the current withdrawal of ice may entirely be due to human activity. Apparently, a considerable fraction of the current withdrawal could be a natural occurrence.

"The top priority of government is security of the people. Yet on the greatest threat of all, most governments are failing abysmally. As the global influence of western democracies wanes with the ascendancy of China, India and other emerging countries, the resulting power struggle is diverting attention from the great issues the world faces, to their symptoms.  The neoliberal market economy, with its unregulated consumption and rapacious short-term outlook, is destroying modern civilisation. The warning signs are obvious, not least burgeoning high-consuming populations, massive biodiversity loss and multiple resource scarcities. Yet rather than reform an unsustainable system, political leaders scramble to prop it up and compound the problem. The result is Brexit, Trump’s Mexican wall, escalating Middle East tension, the US-China trade standoff, a global arms and space race, Amazon deforestation and much more. In their quest for power, leaders – both democratic and authoritarian – ignore the one issue that is inexorably changing that system, namely human-induced climate change. This is an existential threat to human civilisation that will render current political priorities irrelevant as climatic consequences move beyond human influence. Countering this threat requires unprecedented global co-operation to initiate emergency action. Yet leaders opt for conflict, while suppressing information on the implications of their climate inaction. In May, we published a short paper that included a simple 3C global warming scenario for 2050, outlining the hard-nosed practical impact of climate change, as opposed to more theoretical scientific and business risk disclosure situations. This information was not new, but prompted extensive global discussion: some considered the situation entirely credible, others felt it too extreme. What became clear was the thirst for practical information of this kind. In response, we recently published a follow-up analysis: “The Third Degree: Evidence and implications for Australia of climate-related security risk”, detailing the basis for our assumptions on issues such as chronic water shortages, coastal inundation, mass migration and extreme heat – plus an in-depth global 3C scenario originally published by US national security experts in 2007. We also propose a major scenario-planning initiative for Australia. Scenario-planning does not forecast, predict or express preferences for the future; rather it is storytelling, painting pictures of alternative worlds that might emerge, to assist policymakers in imagining and thinking about future possibilities. Strategy is then assessed against each possible future. One of the initial tasks is to identify the “official future” – the future as it is supposed to be, upon which prevailing strategy is based. A large amount of political capital is tied up in that view, typically the result of group-think generated by ideology or by business models that have stood the test of time but may be inappropriate in the future. Scenario-planning explores the future, allowing constructive discussion on alternatives incorporating the full range of credible evidence. In particular, there must be a preparedness to think beyond conventional wisdom, after which a reassessment of the official future is often inevitable, and proactively undertaken. Nowhere is this more necessary than in Australia, the continent most exposed to climate change, where the official future for the last two decades has been, and remains, climate denial and delay. Political expediency, blinkered ideology and short-term business thinking rejects or deflects climate science and expert advice. Predatory delay is used to prolong the life of our high-carbon economy for short-term financial gain, irrespective of the damage to society. Policy, such as it is, views climate change as a non-problem. The blatant inconsistency of Australia’s position beggars belief. We are signatories to the UNFCCC, supposedly committed to avoiding dangerous climate change, which is already happening. Australia ratified the Paris agreement to restrict temperature increase below 2C and ideally towards 1.5C, yet our emissions are rising rapidly even though there is no carbon budget remaining to stay below even 2C. Incredibly, we ramp up new fossil fuel projects: Adani coal, gas expansion, fracking in NT and WA, and more. Then we have the gall to carry over unused carbon credits from the Kyoto protocol to obscure the failure of our wholly inadequate Paris emission reduction commitments; credits which were  unjustified in the first place. We are already the fifth largest carbon polluter globally when exports are included – about 5% of global emissions. On current projections, by 2030 Australia will be responsible for a massive 13% of global emissions. Our fossil fuel industries are subsidised annually by about US$29bn or 2.3% of GDP, far in excess of anything given to the low carbon industries. And this in a country with probably the greatest low-carbon energy potential in the world – potential we are wasting, blocked by deliberately obstructive federal policy. Australia’s climate stance is totally untenable in geopolitical terms, nothing less than a crime against humanity, as Pacific countries continually point out. The federal government does its utmost to hide these facts from public view. Accordingly, Australia must undertake serious scenario-planning to inform the public of the criminal damage being inflicted upon them by their government, and to develop contingencies for emergency action as the official future of accelerating high-carbon growth inevitably falls apart in the near future. The government’s role should be to protect the future from the past, not the past from the future. When government refuses to lead, others must. • Ian Dunlop was formerly an international oil, gas and coal industry executive, chair of the Australian Coal Association and CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Directors.

Firstly, wind energy protest organization vernunftkraft.de posted a chart showing the sheer absurdity of relying on the haphazard electricity supply that wind and solar energies are.
Last Sunday Germany saw windy and sunny conditions, meaning the country’s installed wind and solar systems were running at high capacity. This however led to excess power flooding into the German grid, and thus a plummet in exchange electricity prices.

Market exchange price of electricity on the EEX Leipzig exchange. On April 30 and May 1st 2017, wholesale prices went deeply negative. Source: EEX Marktdaten Strom, by Rolf Schuster. www.vernunftkraft.de/uploads/Ahlborn.pdf
The chart above shows that electricity was in fact sold at negative prices, dipping to an astonishing low of almost 75 euros per megawatt hour.
Unfortunately the money to pay people to “buy” the electricity never gets paid to the consumer. Rather it gets paid mostly to foreign wholesalers. Yet, the German grid operator needs to recoup the money it paid to have the wholesalers to accept the power. In the end, the domestic consumers in Germany wind up with the bill.
How much did the negative prices seen over the past weekend end up costing the German consumers? One reader calculated it and came up with the figure of over 41 million euros! And because May 1st was a national holiday, the demand for German power was low, and there was no use for all the extra power flooding into the grid. It’s like cooking dinner – after everyone has already eaten. And because there is no fridge, the garbage man has to be called and paid to dispose of it. So far electricity cannot be stored on a meaningful scale.
Wild supply variability
Continuing on the folly of Germany’s renewable energy, engineering expert Dr. Detlef Ahlborn authored a post at the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), declaring the transition to renewable energies a failure and that it will remain so as long as a solution for storing the energy is not found.
Again the huge problem is the extremely erratic, uncontrolled supply of the power, as the following German wind energy supply chart clearly illustrates:

Figure 3: Wind power production Germany from 2011 to 2016. Installed rated capacity rose from about 27 GW to about 48 GW. However the power that was actually produced (dark blue) is in fact often only a tiny fraction. Overall, Germany’s demand hovers about 70 GW. Source: Rolf Schuster, data from EEX Leipzig.
More variable then rolling a die

Dr. Ahlborn describes the extreme variability of wind power in Germany as follows:

The variability of German wind power production is about 70% greater than the numbers you’d see rolling a die. If German power providers ran their plants like throwing a die, the power would flow more uniformly. [1]”

Of course wind energy proponents like to say that the solution is a European-wide integrated network where if the wind is not blowing in one region, then excess power in another region can fill in the gap. After all, “the wind is always blowing somewhere in Europe” they like to say. However, the following chart plainly illustrates that this is far more a fallacy than a truth.

Very often when there’s plenty of wind in Germany (or very little), the case is the same in the rest of Europe. With that kind of supply, good luck trying to balance any grid that is overly dependent on wind energy.
Ahlborn writes that combining the power grids to form one large one only serves to add up the variability and not reduce it.
“Unworthy” for Germany
Summarizing Ahlborn calls the total result of wind energy so far “bitter”:
This Energiewende [transition to renewables] is unworthy for a country with such a tradition in science and technology. We could have known if we had just given it a bit of thought. But who wanted to know?
We’ll find out at the latest when we start looking for those who are responsible for this debacle, and policymakers attempt to run from taking responsibility for this disaster. Our former economics minister has already taken the first step.”
To that, EIKE added: It can only be hoped that the former economics minister (Sigmar Gabriel) will cause less damage in his new position as foreign minister.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the most highly-cited estimate of recent (1992 – 2011) polar ice sheet melt rates, the land ice on Greenland and Antarctica has been contributing to sea level rise at a rate of 0.59 mm/year in the modern era, which means the equivalent of 5.9 centimeters (2.3 inches) per century of sea level rise might eventually accrue if the polar ice sheets continue melting at current rates for the next 10 decades.
Shepherd et al., 2012

Since 1992 [through 2011], the polar ice sheets [Antarctica and Greenland] have contributed, on average, 0.59 ± 0.20 millimeter year−1 to the rate of global sea-level rise.

Of course, a sea level rise rate contribution from Greenland and Antarctica that amounts to a little more than 2 inches per century is not particularly alarming.  And when observed sea level rise contribution rates from melting ice sheets don’t elicit the headlining attention they deserve, it’s time to promulgate climate modeling catastrophes that might occur at some point in the distant future.
For example, earlier this year Slate‘s resident meteorologist Eric Holthaus excitedly embraced the James Hansen ice-melt catastrophe paper (Hansen et al., 2016) as a welcome tenet of a supposedly authoritative scientific canon: “James Hansen’s Bombshell Warning Is Now Part of the Scientific Canon”.
The paper, which has undergone some wording revisions since the original version appeared in July, 2015, apparently “concludes” that the polar ice sheets will soon melt catastrophically, and that this ice sheet melt contribution will in turn result in sea level rise of “at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years“.
Eric Holthaus, Slate:

“The study—written by James Hansen, NASA’s former lead climate scientist, and 16 co-authors, many of whom are ered among the top in their fields—concludes that glaciers in Greenland and Antarctica will melt 10 times faster than previous consensus estimates, resulting in sea level rise of at least 10 feet in as little as 50 years.“

Again, the combined Greenland and Antarctica ice sheet melt contribution to sea level rise was 0.59 mm/year during 1992 – 2011 (Shepherd et al., 2012), or about 6 cm (2.3 inches) per century.  To achieve James Hansen’s claimed sea level rise prediction of 10 feet (3.05 meters) within 50 years due to rapidly melting Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, the current melt rates would have to increase by a factor of 100.  Instead of the polar ice sheet contribution rate of 0.23 of an inch per decade for 1992-2011, the rate in the next 50 years will need to average 23 inches per decade — two orders of magnitude more than presently observed.
And for the record, the observed melt-rate contribution from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets of 0.59 mm/yr for 1992 – 2011 is very likely an overestimate.  For one, NASA has reported that there was an overall ice mass gain for Antarctica during this same period (1992-2008), and thus a reduction in sea level rise equivalent to -0.23 mm/yr (rather than a net positive contribution of +0.19 mm/yr as determined by Shepherd et al., 2011).  Secondly, in current datasets the baseline period for establishing the surface mass balance (SMB) of the Greenland ice sheet is the 1961-1990 tricade.  However, those 30 years were notoriously cold in Greenland, a full 1.5 degrees C colder than the 1920-1940s period, when Greenland was actually as warm or warmer than recent decades.  If the baseline data were not centered on the coldest decades of the century, but instead included the 1920s-1940s warm period, the record of net “loss” for the Greenland ice sheet since the 1990s would be significantly reduced, and there may have been an overall net mass gain relative to the 1920s-’40s for recent decades.  Succinctly, different baseline data would yield an even more negligible Greenland ice sheet contribution to sea level rise for 1992-2011 than reported by Shepherd et al., 2011 (0.4 mm/yr, or 1.6 inches per century).
Considering Paleoclimate Data, Sea Level Rise Projections Of Even 1 Meter Per Century Are ‘Sheer Nonsense’, ‘Demagoguery’
World-renown scientist Dr. Nils-Axel Mörner, a sea level expert who has authored hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific publication during his career, has recently weighed in on the preposterousness of claiming sea levels will rise even 1 meter in the next 100 years — let alone over 3 meters in the next 50, as James Hansen claims.  Using past records of sea level rise rates from the earliest decades and centuries of the Holocene (~11,000 years ago), Mörner concludes that it is not possible for modern sea levels to rise at rates of 10 mm/year (1 meter/century) — or faster than they did during a time when much of the Northern Hemisphere was still buried kilometers-deep in ice and temperatures were rising far more rapidly than today.

Mörner,  2016

Sea level is globally varying between ±0.0 and +1.0 mm/yr (0.5 ± 0.5 mm/yr). … At 11,000 BP we had enormous amounts of ice still left in the huge continental ice caps of the Last Ice Age. In Canada, the ice front was in St. Lawrence lowland, and in Scandinavia, the ice margin was at Stockholm. At the warming pulse ending the Pleistocene and starting the Holocene, ice melted at an exceptionally strong forcing. Today, there is neither ice nor climate forcing that in any way can be compared to what happened 11,000 – 10,000 BP. The conclusion is obvious; we can never in present time have any ice melting and sea level rise as strong- and certainly not stronger-than that occurring at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Therefore, a rate of sea level rise of +10.0 mm/yr or 1.0 m per century can be held as the absolutely ultimate value of any present day sea level rise. Any present rise in sea level must be far below this value to be realistic in view of past records and the physical factors controlling ice melting. Therefore, we can also dismiss any claim of sea level rise exceeding 1 m in the next century as sheer nonsense and unfounded demagoguery.


Sea Levels Currently Rising Between 0 – 1 mm/yr; Modeled ‘Corrections’ To Sea Level Rise Data Artificially And Erroneously Raise Rates
A year ago, Dr. Mörner detailed his comprehensive critique of the alterations to observed data (euphemistically referred to as “corrections”).  He determined that if the “corrections” (i.e., modeled adjustments that artificially raise sea levels) for the satellite data are removed, sea levels only rose at a rate of 0.45 mm/year (2 inches per century) between 1992-2015, which is about 1/7th of the rate of rise reported by altimetry datasets.
Mörner,  2015

The satellite altimetry records are claimed to be “a proxy for ocean water volume changes”, but behind the curves are unspecified “corrections” hidden, applied by NOAA and CU in order to obtain the product they personally assumed to be the correct “proxy of ocean water volume changes”. There is a major problem, however: their satellite altimetry records differ by 100% to 800% from observed tide gauge measurements. With the removal of GIA corrections … from the satellite altimetry data, we finally obtain agreements among global tide gauge data, costal morphology data and satellite altimetry data; all agreeing on a mean global eustatic sea level factor somewhere within the zone ±0.0 to +1.0 mm/yr.
The mean of 182 sites (excluding a few outliers) scattered all over the globe is 1.6 mm/ yr. Because of long-term subsidence of many river mouth sites and site-specific compaction problems, this value may, in fact, represent a slightly too high value. The key sites here discussed provide values of about 0.0 mm/yr, and the Kattegatt and North Sea records give firm values around 1.0 ± 0.1 mm/yr. This data set is in deep conflict with the high rates proposed by the IPCC and satellite altimetry. The differences in rates can only be understood in terms of errors and mistakes. The true mean global eustatic component is likely to be found in the zone ranging from +2.0 mm/yr to ±0.0 mm/yr, and most probably in the lower half of this zone; i.e. within 1.0 – 0.0 mm/yr. The error was found to be in the satellite altimetry values for reasons of incorrect “corrections”
The only data set which hangs far above the others is the IPCC predictions. Those data, however, refer to assumptions and model out-puts, and are, by no means, anchored in observational facts. … [I]t is high time to abandon the idea of global isostatic adjustment, and to stop all kinds of GIA corrections of records of sea level changes (i.e. satellite altimetry, GRACE, tide gauges, etc.).


The reported rates exceeding 3 mm/year are based on models instead of direct observational measurements.  Echoing a 2015 paper from Beenstock et al., two more new papers (another by Mörner) indicate that observations (i.e., non-modeled, non-adjusted measurements from tide gauges from all over the world) of global sea level rise range somewhere between 0 and 1 mm/yr, or a few inches per century.
Beenstock et al., 2015

Using recently developed methods for nonstationary time series, we find that sea levels rose in 7 % of tide gauge locations and fell in 4 %. The global mean increase is 0.39–1.03 mm/year.

Mörner,  2016

Observational facts recorded and controllable in the field tell a quite different story of actual sea-level rise than the ones based on model simulations, especially all those who try to endorse a preconceived scenario of disastrous flooding to come. “Poster sites” like Tuvalu, Vanuatu, and Kiribati in the Pacific have tide gauge stations indicating stable sea-level conditions over the last 20–30 years. The Maldives, Goa, Bangladesh, and several additional sites in the Indian Ocean provide firm field evidence of stable sea-level conditions over the last 40–50 years. Northeast Europe provides excellent opportunities to test regional eustasy, now firmly being set at +1.0 ± 0.1 mm/year. Other test areas like Venice, Guyana–Surinam, Qatar, and Perth provide a eustatic factor of ±0.0 mm/year. We now have a congruent picture of actual global sea-level changes, i.e., between ±0.0 to +1.0 mm/year. This implies little or no threat for future sea-level problems.

Parker and Ollier, 2016

Tide gauges provide the most reliable measurements, and best data to assess the rate of change. We show as the naïve averaging of all the tide gauges included in the PSMSL surveys show “relative” rates of rise about +1.04 mm/year (570 tide gauges of any length). If we consider only 100 tide gauges with more than 80 years of recording the rise is only +0.25 mm/year. This naïve averaging has been stable and shows that the sea levels are slowly rising but not accelerating. …The satellite altimetry returns a noisy signal so that a +3.2 mm/year trend is only achieved by arbitrary “corrections”.
We conclude that if the sea levels are only oscillating about constant trends everywhere as suggested by the tide gauges, then the effects of climate change are negligible, and the local patterns may be used for local coastal planning without any need of purely speculative global trends based on emission scenarios.

Share this...FacebookTwitterJohn Stossel conducted an unusual interview, one where the head of NASA GISS, Gavin Schmidt, refused to appear together on the set with skeptic Dr. Roy Spencer, climatologist at the University of Alabama.

According to Stossel about a dozen scientists had been invited to debate Spencer, but they refused to do so on air.
Great uncertainty
At the start Spencer tells Stossel that scientists in his opinion do not have a clue at this stage just how much of the warming can be attributed to man, saying it could be 10% or 90%.
Next a fidgety Gavin Schmidt appeared, insisting that the climate signatures of methane and CO2 “are very very clear“.
He then absurdly claimed that humans built its cities and infrastructure near the sea with the assumption that climate would not change and because “we didn’t expect the sea level to rise“.
Concedes Obama was mistaken
Surprisingly, at the 3:30 mark, Schmidt even conceded (reluctantly) that President Obama had been mistaken when he claimed hurricanes were increasing. When pressed by Stossel, the NASA GISS head was forced to admit that hurricane activity has in fact been showing no trend.

Problem is in the future
The inconvenient chart presented by Stossel actually suggests hurricane activity has been decreasing, which seemed a bit embarrassing to the NASA scientist. But Schmidt insisted the problem remained in the future (i.e. models): “Now what’s going on in the future, that is what we are concerned about.”
Ducks debate
When asked why not stay on the set and debate Spencer, Schmidt said: “I’m not interested.” And walked away.
Spencer returned and summed up telling viewers that the proposed green energy solutions were unrealistic and expensive, and that they would be far more damaging and deadly to the poor than the problem of climate change itself.
CO2 actually a good thing
Spencer told viewers that it is amazing how little CO2 there is in the atmosphere: “My long-term prediction is that eventually we are going to realize that more CO2 in the atmosphere is actually a good thing,” Spencer said.
Spencer ended the interview by telling that many scientists in fact agree with him, but that they are afraid to speak up about it for fear of losing funding.

"It is fascinating to ponder what brought a group of ancient settlers to the windswept islands of Orkney. One thing is certain: 5,000 years ago the Neolithic village of Skara Brae, fed by a bountiful supply of sealife, was a thriving community. Tucked away in the dunes, on the edge of a horseshoe bay, the inhabitants built comfortable dwellings furnished with stone dressers and beds, played games, made pottery and tools, and even found time to craft jewellery from walrus tusks and whale teeth. No one can be certain when or why, but at some point an apparently abrupt event emptied the village of its inhabitants, leaving the nearby dunes to blanket Skara Brae for thousands of years.  The village is once again under threat – a recent climate vulnerability study, carried out by a group of environment and heritage experts on behalf of Historic Environment Scotland, concluded the Unesco-protected settlement was extremely vulnerable to sea-level change, increased precipitation and storm intensity. A century-old seawall now protects the main part of the site, but nearby, recent storms have nibbled away at the delicate sand dunes and peaty soils, leaving the site horribly exposed. The biggest fear is that one mighty storm, with just the right wind direction and swell, could do irreparable damage and sweep Skara Brae into the sea."

Dear Herr Beck
We take the liberty to bring your attention to the ZDF show ‘Frontal 21’, broadcast on 24 January, 2017, and one of its segments on newly elected US President Donald J. Trump, which in our view was completely defamatory.
Using suggestive, selected film footage and accompanying audio, the President of our most important ally and the leading western democracy was in spirit and in fact put in the same proximity as Adolf Hitler.
This is not only untruthful and completely defamatory, it also trivializes the historical assessment of an unprecedented crime committed by German war criminals and those responsible for the murder of 6 million European Jews.
We bring this case up because we assume that the broadcasting of this deliberate false content got by you, and so you did not exercise the input of your political and ethical responsibility for the broadcast content of this institution of public television.
With all regards for how essential freedom of the press is for democracy, we are convinced that the irresponsible dissemination of false historical references and defamatory content cannot and must not be a part of programs that are transmitted by public broadcaster ZDF. We therefore hereby request your corresponding and appropriate action to correct this scandalous situation and to be sure that this type of incident is effectively prevented from occurring again in the future.
For the sake of good order, we further point out that we have notified the appropriate US authorities for the possibility of legal proceedings concerning the appalling poor behavior of the “Frontal 21“ editorial board and to check for the possibility of launching a criminal proceeding against the responsible persons.
Yours truly
Dr. Rafael Korenzecher

"Jacinda Ardern has declared that “Australia has to answer to the Pacific” on climate change, saying that New Zealand is doing what it can to limit global emissions to 1.5C and expects other nations to do the same.However, the New Zealand prime minister stopped short of saying New Zealand would throw its weight behind the smaller Pacific nations who are urging Australia to commit to a rapid transition from a coal-based economy at this year’s Pacific Islands Forum. “Issues around Australia’s domestic policy are issues for Australia,” she said, when asked about Australia’s coal use. Ardern said she had “every expectation that this Pacific Islands Forum will be dominated by climate change” and reiterated her government’s commitment to reducing emissions, citing the goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2035, which is currently working its way through New Zealand parliament. “Like our Pacific Island neighbours, we will continue that international call, we will continue to say that New Zealand will do our bit and we have an expectation that everyone else will as well; we have to.” Pacific leaders have this week been urging Australia to commit to urgent action to reduce emissions. On Monday, the Fijian prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, appealed to Australia in a speech “to do everything possible to achieve a rapid transition from coal to energy sources that do not contribute to climate change”, saying it posed an “existential threat” to Pacific islands. Ardern refused to comment on reports that Australia has been attempting to water down the language on climate change in the communique that is due to come out of the PIF on Thursday after the leaders’ retreat. Climate Home News reported that an annotated draft of the Pacific Islands Forum declaration showed Australia trying to suppress references to the climate “crisis”, 1.5C, carbon neutrality, a ban on new coal plants and phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies. Greenpeace said that Australia’s plans to water down the communique could see it become “the pariah of the Pacific”. “How does Morrison reconcile calling the Pacific family while he persistently ignores our demands for Australia to reduce its emissions?” said Joseph Moeono-Kolio, Greenpeace’s head of Pacific. Scott Morrison, who touched down in Funafuti about an hour after Ardern, set a positive tone in his first public speaking appearance, at the launch of a Pacific skills portal, at which he did not take questions. Morrison said the Pacific Islands Forum was a “family gathering” and that “when families come together they talk about the stuff that matters, that’s most important to them. Over the next few days that’s exactly what we’ll do.” His only reference to what are anticipated to be heated debates on the climate crisis was to say the leaders would be “talking about the future of our environment” as part of their discussions, as well as the future of our economies and jobs. Morrison cited his government’s renewed focus on the region, the so-called Pacific Step-Up, saying, as he has several times before: “If you’re going to step up you have to show up, and Australia’s going to show up, we’re not just going to show up here, we’re going to show up for the hard conversations, the good conversations, the family conversations that we have, that’s very much the spirit with which we’re engaging.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German SAT.1 NRW site brings our attention to yet another glittering jewel of climate and environmental folly. This ranks close to the weed-covered solar park we reported on a few years back.
SAT.1 reports how a revolutionary zero-carbon, “sustainable” green home went from being an example for the future of green home architecture, to a hazardous waste site in just a matter of months.
2.4 million euro dream
The “unique” self-reliant house located in Lippstadt, Germany, was constructed entirely of “organic materials”, costing 2.4 million euros ($2.6 million). Building began in 2014. However during 2015 the house became completely infested with dangerous mold — and has since been condemned and now will need to be gutted out.
Initially the house had been the dream of its owners, Lars and Antje Rühe. Today, having put the family’s wealth into the house, the Rühe’s now find themselves on the brink of financial and marital ruin, SAT.1 reports.
Rain soaked during construction
The house is equipped with its own water supply, solar power, and a battery storage system costing over 100,000 euros and is capable of storing power for months. During the course of construction, the organic wood-based material used for insulating the house in place of traditional fiberglass got soaked with rainwater and quickly became a hotbed for mold.

Now a hazardous material site
The mold and its spores spread through the entire building and contaminated the insulation, which now has to be removed piece by piece and disposed of as hazardous material. So toxic did the house become that it had to be fenced off to keep the public off limits. Two million spores were measured in the air of the house – the limit is only 200.
Things got far worse: In order to keep the dangerous spores from making the neighbors ill, it is now deemed necessary to build an airtight, vacuum enclosure structure around the entire house – all equipped with an air filtering system. That alone, according to SAT.1, will run another half a million euros.
To be demolished, handled as hazardous waste
It’s not even sure if the house can be salvaged at all. According to the engineer who designed the home’s energy system, “every part will need to be packed and sealed, and then disposed of as hazardous waste“.
Germany’s No.1 daily Bild writes here that the house will in fact need to be demolished, which will cost 50,000 euros.
Next comes the legal battle to determine exactly who is responsible for the debacle. Apparently the building crew covered the house with a large tarp during its construction, but according to SAT.1, it leaked and the organic insulation soaked the water up “like a sponge“.

"Capitalism is “very much part of the solution” to tackling the climate crisis, according to the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. Challenged in an interview by the Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow over whether capitalism itself was fuelling the climate emergency, Carney gave a strident defence of the economic system predicated on private ownership and growth but said companies that ignored climate change would “go bankrupt without question”.  “Capitalism is part of the solution and part of what we need to do,” he said in the interview broadcast on Wednesday. The economist, who previously worked for Goldman Sachs, said he recognised the costs of ignoring climate change were rising, but stressed there were increasing opportunities for “doing something about it”, and that capital would shift in this direction. “Now there is $120tn of capital behind that framework that is saying to companies: ‘Tell us how you are going to manage these risks’ – that’s the first thing,” Carney said. “The second thing the capitalist system needs to do is to manage the risks around climate change, be ready for the different speeds of the adjustment. And then the most important thing is to move capital from where it is today to where it needs to be tomorrow. The system is very much part of the solution.” He added: “Companies that don’t adapt – including companies in the financial system – will go bankrupt without question. [But] there will be great fortunes made along this path aligned with what society wants.” Carney, who is set to step down as governor in January after six years in the post, was interviewed at Coutts Bank in central London on Tuesday evening, where Sir David Attenborough told bankers and financiers the planet was in mortal danger and they “simply must act”. Many experts argue that ending the crisis would necessitate the end of capitalism and the introduction of a new economic model, due to the constant pursuit of GDP growth in capitalist economies where investment in fossil fuels continues to overshadow those in renewables. Others argue that capitalism harnesses innovation, which is key to the Earth’s survival and future prosperity – citing rapid advancements in renewable and clean energies. In response to Carney’s interview, Extinction Rebellion said societies must adopt more sustainable economic systems. “We are destroying our planet, and business as usual is not going to save us. We must question any system that has led us to this path of mass extinction, and look to more sustainable economic models that are not based on resource depletion and increasing emissions,” a spokesperson told the Guardian. “This is no longer about left versus right, we need to come together to face this. Political persuasion is going to be a distant memory when we are faced with failing crops and empty supermarket shelves.” The UK has committed to eliminating carbon emissions by 2050 through legislation passed last month. However, analysis published this week by the Labour party showed this target would not be met if the UK fully exploited the shale gas reserves in the country through fracking."
"The Arctic is on fire, hot on the heels of the latest scorching European heatwave. As the impact of the climate crisis mounts, more and more people are asking: how can we control this beast we have created? The scientific answer is fairly straightforward: reduce the amount of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere to zero. The sooner that’s done, the lower the stabilised temperature and the fewer devastating climate impacts we must face.  The world signed up to this in the Paris agreement, agreeing to “pursue efforts” to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, while committing to keep the rise “well below” 2C. To have just a 50% chance of meeting the 1.5C means halving global emissions over the next decade and hitting “net zero” emissions by about 2050. That means every sector of every country in the world needs to be, on average, zero emissions. That’s electricity, transport, industry, farming, the lot. For many areas of life, near-zero emissions is an attainable, if extremely ambitious, goal. We could refit our homes and use electric-powered transport from low-carbon energy sources. Energy from the sun, wind and waves could power societies worldwide. But there are some areas where zero emissions by 2050 is impossible. There will, for example, always be some emissions from the farming needed to feed more than 10 billion people this century, and there is no sign of flying long-haul on an electric plane any time soon. The answer to this is to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, using “negative emissions technologies”. By sucking carbon out of the atmosphere – at the same rate as it is being added – we can reach zero emissions. Whatever the shape of society in the future, a stable climate will require some working negative emissions technologies. They will be an indispensable tool to mop up the hard-to-eliminate emissions. How can it be done? The UK is betting on bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, BECCS, where carbon is removed from the atmosphere by crops or trees as they grow. This biomass is then burned in a power station to generate electricity, and the waste carbon dioxide is pumped far underground into old oil and gas reservoirs or saline aquifers. A second approach is to restore or enhance processes that naturally remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Forest restoration removes carbon by storing it in trees, and soils can also take up carbon, for example, if crushed silicate rocks are spread on to them, enhancing a natural chemical process. With a range of options, we might think that negative emissions means that climate change can be tackled, and tackled fast. But evidence that these technologies can work at a small demonstration scale is causing the opposite. Negative emissions are treated as a “get out of jail free” card – a licence to keep emitting and clean up the mess later with new technologies. Politicians and their advisers love them, because they can announce a target such as 1.5C while planning to exceed it, with temperatures hopefully clawed back later in the century through negative emissions. A future where carbon is scrubbed from the atmosphere is also manna from heaven for the enemies of a rapid transition away from fossil fuels. The greater the negative emissions, the less decarbonisation is needed. Negative emissions technologies are deployed as a weapon to avoid taking serious action on climate. The oil giant Shell, for example, is rolling out a scheme this autumn for UK drivers to pay an extra 1p per litre on their petrol to have this global corporation plant a tree to convince motorists that they can “drive neutral” using “natural climate solutions”. As the electric vehicle revolution approaches, Shell is again engaged in a sophisticated lobbying and disinformation campaign, putting its short-term profits above all else. But this is only part of the story: scrutinise the pathways in the recent IPCC report consistent with the 1.5C target and the stated amount of negative emissions envisaged is incredible. Most scenarios have more than 730bn tonnes of carbon dioxide sequestered as negative emissions this century. That is equivalent to all the carbon dioxide emitted since the industrial revolution by the US, the UK, Germany and China combined. There just isn’t enough land to suck up that much carbon into new forests. And using BECCS to remove this much carbon, as most scenarios assume, would require an area of new cropland larger than India, plus building a facility to store 1m tonnes of carbon a year every single day from 2025 until 2050. Negative emissions at this scale are the stuff of fantasy. While it is true that some negative emissions technologies are practically feasible at modest scales, this knowledge encourages both magical and mendacious thinking. We all want a magic bullet that solves the climate emergency, but negative emissions technologies are not it. Of course, it makes no sense to be against these technologies in principle. Investment in them is needed, as hard-to-mitigate emissions will need removing from the atmosphere, and some options such as forest restoration bring many additional benefits. But we should recognise the dual role they also play in encouraging a delay to the action we need to take: rapidly ending the use of fossil fuels. • Simon Lewis is professor of global change science at University College London"

[German text translated/edited by P Gosselin]
Climate alarm at the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) was reported on 21 March 2017 at the German online derwesten.de:

Heat waves in the Arctic – climate scientists sound the alarm
[…] During the winter in the Arctic temperatures reached near the melting point. It wasn’t the only weather extreme that climate scientists reported on. Such a heat wave occurred in the Arctic at least three times at the start of 2017, so reported the World Weather Organisation (WMO) in Geneva. Mighty Atlantic currents had delivered warm, moist air to the Arctic. At the peak of winter in the period when it should be freezing, temperatures reached near freezing on some days. The polar jet stream – a wind current that circles the planet at high altitudes – thus impacts the global weather.”

Do we really find ourselves on the verge of disaster? Is it getting hotter and hotter in the Arctic?
Let’s look at the HadCRUT4 temperatures in Arctic (Fig. 1). One clearly sees the warming phase of 1990-2005. Before and after that there were a bit wavy temperature plateaus. There hasn’t been any significant warming in the Arctic in 10 years.

Now let’s extend the time scale and look back 100 years. What a surprise: In the 1930s and 1940s there were two heat decades in the Arctic which were almost as warm as today (Fig. 2). This is just a small fact that went missing in the WMO press release and in the derwesten.de article.

The earlier Arctic heat years are impressive when we look at the temperature plot of the island city of Akureyri (Fig. 3):

Now what could have caused it to warm up in the 1930s and 1940s? Here it is enough to look back at the 60-year Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). This is easily done at the NOAA website (Fig. 4).

Figure 4: AMO
The curves at Wikipedia or elsewhere are perhaps more colorful, but they often don’t include the last years. The main drive behind the Arctic warming of the 1990s and 2000s was the simultaneously strong rise in the AMO.
The heat waves reported by the WMO happen to fit very well with the current high plateau of the AMO (Fig. 4). You don’t need to be a fortune teller to realistically estimate what remains ahead: the AMO plateau could continue for a few more years. A continued massive warming is not expected because the AMO peak has already been reached.
Eventually sometime in the coming years the drop in the AMO will begin. And correspondingly so will the Arctic temperatures . A look back at the climate history really pays off.
Winston Churchill long knew:

The further one looks back in the past, the further one sees into the future.

Some day the ladies and gentlemen at the news media will realize this. The art of fact-checking seems to have been left on the wayside since the invention of the copy-and-paste function.

"Climate change is “absolutely” already causing deaths, according to a new report on the health impacts of the climate crisis, which also predicts climate-related stunting, malnutrition and lower IQ in children within the coming decades.  The report, From Townsville to Tuvalu, produced by Monash University in Melbourne, pulled together scientific research from roughly 120 peer-reviewed journal articles to paint a picture of the health-related impacts of the climate emergency in Australia and the Pacific region.  It pointed to a 2018 report from the World Health Organisation, which predicted that between 2030 and 2050, global warming would cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year from heat stress, malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. But Misha Coleman, one of the report’s authors, stressed that deaths were already occurring. “There are absolutely people dying climate-related deaths, [especially due to] heat stress right now,” she said. “During the Black Saturday fires [in Victoria in 2009] for example, we know that people were directly killed by the fires, but there were nearly 400 additional deaths in those hot days from heat stress and heatstroke,” said Coleman. A 2017 report in the journal Nature predicted that by 2100, 75% of people around the world would be exposed to heatwaves extreme enough to kill. The report found that as well as deaths caused directly by severe weather events such as hurricanes, flooding and fires, the “more deep and insidious impact” came from the secondary impacts of climate change. “Severe weather events are causing flooding, particularly in informal settlements in the Pacific, that leads to diseases including diarrhoea, that can be very serious and fatal in people, particularly children,” said John Thwaites, chair of the Sustainable Development Institute at Monash University. The report warned that rising global temperatures would expand the habitat of mosquitos, exposing more people to diseases including dengue, chikungunya and zika, and would cause other diseases to spread into Australia, including Nipah virus, which is spread by bats, and Q fever, which is already prevalent around Townsville. “Q fever is something that is carried by a lot of wild and domesticated animals,” said Coleman. “As climate change degrades their habitat through fires and drought, these animals go looking for green grass and fresh water [and] they find themselves on golf courses and on retirees’ two-acre blocks.” Coleman said the problem comes when the infected animals defecate on the lawns and the poo is then run over by humans with lawnmowers. “It becomes airborne, it becomes this highly, highly transmissible toxin, that’s why it’s being described, even by the Lancet medical journal, as a bioweapon in our own backyard.” Climate change is expected to pose particularly stark issues for childhood development, with the report citing research that shows children born to women who were pregnant while they experienced floods in Brisbane in 2011 had lower cognitive capacity (equivalent to at least 14 points on an IQ scale), smaller vocabularies and less imaginative play at the age of two. The decreased nutritional value of staple crops as a result of higher CO2 concentration was also expected to cause stunting, anaemia and malnutrition in children, within 10 to 20 years. “What’s the future for our children?” said Coleman. “These events are more common, more frequent and not going to become less so in a short amount of time.”"
"It’s turning into the greatest environmental challenge of our age – how do we transport celebrities safely and responsibly to global eco-summits, so that they can do a better job of lecturing the rest of us about carbon emissions? The world has been agog at Camp Google, the three-day mass gathering at the luxury Verdura resort in Sicily, of 300 or so celebrity environmental activists, including Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bradley Cooper, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Chris Martin and more – too many to list, even a rumoured (but unseen) Barack Obama. Not forgetting Prince Harry, who reportedly gave a stirring speech about the environment – barefoot! A startling image springs to mind of a Google aide shrugging off the carbon footprint of Harry’s journey (private jet and helicopter), but saying: “Uh, prince-dude, you need to lose the offensive shoes.”  Presumably the £16.5m eco-knees-up was at least partly enabled by Google’s ongoing tax avoidance, but let’s not spoil a beautiful moment with facts and stuff. A total of 114 private jets ferried the celebrities to Italy, releasing hundreds of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. As they arrived in Sicily, they transferred to Camp Google in luxury vehicles and/or helicopters. There followed what must surely have been intellectually invigorating A-list debates about how “we” (they mean us, not them) must conserve the Earth’s resources. After that, the celebrity activists retired to relax in their gratis £730-a-night-plus rooms, perchance haunted by the spectres of global eco-catastrophe and Coldplay agreeing to perform. Perhaps, like me, you’re thinking: “If only self-awareness could be solar-powered”? I mean, did anyone at Google realise how all this starry eco-activism might look to the outside world? The tiny disconnect between what Google and its guests were saying and what they were doing? Apparently not. However, and this is a serious question: how do people expect eco-celebs to get around? When they lend support, as Emma Thompson did for the recent Extinction Rebellion rally in London, they risk being roasted under the hot sun of public and media condemnation. Is this fair – presumably the publicity a celebrity generates justifies the carbon? Should the famous stick to local events and videolinks or just not bother? It’s not as if Harry could have micro-scooted to Sicily or descended in a hot-air balloon, like a woke, royal Phileas Fogg. Not that this excuses the gargantuan excess and repellent insincerity of Camp Google. (Note to Silicon Valley: if you want to throw grotesquely smug A-list beanos, spare us the ghastly faux-worthiness.) However, it’s worth asking if mocking the motivations-cum-emissions of eco-celebs is fast turning into a socially acceptable bloodsport. While A-list hypocrisy is always great fun, our own isn’t entirely without its amusements. British women with hideous, unsightly vaginas, rejoice – help is at hand! New York company VSPOT plans to open a “vaginal spa” in London’s Knightsbridge this autumn. Treatments could include vaginal steaming (I’ve always presumed this must be akin to crouching knickerless over a steaming kettle, but even better); “V-tightening” with a laser (a fun day out for all the family); and a mysterious herb-infused vagina “facial”. They do realise this isn’t where a lady’s face is, right? This is serious. Like labial surgery, popularised by pornography, it sends out the message that female genitals are unacceptable left alone and need to be prettified. That something very wrong is going on “down there” and should be fretted about and attended to. Never mind that medical people point out that the vagina is self-cleaning and doesn’t require such treatments. Also, that steaming might not only burn the vaginal walls, but alter the heathy balance of bacteria, leading to infections. Astonishing, isn’t it? Who’d have thought that going boil-in-the-bag with genitals would be a bad idea? Trust qualified gynaecologists to ruin a relaxing spa day. Another major alarm bell is that Gwyneth Paltrow appears to have no involvement in this company. Wasn’t Paltrow one of the intrepid pioneers of steaming vaginas? Didn’t she also champion inserting jade eggs until, again, some spoilsport gynaecologists said something about toxic shock syndrome and bacterial vaginosis? Sorry, but I can’t take anything in the arena of vagina maintenance seriously unless Gwynnie’s face is attached. She is our queen of down-below quackery and female genitalia spruce-ups. She should be alerted that someone is trying to steal her vaginal thunder. In the meantime, I’ll continue to feel thrilled that women are being encouraged to worry about the actual insides of their bodies. Next week: women, are you satisfied with the shape of your kidneys? Not to get all “judgey” on iron age women, but at least one was a lazy, sweet-munching fashion victim, say Swiss archaeologists. They discovered a hollowed-out, tree-trunk coffin in the Aussersihl district in Zurich bearing the body of a well-to-do Celtic woman, wearing fine clothes and jewellery, with indications that she had a sweet tooth and did little physical work. Could this be an ancestor of mine? There are eerie similarities, if you take away the upper-class bling, replace sweet with savoury and add “evidence” of entire weekends sprawled on the sofa watching boxsets of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars, with no movement visible to the naked eye. How did they get all this information from a 2,200-year-old corpse? And surely she could not have imagined that, in a couple of millennia, the world would be raising a censorious eyebrow over her amber necklaces and sweet-toothed indolence. Perhaps the trend will catch on and henceforth people will be buried judgmentally with their consumer detritus – mobile phones, KFC buckets and Amazon vouchers. “It’s what she would have wanted – I mean, seriously, she really did want that Accessorize bracelet.” Modern people are criticised for sedentary, over-indulgent lifestyles, but it would appear we are merely following tradition. • This article was amended on 5 August 2019 to omit a reference to Bono being at the Google event.

"Planting saplings has been proposed as part of a DIY solution to the climate crisis, for those of us who can’t approve legislation (about a trillion new trees should do it). So what direct action can be taken when councils lop down precious trees? That’s one of the questions posed by Parakeet, an eco-musical of small scale but with moments of mighty power, which finds a perfect home in Paines Plough’s intimate Roundabout venue. Written by Brigitte Aphrodite with music by Gaz Tomlinson, AKA Quiet Boy, it’s as colourful in its approach to complex material as their 2015 show about depression, My Beautiful Black Dog. Parakeet also asks how theatre can play a role in sustainability. And, in a show fizzing with youth, one other question stands out: if 16-year-olds can legally become company directors and have sex, why on earth can’t they vote?  Michelle Tiwo is immediately compelling as Girl, an otherwise unnamed teenager uprooted from London to Margate, where the landscapes show a “sky that can’t be denied”. As Girl struggles with coming out to her mother, and deals with her mum’s new geezer boyfriend, the only comfort she finds is in spotting the rose-ringed parakeets that appear as magically and mysteriously in Thanet as they do in the capital. One theory, posed in the show, is that they represent the spirit of Jimi Hendrix, who released a pair in London. (Others credit Shepperton Studios’ 1951 production of The African Queen with the south-east’s parakeet population.) When Girl meets Dust (Isabel Oliver), who was raised in Margate, and Tam (Lula Mebrahtu), an Eritrean refugee, the trio form a punk group. But these punks are about empathy as much as anarchy and they rally to save a tree that is home to nesting parakeets and due to be felled. The play’s exotic-bird metaphors stand out like the bright green hair of Aphrodite and Quiet Boy, who share the stage with the three actors. The parakeets are vilified, we’re told, for drowning out the voices of native British birds. This tale of fitting in and speaking up treads familiar ground and lacks depth of characterisation, but Laura Keefe’s production and Aphrodite’s script have an appealingly raggedy quality that matches punk’s DIY spirit. It also complements Alex Noble’s patchwork, birdlike costumes, made using materials sourced from a charity that collects unwanted clothing. And when these punks sing, the show soars with an energy you could only dream of harnessing. At the Roundabout, Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 25 August. Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews."

Chart: NOAA, public domain
In the heydays of global warming, in the early 2000s, scientists and activists loudly claimed hurricanes would become more frequent and even more powerful due to global warming supercharging – things would only get worse. And unless we changed our fossil-fuel indulgent lives, Mother Nature would certainly punish mankind like never before.
Odds: 1 in 2300!
Yet, since those hysterical days, hurricane activity over the East Coast has unexpectedly all but disappeared. Not a major hurricane (Cat 3 – 5) has hit the US east coast in close to 4000 days, thus making the period the quietest in recorded history. The whopping odds of this according to one estimate was only 1 in 2300. Read here and here.
Rare! Children see first east coast hurricane ever!
This means that almost all children under 14 have no or barely any recollection of a major hurricane hitting the US east coast.

For Florida, ABC News here reports that Hermine is the first hurricane of any category to hit the state in a decade.
In summary, the exact opposite of what climate experts predicted in 2005 has in fact happened. They could not have been more wrong. Hermine it turns out, just barely made hurricane status. ABC writes:
The Category 1 storm hit just east of St. Marks around 1:30 a.m. EDT with winds around 80 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Hermine later weakened to a tropical storm as it moved farther inland.”
The latest is that Hermine has weakened to a tropical storm and is located over Georgia. The track for the next hours is shown below.

Chart: NOAA
Though it’s early, the storm could pose a threat to southern New England.
Of course one calm 10-year period of hurricane activity does not mean it’s going to stay that way by any means. It’s just a question of time before hurricane activity naturally picks up again.

For California Weather…If It’s Bad

Image Source: Cook et al., 2010

In the present era of agenda-driven journalism, major news outlets often attempt to persuade readers that weather events occurring now have never happened before…and they are worsened by human-caused climate change.

In 2015, Humans Caused Drought, Too Little Rainfall In California

Global Warming Brought on California’s Severe Drought
Humans to Blame for Catastrophic Drought in California, Scientists Say
Study: Human-caused global warming behind Calif. drought
Long-suffering California can blame drought on global warming, experts say
“Scientists predict that “enhanced drought” will continue in California throughout this century because global warming has ‘substantially increased’ the likelihood of extreme droughts in the state.”

In 2017, Humans Causing Floods, Too Much Rainfall In California

Heavy California rains par for the course for climate change
With Climate Change, California Is Likely To See More Extreme Flooding
GLOBAL WARMING MEANS CALIFORNIA WILL SEE A LOT MORE ‘PINEAPPLE EXPRESS’ [RAIN]STORMS
Bill Nye Blames Global Warming For Devastating Floods In Northern Cali

Even the editor of the prominent scholarly journal Science has just claimed that the abundance of rainfall in California is now a trend brought on by human-caused climate change.  Since when is a 7-month precipitation record a trend?
Science (June 30, 2017) – Estimating economic damage from climate change
“Episodes of severe weather in the United States, such as the present abundance of rainfall in California, are brandished as tangible evidence of the future costs of current climate trends.”


Attempting to clarify how humans are simultaneously responsible for too much and too little rainfall, Michael Mann explains why warming causes more intense rainfall and widespread drought at the same time, and how this is ironic but not a contradiction.


“With warming, water is cycling more vigorously through our atmosphere. As it turns out, that implies more frequent, very heavy rainfall events, more intense weather potentially as a result of this amplified hydrological cycle. And ironically – although the atmosphere can hold more water vapor and can therefore produce larger amounts of rainfall in a given event – it turns out that these events become less frequent and the warmer surface also causes more evaporation of water into the atmosphere, drying soil surfaces, drying land surfaces. So in this warmer climate with an amplified hydrological cycle we actually see increased rainfall, intense rainfall flooding. But we can also see more widespread drought over continental regions. It might seem like a contradiction, but in fact both predictions follow from the intensification of the hydrological cycle.”


Long-Term Context Matters



It wasn’t all that long ago that journalists actually reported on climate change and weather events while considering a long-term context of natural variability rather than characterizing year-to-year weather change as unprecedented, the worst on record, and caused by humans.
 .
For example, in 1992 the New York Times actually published an article indicating Medieval-era droughts were much more severe than now, lasting hundreds of years.   The modern period has been “relatively wet” compared to the past in that region.



New York Times, 1992
“BEGINNING about 1,100 years ago, what is now California baked in two droughts, the first lasting 220 years and the second 140 years. Each was much more intense than the mere six-year dry spells that afflict modern California from time to time, new studies of past climates show. The findings suggest, in fact, that relatively wet periods like the 20th century have been the exception rather than the rule in California for at least the last 3,500 years, and that mega-droughts are likely to recur.”
“Dr. Scott Stine, a paleoclimatologist at California State University at Hayward, used radiocarbon dating techniques to determine the age of the trees’ outermost annual growth rings, thereby establishing the ends of drought periods. He then calculated the lengths of the preceding dry spells by counting the rings in each stump. This method identified droughts lasting from A.D. 892 to A.D. 1112 and from A.D. 1209 to A.D. 1350. Judging by how far the water levels dropped during these periods — as much as 50 feet in some cases — Dr. Stine concluded that the [Medieval-era] droughts were not only much longer, they were far more severe than either the drought of 1928 to 1934, California’s worst in modern times, or the more recent severe dry spell of 1987 to 1992.”

The Historical Southwest U.S. Climate: 3.2°C Warmer During Medieval Times

Millar et al., 2006
“The paleoclimate modeled for Whitewing [Sierra Nevada, CA] during the Medieval period was significantly warmer and slightly drier than present . Medieval mean annual minimum temperature was warmer than current by 3.2°C, with large differences in winter (+3.5°C, January) and summer (+4.0°C, July). Mean annual maximum temperature was also greater in the Medieval period (+2.3°C), with greater differences in winter (+3.2°C, January) than summer (+2.6°C, July). Annual precipitation was less by 24 mm.”

Scuderi, 1993
“Long-term trends in the temperature reconstruction are indicative of a 125-year periodicity that may be linked to solar activity as reflected in radiocarbon and auroral records. The results indicate that both the warm intervals during the Medieval Warm Epoch (A.D. 800 to 1200) and the cold intervals during the Little Ice Age (A.D. 1200 to 1900) are closely associated with the 125-year [solar activity] period.”


Medieval Drought Lasted Hundreds Of Years And Was Much More Severe

Whitehouse et al., 2010
“Paleoclimatic and model data indicate increased temperatures in western North America [∼AD 900–1300] of approximately 1 °C over the long-term mean. This was a period of extensive and persistent aridity over western North America. Paleoclimatic evidence suggests drought in the mid-12th century far exceeded the severity, duration, and extent of subsequent droughts.”


Kirby et al., 2014


Cook et al., 2010

Scientists: Natural Variability Dominates In Southwestern U.S. Drought

Cheng et al., 2016
“The current California drought has cast a heavy burden on statewide agriculture and water resources, further exacerbated by concurrent extreme high temperatures. Furthermore, industrial-era global radiative forcing brings into question the role of long-term climate change on CA drought. How has human-induced climate change affected California drought risk?  … The results thus indicate the net effect of climate change has made agricultural drought less likely, and that the current severe impacts of drought on California’s agriculture has not been substantially caused by long-term climate changes.”

Prein et al., 2016
“Projected changes of a poleward extension of the subtropical dry zones simulated by climate models and the corresponding decrease of precipitation in the U.S. Southwest have not been found in observations to date because of the large natural climate variability.”

Seager et al., 2015
“The causes of the California drought during November to April winters of 2011/12 to 2013/14 are analyzed using observations and ensemble simulations with seven atmosphere models forced by observed SSTs. …[T]he precipitation deficit during the drought was dominated by natural variability, a conclusion framed by discussion of differences between observed and modeled tropical SST trends.”

Diaz and Wahl, 2015
“An analysis of the October 2013–September 2014 precipitation in the western United States and in particular over the California–Nevada region suggests this anomalously dry season, while extreme, is not unprecedented in comparison with the approximately 120-yr-long instrumental record of water year (WY; October–September) totals and in comparison with a 407-yr WY precipitation reconstruction dating back to 1571. Over this longer period, nine other years are known or estimated to have been nearly as dry or drier than WY 2014. The 3-yr deficit for WYs 2012–14, which in California exceeded the annual mean precipitation, is more extreme but also not unprecedented, occurring three other times over the past approximate 440 years in the reconstruction.”

Scientists: Natural Variability Dominates In Continental U.S. Drought

Seager et al., 2009   (Southeastern U.S.)
“Tree-ring records show that the twentieth century has been moist from the perspective of the last millennium and free of long and severe droughts that were abundant in previous centuries.  The recent drought, forced by reduced precipitation and with reduced evaporation, has no signature of model-projected anthropogenic climate change.”
Stambaugh et al., 2011 (Midwestern U.S.)
“[D]rought conditions over the period of instrumental records (since 1895) do not exhibit the full range of variability, severity, or duration of droughts during the last millennium.  Thirteen decadal to multidecadal droughts (i.e., ≥10 years) occurred during the last millennium – the longest lasting sixty-one years and centered on the late twelfth century.”
Andreadis and Lettenmaier, 2006 (Continental U.S.)
“Droughts have, for the most part, become shorter, less frequent, and cover a smaller portion of the country over the last century.”

Scientists: Natural Variability Dominates In Global-Scale Drought

Cook et al., 2015
“Megadroughts reconstructed over north-central Europe in the 11th and mid-15th centuries reinforce other evidence from North America and Asia that droughts were more severe, extensive, and prolonged over Northern Hemisphere land areas before the 20th century, with an inadequate understanding of their causes.”

Hoerling et al., 2010 
“In this study, the nature and causes for observed regional precipitation trends during 1977–2006 are diagnosed. It is found that major features of regional trends in annual precipitation during 1977–2006 are consistent with an atmospheric response to observed sea surface temperature (SST) variability. This includes drying over the eastern Pacific Ocean that extends into western portions of the Americas related to a cooling of eastern Pacific SSTs, and broad increases in rainfall over the tropical Eastern Hemisphere, including a Sahelian rainfall recovery and increased wetness over the Indo–West Pacific related to North Atlantic and Indo–West Pacific ocean warming. It is further determined that these relationships between SST and rainfall change are generally not symptomatic of human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols.”

Sheffield et al., 2012
Little change in global drought over the past 60 years
“Here we show that the previously reported increase in global drought is overestimated because the PDSI uses a simplified model of potential evaporation that responds only to changes in temperature and thus responds incorrectly to global warming in recent decades. More realistic calculations, based on the underlying physical principles that take into account changes in available energy, humidity and wind speed, suggest that there has been little change in drought over the past 60 years.”

Cai et al., 2014
“Recent drought in 1993–2008 was still within the frame of natural climate variability based on the 306 yr PDSI reconstruction.    The dry and wet phases of Lingkong Mountain were in accordance with changes in the summer Asian-Pacific oscillation and sunspot numbers, they also showed strong similarity to other tree-ring based moisture indexes in large areas in and around the CLP, indicating the moisture variability in the CLP [Chinese Loess Plateau] was almost synchronous and closely related with large-scale land–ocean–atmospheric circulation and solar activity.”

McCabe and Wolock, 2015
“Monthly precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) from the CRUTS3.1 data set are used to compute monthly P minus PET (PMPE) for the land areas of the globe. The percent of the global land area with annual sums of PMPE less than zero are used as an index of global drought (%drought) for 1901 through 2009. Results indicate that for the past century %drought has not changed, even though global PET and temperature (T) have increased.”

Roderick and Farquhar, 2004
“Contrary to expectations, measurements of pan evaporation show decreases in many parts of the Northern Hemisphere over the last 50 years. When combined with rainfall measurements, these data show that much of the Northern Hemisphere’s terrestrial surface has become less arid over the last 50 years. However, whether the decrease in pan evaporation is a phenomenon limited to the Northern Hemisphere has until now been unknown because there have been no reports from the Southern Hemisphere. Here, we report a decrease in pan evaporation rate over the last 30 years across Australia of the same magnitude as the Northern Hemisphere trends (approximately −4 mm a−2). The results show that the terrestrial surface in Australia has, on average, become less arid over the recent past, just like much of the Northern Hemisphere.”

IPCC, 2007 (AR4):
“Warming the troposphere enhances the cooling rate, thereby increasing precipitation, but this may be partly offset by a decrease in the efficiency of radiative cooling due to an increase in atmospheric CO2 (Allen and Ingram, 2002; Yang et al., 2003; Lambert et al., 2004; Sugi and Yoshimura, 2004). This suggests that global mean precipitation should respond more to changes in shortwave forcing than CO2 forcing, since shortwave forcings, such as volcanic aerosol, alter the temperature of the troposphere without affecting the efficiency of radiative cooling. This is consistent with a simulated decrease in precipitation following large volcanic eruptions [which cause cooling] (Robock and Liu, 1994; Broccoli et al., 2003), and may explain why anthropogenic influence has not been detected in measurements of global land mean precipitation (Ziegler et al., 2003; Gillett et al., 2004b), although Lambert et al. (2004) urge caution in applying the energy budget argument to land-only data.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterNormally even the German conservative media have been supportive of Germany’s shift from fossil fuels over to green energies, and most leading conservative media outlets accept that climate change is mostly man-made and thus needs to be taken seriously.
Climate science skepticism is scorned in Germany.
So it’s all the more surprising that one of Germany’s leading center-right dailies, Die Welt, came out with an article seriously challenging Germany’s Energiewende (transition to green energies).
Citing a 20-page report by McKinsey, Die Welt writes that the Energiewende risks becoming “an economic disaster” (it in fact already has) and that the opinions on the Energiewende by McKinsey are totally opposite of those held by the German government. This shows two things: the growing chasm between the German government’s view and reality, and 2) the government’s stubborn refusal to acknowledge that their energy policy has become a dismal failure.
According to Die Welt, a team of McKinsey experts examined 15 criteria and concluded: “The costs will continue to rise“, and thus contradict the German government’s claim of “stable prices”.
In fact 11 of the 15 criteria that were examined had worsened. According to the report:
The current figures available show that the previous success of the Energiewende for the most part has come from expensive subsidies. At the same time goals whose fulfilment do not depend on direct financial support are becoming increasingly more unrealistic.”
Die Welt writes that McKinsey’s conclusion “must be really painful for the government“, which had hoped to see reductions in CO2 emissions. The bitter reality is that CO2 emissions have in fact risen over the past years and today they are more than 13% over the original target.
Green jobs eroding
The Energiewende has also failed on the jobs creation front, Die Welt writes. Proponents claimed earlier that renewable energies would lead to a jobs boom. But that too has not materialized in any way, shape or form. Jobs in the sector have fallen “for the 4th year in a row – falling from 355,400 to 330,000“. The leading German national daily adds that the biggest job losses came from the onshore wind and solar sectors where 15,000 jobs were lost.
McKinsey warns that the number employed in green energy could even fall below 2008 levels!

And not only “green energy” jobs are being slashed. McKinsey also found that for the first time in 2016 jobs in energy-intensive industries were lost. Die Welt reports:
In March 2016 there were in total 15,000 jobs less than a half year earlier.”
Cost of electricity production to jump 40%
The total cost of producing electricity for the country has also surged due to the Energiewende, McKinsey writes:
The cost of supplying electricity in Germany will rise from 63 billion euros today to 77 billion euros annually by 2015. In 2010 the cost was 55 billion euros.”
This means much higher prices for consumers, who have seen their electricity prices rise to 30.38 euro-cents per kilowatt-hour. For the average German household this will translate into 335 euros of more costs every year by 2025.
Meanwhile the average European electricity price has dropped.
47.3 percent more expensive than average European power
Currently German electricity prices are on average almost 3 times more than what consumers in the USA pay.
The McKinsey report found:
In the meantime the price level for German household power is 47.3 percent above the European average.“

Share this...FacebookTwitterContrary to what is often claimed, Arctic sea ice is not in a death spiral, and has been stable for the past 10 years.
Yesterday Japanese skeptic blogger Kirye informed at Twitter that the sea ice volume and area rates of growth for September and early October this year are astonishingly rapid and at a pace we are accustomed to seeing in late October and November:
Chart: DMI
Volume is now well near normal level at over 9000 cubic kilometers. Sea ice area can be seen here.
Although Arctic sea ice reached a rather low level this year, September’s rate of volume growth was nothing less than spectacular, skyrocketing from some 6000 cubic kilometers to a bit over 9000 cubic kilometers in just a matter of three weeks! The impressive rate of growth is shown graphically by the next chart:

As shown the recent rate of growth is something that we commonly see in late October and in November. Usually the rate of growth is only about half as much.
Using the global warming theory on Arctic sea ice extent, i.e. it’s due to temperature, this year’s impressive growth would tell us that the Arctic must have been unusually frigid over the past three weeks. But looking at the Arctic temperature above 80°N latitude here, we see that temperatures have in fact been well above average. So what’s going on?
How can ice be forming so rapidly when it’s been mild over the past few weeks? What can we deduce from all this?
It tells us that Arctic sea ice extent has a lot more to do with other factors other than surface temperature. Critical factors include, ocean currents and cycles, wind conditions from weather patterns, and so on. So the next time an alarmist tries to tell us that sea ice loss is proof of warming, then just point out that there’s a lot more to it than just surface temperature. This year shows that in a very profound way.
The system is far more complex than just a trace gas (one, by the way, that happens to be a convenient vehicle to mass regulation).

In the early 1950s, the accepted scientific truth — as determined by thermometer records available at the time — was that global mean temperatures had risen by 0.7°C between 1860 and 1940.
 

Willett, H. C. 1950. “Temperature Trends of the Past Century” Centenary Proc. Royal Meteorol. Soc., pp. 195-206.

As recently as 1980, it was still considered “consensus” science that the Northern Hemisphere had warmed by “nearly 1.0°C”  between 1880 and 1940, and then cooled by a “nearly comparable” amount from 1940 to the late 1970s.

Agee, 1980


The Temperature ‘Truth’ Changes After The 1980s

The raw thermometer or instrumental temperature data available in the 1950s have not changed in the last 35 years.  In other words, daily high and low temperature numbers from thermometer accounts that were not available in the 1870s or 1910s or 1930s did not subsequently become available, or appear, in the years following the early 1980s.  And yet after the 1980s, the thermometric instrumental record accepted during the 1950s to 1970s was fundamentally changed to reflect a new truth that aligned with climate models.  For instead of a global warming +0.7°C between 1860 and 1940, the Met Office decided that the 1860-1940 warming trend should be +0.3°C instead.  Again, no new raw thermometric evidence had emerged.  And yet about 0.4°C of warming was lopped off the previously accepted trend anyway.

New Paper’s Ice Core Evidence Indicates Globe Was Similarly Warm In 1920s, 1930s

Interestingly, when graphs of regional temperatures using geophysical proxy evidence (ice cores, tree rings, etc.) are reconstructed for the last few centuries or millennia, the results look rather different than the current instrumental records do.  Instead of a sharp warming trajectory after the 1950s, for example, many regions do not show a significant warming trend at all.  In fact, more and more, temperature reconstructions using proxy evidence indicate that there has been no unusual or remarkable warming trend in recent decades that strongly aligns with the abrupt increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions after the 1940s.
To illustrate, consider the 60 papers published in 2016 (or the 17 papers already published in 2017) that display no clear evidence of an unusual warming trend after the 1940s — or in the last 100+ years relative to the last few thousand.  Instead, many reconstructions of regional temperatures using proxy evidence show that a large portion of modern era warming occurred prior to the 1940s, and not after it.
For example, consider the glacier melt rate in the 1920s to 1950s relative to recent decades in Gregory et al. (2013) below.  Could this explosive glacier melt rate have occurred with only modest warming as depicted in the highly altered instrumental record?

Gregory et al., 2013


Now, in a new paper, Steiger et al. (2017) have constructed graphs using compilations of ice core proxies to represent the globe.  As might be expected, there are notable differences in the reconstructions of global temperature using geophysical evidence when compared to the instrumental thermometer record (Berkley Earth).  Namely, (a) the instrumental record warms up the post-1970s period substantially relative to the ice core record (which shows an incompatible non-trend or cooling after the 1990s), and (b) the ice core record shows much more warming than the instrumental record does in the early 20th century.
In the graphs below, the instrumental (black) and isotope record (blue) appear together (as they do in the paper), and then the instrumental trend is removed in the subsequent representation.

Steiger et al., 2017
“Through several idealized and real proxy experiments we assess the spatial and temporal extent to which isotope records can reconstruct surface temperature, 500 hPa geopotential height, and precipitation. We find local reconstruction skill to be most robust across the reconstructions, particularly for temperature and geopotential height, as well as limited non-local skill in the tropics.  These results are in agreement with long-held views that isotopes in ice cores have clear value as local climate proxies, particularly for temperature and atmospheric circulation.”



 


Temperature ‘Truth’ Pivots Upon One’s Presuppositions, Biases

Convinced we have already obtained the truth about global temperatures, the Steiger et al. (2017) scientists possess the certitude to encapsulate that very word in their graph keys:



Considering scientists 30 years ago were documenting an artificial (urbanization) warming bias of more than 0.1°C per decade already existed in the post-1970s instrumental records, that 1/3rd of the oceans hadn’t even been sampled (temperatures) yet as of the 1990s, or that overseers of temperature datasets acknowledged that they just “made up” temperatures in places where there was no data,  can we really know the Earth’s true temperature?

Take a locality like Greenland.  When we consider that just a tiny fraction of the Greenland ice sheet has instrumental temperature readings available for both recent decades and for the beginning of the 20th century (see illustration below), just how certain can we be that we have the truth anyway?

Peterson and Vose, 1997


Or consider the below graphic of competing early 20th century temperature trends for Greenland.  Reeves Eyre and Zeng (2017) indicate modeling biases may reach 5°C for Greenland, and they point out that widespread temperature monitoring has only been available since the 1990s.
Of the spaghetti of trends depicted in the graph below, which one is the truth?  For those who believe the warming in recent decades is dangerously unprecedented, the lower early 20th century temperature trends are truth.  For those skeptical that the modern climate is unusually warm or that the Earth’s climate undulates in concert with CO2 emissions, the truth is likely that the 1920s and 1930s had warmer temperatures.  Which conceptualization is the “right” one?  Probably neither.

Reeves Eyre and Zeng, 2017
“Ice sheet-average annual mean SAT [surface air temperatures] from different datasets are highly correlated in recent decades, but their 1901–2000 trends differ even in sign [some show cooling, some show warming]. Compared with the MERRA2 climatology combined with gridded SAT analysis anomalies, thirty-one earth system model historical runs from the CMIP5 archive reach ~5°C for the 1901–2000 average bias and have opposite trends for a number of sub-periods. … Due to its remoteness and extreme climate however, continuous widespread climate monitoring over the GrIS has been carried out for only about the last two decades, and even then with rather sparse coverage in some geographic areas and glaciological regimes. … Box (2002) found a pattern of warming from ~1900 to ~1940, cooling from ~1940 to ~1990, and warming from ~1990 onwards. In addition, inter-annual variability was found to be closely related to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). …Biases vary by season and by region of the ice sheet: in the ablation region (demarcated here by the 1500 m elevation contour) during summer, most reanalyses have a ~1°C positive bias (though 20CR and ERA–20C have negative biases) while CRU and Berkeley Earth gridded SAT analyses have larger positive biases.”

 

Before It Was Ignored, The Scientific ‘Consensus’ Was That Explosive Warming Occurred Prior To The 1940s

At the time, there wasn’t any disagreement among geologists.  The late 19th century to early 1940s was considered a period of unprecedented warming.  The highest temperatures on record.
The Arctic winter warmed by 7.7°C.  Antarctica warmed by nearly 3°C.  Sea levels rose at a clip of 8 mm/yr in the Atlantic.  Glaciers melted “catastrophically”. Dozens of animal species migrated north to escape the warmth.  Crops could be grown in regions where they hadn’t before.
At the time, this was the climate truth.   Below is a summary of accepted climatic trends as they existed in 1959, compiled by Princeton geologist Dr. Erling Dorf.

Dorf, 1959:  “CLIMATIC CHANGES OF THE PAST AND PRESENT”

•A 14°F (+7.7°C) winter mean warming in the Arctic (North Pole region) between the early 1900s and 1950, with ice-free ports 7 months out of the year rather than the mere 3 months per year that were common at the turn of the century.
“It has been observed, however, that the greatest temperature increases during the last hundred years have been in the Arctic regions. In Spitsbergen, only about 10 to 12 degrees from the North Pole, the mean winter temperatures have risen about 14° F. since 1910 (Willett, 1950). Ice-free ports there are now open to navigation about 7 months of the year as compared with only 3 months fifty years ago (Ahlmann, 1953, p. 32). If the warming trend of the north polar region should continue at its present rate, it has been estimated that the entire Arctic Ocean would be navigable all year long within about a hundred years.”
•A 5°F (+2.8°C) warming in Antarctica since the early 1900s.
“At the opposite end of the world, according to recent reports from the Weather Bureau (Wexler, 1958), the Antarctic region has undergone a rise of about 5°F. in average temperature in the last fifty years.”
•“Catastrophic” and “violent” wasting away of glaciers since 1900, with Muir Glacier retreating 2 miles (3.2 km) in 10 years.  The retreat began in the 1700s, with severe wasting between the 1920s and 1940s.
“What have been some of the notable results of this warming trend during the last hundred years? Glaciers throughout the world have been melting away at a rapidly increasing rate. Brooks (1949, p. 24). the eminent British paleoclimatologist, stated that “Since the beginning of the 20th Century glaciers have been wasting away rapidly, or even catastrophically.” In the Juneau region of Alaska, all but one of the numerous glaciers began melting away as far back as 1765. Muir Glacier, for example, has retreated as much as two miles in 10 years. Baird and Sharp (1954, p. 143) have referred to the “alarming retreat of glaciers” in the Alaskan region; along the Pacific Coast of North America and in Europe they believe the glacial melting “appears to be progressing violently.”   In only a few regions of the world, such as the Pacific Northwest, are there any records of glaciers advancing during the past century, and these have been mostly since 1950 (Hubley, 1956).”


Ahlmann, 1953
•Due especially to the massive glacier-melting during the 1920s to 1940s, there was as much as a 6-inch (15 cm) rise in sea level between 1930 and 1948, a rate of about 32 inches (+80 cm) per century, or 8 mm per year, which is 5 times the overall rate of rise for the entire 1901-2010 period (1.7 mm/yr) according to the IPCC (2013) and a “six-fold” increase relative to the 19th century rate.
“Believed in large part to be the result of the melting of the world’s glaciers, sea level has been rising at a rapidly increasing rate, amounting to as much as a 6-inch rise from 1930 to 1948 (Marmar, 1948). This is about four times the average rate of sea level rise during the past 9000 years [~2 mm/yr], as recorded by Shepard and Suess (1956). It should be noted that more than a six-fold increase in the rate of sea level rise occurred in the mid-1920’s at the same time there was a striking change in the rate of glacial melting in the north (Ahlmann, 1953, Fig. 11).”

•Agricultural crop lines shifted 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) northward, with 10-day longer growing seasons.  Tree lines moved 65 feet (20 meters) up the mountains in Sweden.
“Changes in vegetation brought about by the warmer temperatures include the encroachment of trees into the subpolar tundra as recorded in Alaska, Quebec, Laborador, and Siberia. In the Canadian prairies the agricultural crop line has shifted from 50 to 100 miles northward as a result of the lengthening of the growing season by as much as ten days. In parts of northern New England and eastern Canada the birch trees have been dying off over large areas, and the spruces and balsams have begun to suffer as a result of the rise in summer temperatures. In Sweden the timberline has moved up the mountain slopes as much as 65 feet since 1930 (Ahlmann, 1953, p. 35).”
•Many birds and mammals extended their habitats northwards; about 25 species of birds advanced from the south up into a warmer   Greenland; codfish replaced seals along the coasts of Greenland, which led “Greenland Eskimos” to switch to cod-fishing rather than seal-hunting.
“In the animal world many southern types of both birds and mammals have been extending their habitat ranges northward as a result of the warming trend. The cardinal, the turkey vulture, the tufted titmouse, and the blue-winged warbler, as well as the warmth-loving opossum, have slowly moved their ranges into the northern United States. A good many central European species of animals have been shifting their ranges northward into Scandinavia, Greenland, Iceland, and the Faero Islands. Twenty-five species of birds alone are reported to have invaded Greenland from the south since 1918 (Jensen and Fristrup, 1950). Codfish from the Atlantic have replaced the seals in the waters along the coast of Greenland. It is reported that compared to a shipment of 5 tons of codfish from Greenland in 1913, the 1946 shipment had risen to over 13,000 tons; the Greenland Eskimos have become cod fishermen instead of seal fishermen (Kimble, 1950). Farther south tunafish have moved northward into the waters off New England, and tropical flying fishes have become increasingly common off the coast of New Jersey.”

The ‘Truth’ About Past Climates…Is What We Want It To Be


But the truth about the climate as it existed in the 1950s is no longer accepted or acceptable.  And that version of the truth is to be ignored.  Why?  Because if we accept that dramatic and rapid warming (and glacier melt and sea level rise) could occur while anthropogenic CO2 emissions were flat and rather negligible (prior to the 1940s), then we would have to acknowledge that modern climate changes may not be predominantly influenced by human activity.  And that couldn’t be the truth.  So . . . it isn’t.
And 2016 was the Earth’s hottest year on record.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClaims that the earth is rapidly heating up because of man-made CO2 and thus heading for a “climate catastrophe” have taken a serious body blow over the past three years as a huge and fresh body of science emerges.

More than 1000 peer-reviewed papers published over the last 3 years expose climate alarmism as fake science.
1000 papers in three years
Yesterday Kenneth Richard published his list of 500 climate catastrophe skeptic papers appearing in scientific journals in 2016 alone. It is the latest addition to the 282 papers published in 2015, and the 248 papers published in 2014, bringing the total number of peer-reviewed papers published over the past three years to more than 1000.
As a result the once many dramatic hockey-stick shaped curves put out by some climate scientists over the past two decades showing the earth is headed for disaster have been exposed as fake science, which of course had spawned some 20 years of nonstop fake news – much of it designed to spread panic among the population.
Needlessly hyped
According to Richard, the vast collection of fresh papers show that natural factors play a much larger if not a dominant role when it comes to climate change. The expected global warming has been needlessly hyped, experts are now saying.
Puts IPCC to shame
Harvard astrophysicist Dr. Willie Soon thinks the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has strayed way off track. “I’m not surprised by the large number or empirical evidence that rejects the CO2 dangerous global warming alarmism,” wrote Soon in an e-mail. “This sort of literature review ought to put the sort of biased, if not anti-science, reports by the UN IPCC to shame.”

Dr. Soon has long been a sharp critic of the mainstream institutionalized climate science. He added: “It is high time for the wider public to not only bear witness to the unbalance and corruption of our science institutions, but also to demand answers on why there has been such a disregard for truth and fact.”
Climate well within natural variability
Many among the 1000 peer-reviewed scholarly papers show that extreme weather events are in fact NOT increasing in any unusual manner, that they were also common in the past, and that today they are still well within the range of natural variability.
Other papers show that biodiversity is not under any serious threat. Hundreds of other papers have found that solar activity and oceanic cycles are in fact the driving factors behind climate change. In short the latest fresh batch of scientific literature is telling us that all the past alarmism likely has been needlessly shrill and that it’s time to take a step back and to seriously refocus.
Although most of the papers listed by Richard do not refute global warming and that man plays a role – they do cast undeniable doubt over the cause of the warming, especially the warming over the past 35 years. The recent literature clearly shows that natural factors indeed play a major role, and CO2 much less so.
Climate science a UN charade
Not mincing any words, Canadian climatologist Dr. Tim Ball feels that global warming became a charade years ago and that it has gone on too long.
He offers an even harsher assessment of the UN climate science, writing that the IPCC is made up of “bureaucrats” who harbor a political agenda. “Extreme bias of climate research was deliberately created through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to prove rather than disprove the hypothesis that human CO2 was causing runaway global warming,” he wrote to NTZ in an email.  “The political message and funding were directed to only research that proved their hypothesis. Only journals that favored the objective were used and encouraged, so the preponderance of research and publications supported the predetermined message. It is a classic case of Lysenkoism”
Dr. Ball authored the climate science critical book: Human Caused Global warming – The Biggest Deception in History.

"How do you write a eulogy for a glacier? Think about it. How would you go about that, having grown up with glaciers as a geological given, a symbol of eternity? How do you say goodbye? When academics at Rice University in Houston, Texas called and asked me to write the text for a plaque to commemorate the first dead glacier in Iceland, I found myself confronted with this problem. I was reminded of one of my favourite passages from Kurt Vonnegut in Slaughterhouse-Five: “You know what I say to people when I hear they’re writing anti-war books?” “No. What do you say, Harrison Starr?” “I say, ‘Why don’t you write an anti-glacier book instead?’” What he meant, of course, was that there would always be wars, that they were as easy to stop as glaciers. I believe that too. Well guess what, Harrison Starr. We humans have done for the glaciers. Almost every glacier on the planet has stopped growing and most are shrinking at an alarming rate. Ok Glacier is the first in Iceland to be formally declared dead ice. In the Himalayas, Greenland, the Alps and Iceland, the glaciers are all melting. In the spirit of Vonnegut, you could say that the Texan professors had asked me to write a pro-glacier text. The name of our dead glacier has multiple layers. Ok in Icelandic is the equivalent of “yoke” in English, the pole traditionally used to carry buckets of water. Yoke can also mean burden, something that weighs you down. Ok carried water in the form of ice. And now that water has become ocean, the slowly rising burden of future generations. According to current trends, all glaciers in Iceland will disappear in the next 200 years. So the plaque for Ok could be the first of 400 in Iceland alone. The glacier Snæfellsjökull, where Jules Verne began his Journey to the Centre of the Earth, is likely to be gone in the next 30 years and that will be a significant loss. This glacier is for Iceland what Fuji is for Japan. The combined disappearance of all the glaciers of Iceland will add about 1cm to global sea levels. It might not seem much, but when that process is replicated worldwide, the floods will affect hundreds of millions of people. The most worrying prospect of all is the melting of the Himalayan glaciers. They are the yoke that carries the water for one billion people. My family has a personal connection to glaciers. My grandparents were founding partners of the Icelandic glacial research society. When my grandfather said he wanted to take my grandmother with him on a three-week research trip in 1955, some men asked him if he was crazy. Take a woman on a glacier trip? My grandparents and the research team mapped and measured the glacier and were stuck in a small tent for three days. “Weren’t you cold?” I asked them. “Cold? We were just married,” they replied. The part of the glacier where they pitched their tent had no name at the time. Today it is called Brúðarbunga, “The Bride’s Bulge”. For now, about 10% of Iceland is covered with glaciers. The thickest packs are in Vatnajökull – up to 1,000 metres deep. Imagine stacking three Empire State Buildings on top of each other – then stretch that bulk over the horizon. To think that something so huge is actually fragile is beyond comprehension. When my grandparents measured the glaciers, they were the eternal white giants. But calculate how long they will last in this warming climate and the outlook is bleak, to say the least. Most of them will only last the lifespan of someone born today who lives to a good age. We understand that glaciers grow and recede, but this is a collapse, an explosion in slow motion. It’s not that we aren’t used to changes in nature: we have mountains in Iceland younger than myself, huge craters that are younger than the Brooklyn Bridge. We have volcanic eruptions so violent and powerful that they seem to render all human action puny by comparison. What do we humans matter, people ask, when a volcano might blow and spew out millions of tonnes of CO2? In 2010 the famous Eyjafjallajökull eruption closed down all airports in Europe. But its CO2 emissions were only about 150,000 tonnes a day, compared with human activity which is responsible for almost 100m tonnes a day. The impact of humans on a daily basis is equal to more than 600 of these volcanoes. Imagine all these eruptions on every continent, all day, all night, all year round and tell yourself that they have no effect on the climate. The natural world is being transformed at an alarming rate. The frozen graves of mammoths in Siberia are thawing and the rate of ocean acidification is reaching levels not seen for 50m years. A dying glacier is not a dramatic event. The drama of a melting glacier is no more dramatic than springtime: one day there is snow and the next day it is gone. We are living through the Great Thaw, the Big Melt. We have to remind ourselves that this is not normal. That it is not OK to write a memorial to a glacier named Ok. We remind ourselves with a plaque that we resemble the frogs which are slowly boiled alive in the fable. Fellow frogs, we are cooking: what are we going to do about it? One of the fundamental flaws of our civilisation is its inability to think outside the present. When a scientist talks about 2100, we feel the date has nothing to do with us. So sometimes when I talk to university students I ask them to do a simple calculation, a thought experiment. I tell them, if you were born in the year 2000 you might become a healthy 90-year-old. At that time you might have a favourite 20-year-old in your life. A grandchild perhaps, someone you have known and loved for 20 years. When will that person be a healthy 90-year-old, maybe talking about you as the greatest influence in their lives? The students do the maths and come up with a year like 2160. That is not an abstract calculation. That is the intimate time of someone in high school or at university today. This is time whose meaning they can touch with their bare hands. If we can connect deeply to a date like this, what do we think of scientists warning of catastrophe in 2070? Or 2090? How can that be beyond our imagination, as if part of some sci-fi future? So on the copper plate to commemorate Ok glacier, we have written to these loved ones of the future: “We know what is happening and what needs to be done. Only you know if we did it.” • Andri Snær Magnason is the Icelandic author of LoveStar, The Casket of Time and The Story of the Blue Planet"
"Last week, as Paris faced down its hottest day since records began, the city authorities declared their readiness. Since the notorious heatwave of 2003 that killed thousands across France, the capital has put in place a heat strategy: cooling areas, a checking system for vulnerable people, shady parks kept open all night. Could these strategies actually work against a predicted record temperature of 42C (107.6F)? A study released this week shows that the world has never warmed faster than now. By 2050, the average temperature in the hottest month in Paris will rise by six degrees. This heatwave might be the new normal. I take my dog for a quick morning walk before the pavement becomes too hot for his paws Now that the heat has eased across Europe, it seems like time for some cool reflection on how effective the official advice actually was. Here’s what happened when I followed it. Temperature outside: 29CStrategy: shutter your house, spend three hours at low temperature I wake in a sweat, having managed some fitful sleep with the help of a fan during one of the hottest nights in Paris history. Now it’s time to try to keep my tiny, 100-year-old house as cool as possible. Following the advice of the health department, I close all the shutters. Then I take my fluffy dog for a quick morning walk before the pavement becomes too hot for his paws. It’s pretty hot outside now, but nothing out of the ordinary: I’m mostly cranky and tired from the high temperatures overnight. Back home, the dog gets a big bowl of cold water, and I get ready for my day. According to the Paris heatwave plan, I have a plan to spend three hours at low temperatures to avoid adverse health consequences, and I’m prepared with other recommendations of the French health department: I’ve made a personal extreme-heat pack with a spray bottle to mist myself with water, a handheld thermometer and a large bottle of water. I’m ready. Temperature outside: 34CStrategy: spend time in air conditioning The temperature outside my front door has improbably climbed by five degrees in the last hour alone. The city is already uncomfortable: the narrow pavements and heavy traffic make it feel even hotter than 34C. There’s nowhere to hide from the exhaust fumes and the already fierce sun. The official advice is to find air conditioning, so I walk to a nearby hotel. I’m already sweating when I arrive, but as soon as I step into reception my body temperature plunges uncomfortably. I’m also supposed to “eat in sufficient quantities”, which I’m interpreting to mean a buffet spread designed for hungry tourists and involving a lot of cheese. I look around at all the guests. They all passed a blissful night sleeping in 18C. They look refreshed, at ease, unflustered. One woman is wearing a scarf. I hate them. Temperature: 38CStrategy: use the Extrema app to seek out ‘cool islands’; avoid too much walking If 34C was uncomfortable, 38C is nasty. As the heat rises from the bitumen, I fire up the city’s dedicated heatwave app, Extrema, which identifies 922 “islands of cool”. The first place it recommends is a library: presumably air-conditioned, unfortunately closed. The next suggestion is a nearby church, the Église Saint-Germain-de-Charonne, which is deliciously cool – but a small mass is being held, and I feel like an intruder, so I pop out to the adjoining cemetery. Here, the heat radiates off the polished gravestones in waves: it’s worse than the street. I drink from a fountain, but the water comes out piping hot. I had heard there was a water mister nearby, so I set out to find it, but fail. Extrema confirms it was only installed for two days. Tramping around has driven my body temperature straight back up. The health department’s advice is to avoid physical exertion, such as walking long distances. I take the bus to a park. Temperature: 41CStrategy: use a heat map to find green spaces I’ve made a huge mistake. The bus is stifling, airless. My handheld thermometer has maxed out at 43C. I see pedestrians in the burning sunlight and I am jealous of them. There’s an eerie hush as small family groups take refuge in the shade Much of the transport system in Paris can be rendered unusable during heatwaves, with metro lines also regularly reaching dangerous temperatures. But 65% of Parisians do not own a car and have little option other than to endure it. I start to regret every decision I have made in life that led me to this bus. Collapsing out at the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, I expect some relief, but temperatures outside have now officially broken the previous record, from 1947, of 40.4C. The Buttes-Chaumont is one of the city’s largest parks, with waterfalls, sloping lawns and shady grottoes. Since 2015, it has been open 24 hours a day in summer. Over half of it is covered with more than 100 enormous old trees, making it one of the coolest places in Paris, according to the heat map. But 41C is 41C. There’s an eerie hush as small family groups and the odd shirtless or bikini-clad individual take refuge in the shade. Temperature: 42CStrategy: use town hall ‘refreshment rooms’; check in on loved ones After the 2003 heatwave, Paris set up the Chalex service, which allows vulnerable people to receive telephone check-ups during extreme heat. The worst sufferers can be brought to a refreshment room at their local town hall. In the 19th arrondissement, that’s an air-conditioned meeting room: it’s cool enough inside, but the portable air-conditioner is beginning to struggle against 42C. Emerging again into the blasting heat, I follow another of the health department’s rules: check in on your loved ones. In my case, that means texting my partner to ask how the dog is doing. The dog is lying in front of a fan, his fur gently ruffling. The dog is doing much better than me. I’m still radiating heat, primarily it seems from my face. But I’m also lucky that my loved ones are a young man and a resilient street dog. Elderly relatives, or people with reduced mobility who can’t necessarily make it to cooler spaces on their own, need human connection even more urgently in heat crises. Temperature: 42CAdvice: help the vulnerable In any city, heatwaves are hardest for those who lack shelter. For the hottest part of the day, I join a walking group of city officials and volunteers seeking out women who are living on the streets. The group provides hygiene kits and offers to take the women to cooler spaces. Leading the charge is Dominique Versini, one of the city’s deputy mayors. I know I will live, best case, to see these problems get much worse. I feel a kind of existential dread Versini says the heatwave presents serious problems for all homeless people, but particularly women, who are “in twice as much danger”. Exposed to high levels of violence on the streets and often dealing with trauma, she says, many are afraid to access services such as refreshment rooms and public baths where they could cool off. The temperature hits its all-time maximum: 42.6C. The 18th is one of the densest parts of the city, and the photographer and I are struggling. My body is burning up, and now my anxiety is also rising sharply. I know this heatwave has almost certainly been caused by the human-created climate crisis. Greenhouse emissions are on track to reach a record high. I know I will live, best case, to see these problems get much worse. I feel a kind of existential dread. My muscles are starting to get sore. We duck into a supermarket and I end up caressing my face with a range of chilled goods. Orange juice is pretty good but a glass jar of foie gras works best. Temperature: 42.6CAdvice: swim in the canal On a normal day, I harbour no desire to jump into the Bassin de la Villette. I have seen the bikes, shopping trolleys and electric scooters being fished out of there, coated in muck. There are rumours of a crocodile. But the outdoor pool alongside it, which is full of filtered canal water, has been in use since 2017 as part of a plan by the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, to make public waterways such as the Seine swimmable in time for the 2024 Olympics. Anyway, at this stage I would happily leap into a Siberian toxic dump-lake if I thought it would cool me down. Unfortunately there’s a monstrous queue to get in, leaving would-be bathers baking along the pavement. Some have given up and are diving into the open canal. Everyone seems fine with this. I eventually make it to the pool, and lower myself with a sound I didn’t know I was capable of: something between a whimper of fear and a groan of satisfaction. The water is a toasty 25.5C, and oddly slimy, but swimming feels incredible. I’m smiling for the first time in more than 24 hours. I try to avoid thinking about how much canal water I’m ingesting, and that E coli scare from a couple of years ago. Temperature: 41CAdvice: douse yourself in cold water The effects of the pool wear off more or less as soon as I get out of the water and cross a bridge over the canal in full sun. On the other side, Paris Plage – a sandless beach along the banks of the canal and the Seine, set out with deckchairs, bars and summer games – is a muted affair, with most activities shut down because of the heat. A few people languidly dangle their feet in the water. But at the end of the canal, sweet relief. The city authorities have set up a temporary fountain that spouts water out of the top, not just from the taps below. I drench myself through. This is proper cold water, some of the first I’ve encountered today. It is extremely refreshing. I happily drip home on the metro. Temperature: 38CAdvice: avoid alcohol I am too traumatised to cook without air conditioning, so I head back to the same restaurant. The good news is that between breakfast, dinner and the refreshment room today, I have accumulated my required three hours at low temperatures. The bad news is the health department says I shouldn’t drink alcohol during a heatwave, and I could really use a beer. I’m acutely aware that I’m healthy, and have some freedom and control over my movements. Many Parisians don’t Rules are rules, so I stick with a carafe of water. It proves to be a bad choice: a beer would have at least been cold, while this tap water is somehow hotter than room temperature. I was starving but I can now only manage half of my meal, so I wander home to flop on the couch. It’s hot in my living room, but the shutters seem to have fended off the worst. Temperature: 33CAdvice: go to a 24-hour park At midnight, it still hasn’t cooled down enough to sleep. At a mere 33C outside I reckon it’s fine to walk the dog, so off we go towards the Square Sergent Aurélie Salel, one of 13 parks open all night in summer. We pass half an hour there, with a clutch of other overheated young Parisians who are smoking half-heartedly beneath a tree, before turning back home. Jammed between two fans, I grab what sleep I can, but I don’t fully relax until 11am the next day when a thunderstorm breaks the spell. I’m also acutely aware that I’m healthy and have some freedom and control over my movements. Many Parisians don’t: they have to move around the city according to their daily schedules, no matter the temperature. Some have no choice but to be outside all day during a heatwave. With its apps, cool spots and check-in services, the City of Paris is doing a lot to help them, but if my day taught me anything it’s that reality seems to be catching up with what research has long been telling us. The effects of rapid climate change are already here – and we are not ready.

"An Australian farming group has called for a fully funded national strategy to deal with climate change and agriculture, warning farmers don’t have enough support to manage increasing risks associated with global heating. It comes as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on climate change and land, released in Geneva on Thursday, found limiting global heating to below 2C can only be achieved by reducing emissions from all sectors – including land and food.  That will involve transforming food production and land management, given agriculture, forestry and other types of land use account for 23% of human-induced greenhouse emissions globally. The report finds even the current levels of global heating are increasing the risks of water scarcity, soil erosion, vegetation loss, fire damage, coastal degradation, permafrost thawing and declines in crop yields. It finds the climate crisis is affecting all aspects of food security – including availability, price and nutrition – but that coordinated action to cut global emissions could simultaneously improve land resources, food security and nutrition and help to address hunger. Verity Morgan-Schmidt, the chief executive of Farmers for Climate Action, said Australian farmers were already dealing with the effects of global heating, including worsening droughts, changing frost conditions and heatwaves. But as the risks associated with global heating increase, she said it was becoming more difficult for farmers to adapt on their own. Farmers are responsible for managing much of Australia’s ecosystem, with 48% of Australia’s land privately owned or leased for agricultural production. Morgan-Schmidt said industry-wide measures were already being developed to reduce the sector’s climate footprint, including a grains industry sustainability framework that is under development and the red meat sector’s target to become carbon neutral by 2030. She said individual farmers were also taking action through increased soil carbon sequestration, revegetation, and the adoption of “climate-smart” agricultural practices. But she said an overarching government strategy for the agriculture sector was still lacking and farmers were looking to the federal government to better coordinate currently disparate efforts by industry, government and the non-government sector to deal with climate. “What we still don’t have in the year 2019 is a national strategy on climate change in agriculture. There’s still no actual framework to help farmers manage these risks and implement solutions,” she said. “That’s why we’re calling for a fully funded national strategy on climate change and agriculture. “There’s a lot of good things happening but there is more work to do and we need support to do that.” The minister for energy and emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, said: “The government recognises the importance of the land sector to Australia and is partnering with industry to improve productivity, sustainability and resilience.” “Our suite of policies include the establishment of a Future Drought Fund, a national program of water reform, and the Emissions Reduction Fund which supports Australian businesses, farmers and land managers to take practical actions to reduce emissions and improve the environment.” Mark Howden, the director of the ANU Climate Institute and an IPCC vice-chair, is one of the report’s authors. He said the climate crisis was “rapidly ramping up existing threats to the land, reducing its ability to feed and support populations around the world and impacting on ecosystems”. “At the same time, the land sector is currently contributing to climate change, even as it potentially offers some of the solutions to reducing greenhouse gases,” he said. Howden said the land sector alone could not address the crisis and that cutting emissions from fossil fuels remained “absolutely vital”. But he said improving land management would have multiple economic, environmental and health benefits. “Better land management not only delivers win-wins for farmers, communities, governments and biodiversity but also helps address climate change,” he said. Dermot O’Gorman, CEO of the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia, says there “is tremendous potential for vegetation and soil to suck up and store greenhouse gases to help achieve a 1.5-degree future”. “Right now too much of Australia’s soil is degraded or being eroded away. Too many forests have been lost and remaining trees continue to be cut down. “Australia can turn this around by protecting our remaining forests, transforming marginal grazing or cropping land into profitable carbon farms by returning trees, and adopting innovative farming techniques.”"
"When Senator Kamala Harris was asked about climate change during the Democratic debate in June, she did not mince words. “I don’t even call it climate change,” she said. “It’s a climate crisis.” She’s right – and we, at Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness, wish more people would call this crisis what it is.  The language we use to refer to the climate crisis has changed over time, often due to political pressures. In 1975, the geophysicist Wallace S Broecker published the first major paper on planetary heating – Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming? – and for a while the term “global warming” was the most common. But in the decades following, politicians and members of the media began to use the softer, more euphemistic term “climate change” to describe changing weather and atmospheric conditions. That wasn’t an accident. In the early years of George W Bush’s first term as presidency, scientists were actually making serious progress in establishing overwhelming evidence that we were, in fact, facing a global crisis. Public opinion on climate change was shifting; Americans were curious about how worried they should be by the damage being done to our atmosphere. Enter Frank Luntz, a renowned Republican pollster and strategist. Luntz was concerned that the Republican party was losing the communications battle. He advised Republicans to cast doubt on scientific consensus on the dangers of greenhouse gases and to publicly hammer home a message of uncertainty. In 2002, Luntz wrote a memo to Bush urging him and the rest of his party to use the term “climate change” instead of “global warming”. Climate change sounded “less frightening”, he pointed out, “like you’re going from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale”. Luntz succeeded. “Climate change” began to eclipse “global warming” in the American vernacular, downplaying its menacing predecessor. Technically, the term climate change makes sense. The climate is, indeed, changing. But the term is far too mild to describe the existential threat to the planet that these changes pose. Jeffrey Sachs, former director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, agrees. “We should have a term that emphasizes the incredible cost and dangers,” he told us. “We do not need to be shy about this.” Under the administration of Donald Trump, the situation is even worse. Now, instead of re-framing language about the climate crisis, Republican officials simply remove references to it entirely and put pressure on researchers and analysts who disagree. It is time to update the language we use to better reflect the seriousness of global heating. “People do not understand the scale and pace of the climate emergency,” Jamie Henn, strategy and communications director for 350.org, an international climate campaign, told us. “This is not an issue with one future date where we will start to see effects. We may hit tipping points at any time in which we will see immediate problems.” There is no longer any doubt that climate change is an unprecedented planetary emergency. And the terms we use to describe this crisis must deliberately reflect an appropriate sense of urgency. The good news is that there is already some movement in this direction. Scientists, political leaders and the media have finally begun to abandon climate “change” in favor of “crisis” or “emergency”. This summer, The Guardian updated its style guide to designate “climate emergency, crisis, or breakdown” or “global heating” as better descriptors. We applaud that decision and we hope that more journalists, politicians, and intellectual leaders will follow suit. The question is, in the current political climate, will the upgraded terminology result in definitive action? We hope so.

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s more from Schneefan at his climate and weather site wobleibtdieerderwaermung.de here where he reports on mischief by Germany’s DWD national weather service.
The now climate-activist DWD has developed a habit over the past years of issuing warmed up “preliminary” monthly summary reports to describe the month’s weather.
Usually these reports get issued 2 or 3 days before the end of the month, and so Germany’s mean temperature for the month is an estimated value, and later gets revised after the final data come in. So what better opportunity for activists to fudge the preliminary figures on the warm side, and feed the press with them? Later of course the temperature results get quietly revised downward.
One especially egregious example is the DWD’s press release for the preliminary summary of the April 2017 weather. In it they write (emphasis added):

The high pressure conditions of March continued at the start of April, with nearly all areas of Germany enjoying very warm and dry weather. Then, moister and increasingly cold air from the north arrived for the second third of the month. The middle of the month and Easter brought slight to moderate frost and, in some cases, snow even in lowland areas. Overall, temperatures and sunshine duration in the middle of the month were within the normal range.”

In the press release the last 10 days of April, which were bitterly cold, get left out. Schneefan writes that the last ten days of April “were totally left out and they reported on the first 20 days, even though only the last three days of data were missing“.
The media of course act accordingly, and report of warm, balmy conditions. This is how communication of science gets (intentionally?) distorted by sloppy, irresponsible and warming-obsessed officials.
In the DWD press release you have to read down a ways to find out that the mean temperature for April, 2017, in Germany reportedly ended up being 0.8°C below the 1981-2010 mean value, making it the coldest in 16 years.
And lo and behold, later that figure was indeed revised downward: Schneefan writes:

By the way: April 2017 in Germany in contradiction to the – as always hasty and mostly false –  DWD press release of April 28, 2017 a mean temperature of only 7.4°C instead of the given 7.5°C.”
Europe springtime ice box
Not only Germany was icy, but many other countries in Europe as well. The following chart shows the temperature anomalies for the 2nd half of April (mostly ignored by the DWD’s April 28 preliminary report).

Schneefan also reminds that January 2017 in Germany was among the coldest in 20 years, coming in 2.7°C below the 1981-2010 mean.
Also October and November 2016 came is colder than the mean, recording an anomaly of -0.7° and -0.6°C respectively, according to the data from the DWD.
Overall spring has not been arriving earlier in Germany and Central Europe, as many like to have us believe. March mean data has been trending slightly downward in Germany over the past 30 years:

Germany’s comprehensive 2000 stations scattered across the country have been showing no warming over the past decades.

Climate science is supposed to be settled, right?
We are told that there is an overwhelming agreement, or consensus, among scientists that most weather and climate changes that have occurred since the mid-20th century have been caused by human activity — our fossil fuel burning and CO2 emissions in particular.  We are told that natural mechanisms that used to dominate are no longer exerting much of any influence on weather or climate anymore.  Humans predominantly cause weather and climate changes now.
For example, we are told that extreme weather (hurricanes, droughts, floods, storms) frequencies and intensities have increased since about 1950 primarily due to the dramatic rise in anthropogenic CO2 emissions since then.  Humans are now melting glaciers and ice sheets and (Arctic) sea ice at an alarmingly accelerated rate — reminiscent of an impending “death spiral“.  Humans now  heat up and acidify the oceans down to depths of thousands of meters by burning fossil fuels.   Humans are now in the process of raising sea levels so that they will catastrophically rise by 10 feet in the next 50 years.   Because of our CO2 emissions, humans are now endangering the long-term survival of 100s of thousands of animal species (especially polar bears), and climate models say we will cause a million species extinctions over the next 33 years with our CO2 emissions.   The Earth is even spinning slower, or faster, no, slower, well, faster — due to human activities.  Again, this is all settled science.  Only those who possess the temerity to deny this science (“climate deniers”) would disagree, or refuse to believe.
But what if much of what we have been told to believe is not actually true?   What if scientists do not overwhelmingly agree that humans have dominated (with ~110% attribution) weather and climate changes since about 1950, which is what we have been told by the UN IPCC?   What if scientists do not overwhelmingly agree that natural factors exert effectively no influence on weather and climate changes anymore — now that humans have taken over?

These are compelling questions.  Because in 2016 alone, 500 peer-reviewed scientific papers published in scholarly journals seriously question just how settled the “consensus” science really is that says anthropogenic or CO2 forcing now dominates weather and climate changes, and non-anthropogenic (natural) factors no longer exert much, if any, role.
Instead of supporting the “consensus” science one must believe in (to avoid the “climate denier” label), these 500 papers support the position that there are significant limitations and uncertainties inherent in climate modeling and the predictions of future climate catastrophes associated with anthropogenic forcing.  Furthermore, these scientific papers strongly suggest that natural factors (the Sun, multi-decadal oceanic oscillations [NAO, AMO/PDO, ENSO], cloud and aerosol albedo variations, etc.) have both in the past and present exerted a significant or dominant influence on weather and climate changes, which means an anthropogenic signal may be much more difficult to detect in the context of such large natural variability.  Papers questioning (and undermining) the “consensus” view on paleoclimate (Medieval) warmth, ocean acidification, glacier melt and advance, sea level rise, extreme weather events, past climate forcing mechanisms, climate sensitivity to CO2, etc., are included in this collection.
Because of the enormous volume of new papers available that support a skeptical position on anthropogenic climate change alarm, the list of 500 scientific papers with links has been divided into 3 sections, each with its own page (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3).   There are 68 graphs included in the volume, most of which are used to demonstrate that “hockey-stick” reconstructions of past temperatures and sea levels relative to today are not supported by available evidence.
Despite its size, this list will hopefully be user-friendly and easy to navigate as a bookmarkable reference volume due to its outline (below) and organized categorization.  Each paper has an embedded link under the authors’ name(s).
Finally, there are 132 papers linking solar activity to weather and climate change (in addition to another ~90 that link natural oceanic/atmospheric oscillations [ENSO, NAO, etc.], clouds, volcanic activity . . . to climate change).  This is of special note because the IPCC has, since its inception, insisted that solar factors play almost no role in modern climate change.  Apparently scientists agree less and less with that “consensus” position.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhether Hillary wins or not, things are looking grimmer and grimmer for the Democratic Party with each passing day. The Hillary organization is now taking four major blows, simultaneously, and likely will shatter the Clinton backbone to pieces.

Four of Clinton’s biggest nightmares: Jonathan Gruber (Photo: MIT); Julian Assange (Photo: Free Assange); James Comey (Photo: FBI); James O’Keefe (Photo: Project Veritas). Also add a relentless Trey Gowdy to the mix. 
The Democrats would be doing the country a huge and honorable favor in withdrawing the Clinton candidacy – or making sure she does not get elected. This would spare the nation a great crisis. Some even warn of a Constitutional crisis.
The four back-breaking body blows:
1. Skyrocketing Obamacare costs
The runaway costs of healthcare insurance are turning into a grand debacle, one that will plague and enrage Americans for months to come. Nationwide Americans are bracing for an average 25% increase in healthcare premiums starting next year. The authors of this debacle: Obama, Clinton and the Democrats. The upward spiral is only the beginning.
2. Wikileaks
The whiz hackers behind these “illegal” leaks will wear down the Clintons for many more months. The e-mail exchanges expose the inner workings and shady dealings of the Clinton circle. You can view The Top 100 most damaging Wikileaks emails – so far – hat-tip Andrew Bolt.

Wikileak dump number 25 just occurred, and very few of us know how many more are on the way and what’s potentially in store. This alone will be a slow political death by a thousand paper cuts for the Clintons. Clinton’s problems are only beginning.
3. FBI reopened investigation
Right now the 650,000 e-mails discovered on the device of sex pervert (ex-husband of Clinton top aide Huma Abedin, Anthony Weiner, are likely only the tip of the iceberg.
Moreover, one senses there’s a real desperation to keep the e-mails concealed, and that the dam of corruption is about to break. This is a classic situation where when one digs deeper, the more one finds massive rot. Therefore Hillary’s troubles risk growing exponentially. And not only is the scandal reaching the very top levels of the US government, it has the potential of expanding internationally and ensnaring the UN, foreign governments and institutions. And once key players start feeling the heat, they’ll start ratting each other out and cause the dominoes to fall uncontrollably.
One thing is already clear: Clinton illegally managed confidential e-mails, lied to the FBI, and obstructed justice. The rest is just more icing. She is a lawbreaker no matter how you look at it.
4. Project Veritas revelations
The hidden cameras of James O’Keefe reveal voter fraud, intimidation and corruption within Democratic Party. The sleaze uncovered by James O’Keefe only further tarnishes whatever may be left of Clinton’s reputation.
We’re looking at many months, even years, of corruption-caused chaos and scandals. The only hope that the Democrats might overcome the tsunami may be to boldly implement a massive crackdown of the sort are now witnessing in Turkey. That’s a hugely tall order. We wish Hillary and the Democrats lots of luck with that, should they decide to go for it.

"Suddenly, painted ladies are everywhere. From roadside verges and patches of waste ground to the flowerbeds in my Somerset garden, I am seeing dozens of these attractive black, white and orange butterflies, as they flit from flower to flower, feeding hungrily on nectar. They’re not the only butterflies currently on the wing. As the last meadow browns, pale and faded from the sun, straggle along the hedgerows, I’m seeing newly minted gatekeepers and common blues wherever I go. And, on a recent visit to my coastal patch, I came across two exquisite little butterflies, brown argus and small heath: the latter the 21st species of butterfly I have recorded there in less than five years.  This second (mainly) hot and dry summer in a row is good news for butterflies – and butterfly watchers. The charity Butterfly Conservation agrees: its latest statistics for the common blue show that last summer, numbers in England were up a whopping 110% on the year before. Butterfly Conservation predicts that this year’s hot weather could mean that the species will have its best ever summer. But we should remember that butterfly populations have always fluctuated from year to year, depending largely on the prevailing weather conditions. To assess these figures more carefully, we really need to look at the long-term trends, which are rather less positive. For many of Britain’s favourite summer butterflies, including the once-common and familiar small tortoiseshell, there has been a steady decline over the past 40 years or so. This is due to a combination of factors, of which the most serious are the intensification of farming, combined with a more general fragmentation and loss of habitat. Peter Marren, a naturalist whose latest book, Emperors, Admirals and Chimney Sweepers, tells the compelling story of the weird and wonderful names of our butterflies and moths, sounds a note of caution about the recent glut of sightings. While accepting that warm weather is good for adult butterflies, he points out that it may not be quite so favourable for their offspring, which often rely on a specific plant on which their caterpillars feed. “Where butterflies come unstuck in prolonged hot weather is if their larval food plants dry up – for example, if the chalkhill and adonis blues find only stunted, dried-up horseshoe vetch to lay their eggs on.” As he points out, the famous long, hot summer of 1976 was a bumper year for these species, but the following year, 1977, a very poor one, as the majority of caterpillars failed to survive. He also notes that the recent mass appearance of painted ladies – recalling the extraordinary summer of 2009, when tens of millions of these butterflies could be seen throughout the UK – has absolutely nothing to do with the weather here in Britain. Instead, it indicates that conditions were favourable on the fringes of the Sahara in Morocco, where these butterflies came from. The ones we are seeing now are actually the offspring of an earlier generation, which arrived in the UK back in the late spring. These butterflies are now feeding to boost their energy levels in preparation for flying south again. Research by scientists at Butterfly Conservation confirms that the long-term population trend of some of our most charismatic insects is indeed downward, with more than three-quarters of the UK’s butterflies and two-thirds of larger moths in decline. This has a knock-on effect on ecosystems and species: cuckoo chicks, for example, rely on their host parents finding large moth caterpillars for them to survive. But partly because of the shortage of these, cuckoo numbers have dropped by two-thirds since the early 1980s, mirroring the fall in their food supply. We need to know more about population trends in Britain’s butterflies – as we do for any declining species and groups – so Butterfly Conservation urges people to take part in the charity’s annual Big Butterfly Count. As its spokesperson Katie Callaghan explains: “This will provide a picture of how butterflies and larger moths have fared this year, compared with every summer over the last 10 years.” Last year more than 100,000 people took part in the survey, logging almost a million individual butterflies during just 15 minutes of observations. This year’s count ends on 11 August, and so, weather permitting, you still have a chance to take part. As Sir David Attenborough, the organisation’s president, has pointed out, doing so helps contribute to our wider understanding of the UK’s wildlife: “The Big Butterfly Count is about more than just counting butterflies – we’ll be taking the pulse of nature.” One of the biggest threats – and opportunities – facing Britain’s butterflies is the current climate emergency. And, as with any response to higher temperatures, there will be winners and losers. Common and adaptable species, such as the peacock and comma, have already begun to extend their ranges northwards into Scotland, and are likely to continue to do well as the climate heats up. But, as Marren points out, rare and localised species are less likely to be able to respond to change, especially if, as predicted, it changes the nature of their more specialised habitats. One example is the wood white, a delicate butterfly found in woodlands in a few parts of southern England and the West Midlands, where it can be seen fluttering along woodland rides and the sheltered edges of clearings. Although higher temperatures should in theory allow the wood white to shift its range northwards, its inability to cross large swathes of unsuitable habitat means that it is unable to take advantage of a warming world. We would also expect that, as average spring and summer temperatures continue to rise, new butterfly species will cross the Channel, adding to our paltry total of fewer than 60 species (compared with almost 500 in Europe as a whole). Yet despite the rise in records of continental European species such as the large tortoiseshell, long-tailed blue and the spectacular queen of Spain fritillary during the past decade, none has yet managed to establish permanent breeding populations here. That’s in sharp contrast to other groups of flying insects, such as moths and damselflies, of which several species have successfully colonised in Britain. Surely it is only a matter of time before those new butterflies join them. So, to sum up, some of Britain’s butterflies are enjoying the benefits of hotter-than-average summers – at least in the short term – while, as with all our wild creatures, they face an uncertain future in a rapidly changing world. What is certain is that their loss would be a condemnation of our lack of stewardship of the natural world. For, perhaps more than any other living creatures, butterflies symbolise that rare combination of inspirational beauty and fragility, perfectly summed up by Marren in his book Rainbow Dust: “I believe that the flutterings [of a butterfly’s wing] can summon up at least a small breeze in the human soul. Let it blow … and let it remind we earthbound humans everywhere of the power and wonder of the natural world.” Stephen Moss is a naturalist, author and lecturer based in Somerset  • Persuading butterflies to choose your garden is relatively simple: provide plants that produce the nectar on which the adults will feed • Native wild flowers are often considered to be more suitable than non-native ones, but the real key is making sure there are nectar-rich flowers in bloom from April through to October • Letting part of your garden go wild, with nettles, thistles, grasses and other “weeds”, will provide a place for caterpillars to feed and pupate, ensuring you have a new generation of butterflies later on • In autumn, leave fallen fruit on the ground: painted ladies and red admirals love feeding on the fermenting juices • Avoid using pesticides and chemicals.

Insidious preindustrial warm phase: 4000 years ago glaciers in Norway had  almost completely melted away
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The University of Bergen in Norway reported 14 February 2017 on the climate in Norway 4000 years ago, when in the summertime it was on average two to three degrees warmer than today. Most glaciers in the country at the time had almost completely melted away and gone. Instead of examining these what for many are unexpected warm phases, the team of authors in the press release chose to focus the public’s attention on concern and fear for the future.
And this time – for sure – the glaciers are never coming back again, even though they did so after the last warm phase. Instead the scientists worry about the hydropower business. No glacier, no hydro-power. What follows is the press release:
Norwegian ice cap ‘exceptionally sensitive’ to climate change

How will future climate change affect our glaciers? By looking into the past 4000 years, a new study lead by Henning Åkesson at the Bjerknes Centre finds an ice cap in southern Norway to be ‘exceptionally sensitive’ to climate change.

The team of researchers from the Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research, the Netherlands and the US took a glance into the past to understand how the ice cap Hardangerjøkulen in southern Norway responds to climate change. The authors simulated the history of the ice cap over the last 4000 years, from a period called the mid-Holocene, when summer temperature at high northern latitudes were two to three degrees warmer than today. Most if not all glaciers in Norway melted away during this period, Hardangerjøkulen included. 
Henning Åkesson, a PhD candidate at the Bjerknes Centre and University of Bergen, used a glacier computer model developed at NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory and University of California, Irvine to simulate Hardangerjøkulen’s history. To inform model simulations, he used information on past climates and glacier variations from lake sediments receiving meltwater from the ice cap.
Contest between snow and snowmelt
“Present day Hardangerjøkulen is in a very vulnerable state, and our study of its history over the last several thousand years shows that the ice cap may change drastically in response to relatively minor changes in climate conditions”, says Åkesson. Every year, snow covers a glacier in winter, and melts away to a varying extent the following summer. At a certain altitude on the glacier, the competition between snow accumulation and snowmelt is balanced; glaciologists call this the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA). “What is special with Hardangerjøkulen and other similar ice caps”, Åkesson explains, “is their flat topography. Anyone skiing up Hardangerjøkulen to celebrate Norway’s national day on May 17th can testify; first it’s steep, but once you’re higher up things get a lot easier.”
A large part of Hardangerjøkulen’s area is close to the present ELA. This means that a small change in the competition between winter snow and summer melt will affect a very large part of the ice cap. Åkesson says “the topography and present climate is such that we soon expect yearly net melt over the entire ice cap. This has already happened a few times in recent years. In the near future we expect this to occur much more often, and with this, the demise of Hardangerjøkulen will accelerate.”  “Today the ice is more than 300 m thick at places, which may sound like a lot. But the implication of our study is that if climate warming continues, this ice cap may disappear before the end of this century. I don’t think most people realize how fast glaciers can change, maybe not even us as scientists,” says Åkesson.

Hydropower from glacier meltwater
“The economic and cultural implications of disappearing glaciers in Norway are considerable for tourism, natural heritage and the hydropower industry”, Kerim Hestnes Nisancioglu at the Bjerknes Centre, co-author of the study, adds. Practically all of Norway’s electricity is generated from hydropower, of which 15 % depend on glacier meltwater. “The hydropower industry needs to plan for these changes, and we need to work together to find out how fast this transition will happen”, Nisancioglu says. What is more, “if Hardangerjøkulen melts away completely, it would not be able to grow back again given today’s climate”, Åkesson concludes. The study was published in the open-access journal The Cryosphere on January 27th. Read the full study here.

What happened on the sun 7000 years ago?
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt

(German text translated/edited by P Gosselin)
At the end of January 2017 a team of scientists led by Fusa Miyake described in PNAS an unexpected solar event on the sun that ended up being registered in 7000 year old tree rings. What follows is the press release from Nagoya University:
What Happened to the Sun over 7,000 Years Ago? Analysis of tree rings reveals highly abnormal solar activity in the mid-Holocene
An international team led by researchers at Nagoya University, along with US and Swiss colleagues, has identified a new type of solar event and dated it to the year 5480 BC; they did this by measuring carbon-14 levels in tree rings, which reflect the effects of cosmic radiation on the atmosphere at the time. They have also proposed causes of this event, thereby extending knowledge of how the sun behaves.
When the activity of the sun changes, it has direct effects on the earth. For example, when the sun is relatively inactive, the amount of a type of carbon called carbon-14 increases in the earth’s atmosphere. Because carbon in the air is absorbed by trees, carbon-14 levels in tree rings actually reflect solar activity and unusual solar events in the past. The team took advantage of such a phenomenon by analyzing a specimen from a bristlecone pine tree, a species that can live for thousands of years, to look back deep into the history of the sun.
“We measured the 14C levels in the pine sample at three different laboratories in Japan, the US, and Switzerland, to ensure the reliability of our results,” A. J. Timothy Jull of the University of Arizona says. “We found a change in 14C that was more abrupt than any found previously, except for cosmic ray events in AD 775 and AD 994, and our use of annual data rather than data for each decade allowed us to pinpoint exactly when this occurred.”
The team attempted to develop an explanation for the anomalous solar activity data by comparing the features of the 14C change with those of other solar events known to have occurred over the last couple of millennia. “Although this newly discovered event is more dramatic than others found to date, comparisons of the 14C data among them can help us to work out what happened to the sun at this time,” Fusa Miyake of Nagoya University says. She adds, “We think that a change in the magnetic activity of the sun along with a series of strong solar bursts, or a very weak sun, may have caused the unusual tree ring data.” Although the poor understanding of the mechanisms behind unusual solar activity has hampered efforts to definitively explain the team’s findings, they hope that additional studies, such as telescopic findings of flares given off by other sun-like stars, could lead to an accurate explanation.
The article “Large 14C excursion in 5480 BC indicates an abnormal sun in the mid-Holocene” was published in PNAS at: www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1613144114.”
Could this solar event also have left climatic traces?

Modern Rates During The Mid-Holocene

Annotated graph from Rosenthal et al. (2013) illustrating the steep amplitude of natural variations in ocean heat
It has long been acknowledged by scientists that significant changes in deep ocean heat content have occurred in the past in the absence of changes or forcing from CO2.  Stott et al. (2007), for example, conclude that deep ocean temperatures rose by 2°C within a 2,000-year time span (19,000 to 17,000 years ago) about a 1,000 years before CO2 concentrations (and surface temperatures) began to rise.
Stott et al., 2007

Deep sea temperatures warmed by ~2C between 19 and 17 ka B.P., leading the rise in atmospheric CO2 and tropical surface ocean warming by ~1000 years.

Similarly,  Demezhko and Gornostaeva (2015) found that the heat energy change in the deep oceans during the climate transition from the last ice age to this current interglacial occurred “2-3 thousands of years” before the increases in surface temperature and CO2, and that “the increase of carbon dioxide may be a consequence [rather than a cause] of temperature increasing”.  The authors then acknowledge that this suggests that there was “no significant contribution of CO2 forcing to climatically caused heat flux and thus to the temperature increase during the Pleistocene-Holocene warming”.
Demezhko and Gornostaeva, 2015

Despite the substantial dispersion of CO2 estimations, a character and a chronology of CO2 concentration changes are much closer to temperature changes rather than to heat flux variations. It may mean no significant contribution of CO2 forcing to climatically caused heat flux and thus to the temperature increase during Pleistocene–Holocene warming. About 10 kyr BP the increase of carbon dioxide concentration was replaced by its fall which ended about 8 kyr BP. This local minimum [in CO2 concentration] is not consistent with either GST [ground surface temperature] or SHF [surface heat flux] histories.  … The reconstructed surface heat flux reflects impact of all possible sources of radiative forcing. In addition to solar insolation, greenhouse gases (such as CO2) can be a source of additional forcing. On the other hand the increase of carbon dioxide may be a consequence of temperature increasing. Comparing the chronology of surface flux, temperature and carbon dioxide concentration changes, we can draw some conclusions about the causes of climate change. …  The increase of carbon dioxide concentrations occurred 2–3 thousands of years later than the heat flux increase and synchronously with temperature response. 

Scientists Ellis and Palmer (2016) get right to the point and conclude CO2 plays “little or no” role in forcing the warming during interglacial periods…

Conclusion: [I]nterglacial warming is eccentricity and polar ice regrowth regulated, Great Summer forced, and dust-ice albedo amplified. And the greenhouse-gas attributes of CO2 play little or no part in this complex feedback system.

….while scientists Douglass and Knox (2014) identify the source of modern deep ocean temperature forcing that has an “unquestionably solar origin” manifested by El Niño/La Niña phenomena.

Global ocean temperature time series from the surface to depths of 2000 m since the year 2000 are found to agree in detail with those of other diverse climate indices. It is asserted that these systems are driven by a forcing unquestionably of solar origin that has two manifestations: (1) a direct phase-locked response to what is identified as a solar forcing at a frequency of 1.0 cycle/yr for the whole time series; (2) a second phase-locked response at a period of two years or three years. With these findings it is becoming clear that the entire climate system is responding to the varying incident solar radiation… The most prominent manifestations of the pattern are found in the El Niño/La Niña phenomena.

Advocates of the assumption that CO2 variations are a primary cause of changes in deep ocean heat content (i.e., those who author government-sponsored IPCC reports and activists for the anthropogenic global warming cause) have necessarily believed that past natural variations in deep ocean heat content are very slow and gradual.  They have presumed that the forcing from Milankovitch cycles (changes in solar radiation absorbed by the Earth’s surface due to orbital variations) are the cause of deep ocean changes over time, but that these changes occur only as slowly as orbital variations occur — on millennial scales (“several thousand years“), not in decades to centuries.  In this way, they can deny that the Sun plays a role in modern climate changes…despite burgeoning evidence to the contrary.  The Stott et al. (2007) finding that deep oceans warmed at a rate of 1°C/1,000 years referenced above would be consistent with these assumptions.

Brown University geologist Samantha Bova and her colleagues reach a different conclusion, however, in a paper just published online for the prestigious journal Geophysical Research Letters.  These scientists have found that, in the absence of any significant CO2 concentration changes or human influence during the Holocene (i.e., the last ~10,000 years), the deep oceans naturally warmed by more than 2°C in a span of just 200 years, which is several times the rate in which they are alleged to have warmed in the last ~60 years of the supposedly dominant anthropogenic influence on climate.  In fact, Bova et al. (2016) conclude that deep ocean temperature changes for the last 200 years are apparently so negligible they are “below the detection limits”.
Bova et al., 2016
The observational record of deep-ocean variability is short, which makes it difficult to attribute the recent rise in deep ocean temperatures to anthropogenic forcing. Here, we test a new proxy – the oxygen isotopic signature of individual benthic foraminifera – to detect rapid (i.e. monthly to decadal) variations in deep ocean temperature and salinity in the sedimentary record. We apply this technique at 1000 m water depth in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific during seven 200-year Holocene intervals. Variability in foraminifer δ18O over the past 200 years is below the detection limit [a change in ocean heat cannot be detected in the past 200 years], but δ18O signatures from two mid-Holocene intervals indicate temperature swings >2 °C within 200 years.
According to the IPCC (2013), 93% of the heat energy in the climate system claimed to be due to anthropogenic global warming is found in the oceans (AR5, Chapter 3).  Levitus et al. (2012) estimate that the heat energy change (converted to temperature) amounted to an increase of just +0.09°C between 1955 and 2010 in the upper 2000 meters of the ocean, or less than one-tenth of one degree over 55 years.
Levitus et al., 2012

The World Ocean accounts for approximately 93% of the warming of the earth system that has occurred since 1955. … The heat content of the World Ocean for the 0–2000 m layer increased by 24.0 ± 1.9 × 1022 J (±2S.E.) [over 1955-2010] corresponding to a rate of 0.39 W m−2 (per unit area of the World Ocean) and a volume mean warming of 0.09°C.

Again, natural variation in ocean temperatures may reach amplitudes of + or – 1°C every 100 years without any external forcing from anthropogenic CO2 emissions.  So if 93% of the change forced by the alleged human climate influence  has only produced a temperature change of hundredths to tenths of a °C in the deep oceans since 1955, or since CO2 concentrations rose by about 75 parts per million (315 ppm in 1955 to 390 ppm in 2010), this would clearly indicate that it is extremely difficult if not effectively impossible to confidently attribute the practically imperceptible change in ocean temperature to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, or to CO2 in general.
More succinctly, if deep ocean temperatures can naturally rise by 1°C in 100 years without any change in CO2, then attributing changes in ocean temperature that are already “below the detection limit” for the last 200 years (or just ~0.1°C since 1955) to anthropogenic CO2 forcing is highly presumptuous at best.
And if 93% of the heat from “global warming” cannot be attributed to humans with any degree of confidence, then there is necessarily no such conceptualization of anthropogenic global warming that could be claimed to have been affirmed scientifically.  Effectively, if we cannot detect an anthropogenic signal in deep ocean heat data, anthropogenic global warming would necessarily be characterized as a belief, not a scientifically confirmed hypothesis.
