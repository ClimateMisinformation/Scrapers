"Pollution has gotten so bad in China that Prime Minister Li Keqiang opened the annual meeting of parliament on Wednesday declaring a “war against pollution”. This followed the surge in smog over Chinese cities in recent weeks. Thick smog blanketed northern China for seven days straight, with pollution indexes at hazardous levels. Citizens have a key role to play in holding their government accountable to its promises to end the airpocalypse and they are increasingly taking action. During the latest coverage, a resident of the northern industrial city of Shijiazhuang, Li Guixin, attempted to sue his local municipal government over the high levels of air pollution. This is not the first time a Chinese citizen has done this – it has happened with water pollution from industry before – but it is the first time the finger has been pointed at local government for failing to curb smog, and so close to Beijing. Without doubt, one of the reasons his efforts have made the international news is his proximity to the capital and the timing of his complaints overlapped with a week of intense smog in Beijing itself. Interestingly, he demanded 10,000 yuan (about £1,000) in compensation – for what he spent on face masks, an air purifier and a treadmill to exercise indoors. But he explained that his real aim is to raise awareness and let citizens see they are the victims of pollution, whereas local governments who receive corporate taxes are the beneficiaries. This is a pressing point about the uneven spread of costs and benefits in China. Hours after news of the lawsuit was published, China’s president Xi Jinping visited central Beijing without any protection from the bad air – an act many viewed as an attempt to downplay the severity of pollution. The Beijing city government shared a widely circulated post: “breathe the same air and share the same fate” on their microblog. But people as a whole have not been too convinced.  Key government buildings are fitted with air purifiers and those who can afford them, buy purifiers for their homes. At a cost of US$3,000, however, many cannot afford these expensive items. Another strategy is to escape, moving home or buying a second house in the countryside. Again not everyone can afford to do this.  Just as the wealthy move away from pollution, pollution increasingly moves into poorer areas, into China’s interior. Pollution then becomes more and more closely mapped onto social inequalities and it makes them worse: the poor are often more exposed to environmental risks and yet unable to pay to prevent or treat illnesses associated with these risks. Plus, the health effects of pollution are becoming increasingly apparent. With reason to believe that illnesses and premature death may have been caused by pollution, many citizens have started to ask: “Why should we suffer for this? Who is benefiting? Can’t there be an alternative?” Conscious of their concerns, the Chinese government has encouraged some public participation in measuring the impact of pollution. New rules state that official data on polluters should be made public. Enterprises including some big state owned enterprises are required to publish in real time details of air pollution, waste water and heavy metal discharges. But this only really happens if there is pressure from citizens to do so and more must be done. Citizens are increasingly raising the alarm. Lawsuits such as Li Guixin’s are one, but by no means the only, avenue. Local NGOs play an important role, but they are not present everywhere. Resort to official and social media is another way to gain attention.  Citizens file petitions, negotiate with firms and sometimes take to the streets. Protests (normally peaceful) in recent years in Ningbo, Xiamen, Dalian and Shanghai among other cities are all examples of this. Protestors are often tech savvy, sharing information via mobile and microblogs like weibo and we-chat about pollution, its effects and local government collusion with industry. Efforts to gather data on air pollution is part of a wider trend that may be called “citizen science”. That is, attempts by citizens to collate their own scientific evidence of pollution’s severity and to lobby industries and local governments with this data, to demand a cleaner environment. Examples in relation to air pollution include grassroots NGOs like Green Beagle and Nature University, which provided portable handheld detectors for citizens to measure air quality, or Float Beijing, which used small pollution monitors fixed on kites.  Many of these are efforts by urban middle classes, but it does not mean that villagers are putting up with pollution in silence. The difference is that their complaints are more likely to remain invisible. This could be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, it means that much local discontent remains just that, local discontent. On the other hand, it means that citizens’ anxieties over pollution are much broader and deeper than current reporting might suggest.  At the same time, we must remember that people often have intricate relationships to pollution and their reactions to the situation are complex. In my work I have outlined a depressing scenario in which citizens learn to live with pollution and come to regard it as inevitable. Instead of fighting it, they adjust their parameters for a good life to include pollution and even come to doubt their abilities to prove that they suffer from its effects.  As development pushes further and deeper into China’s interior, the anxieties of poorer, more rural citizens will likely only increase. Unless development is done sustainably, it is bound to cause problems further down the line – not only environmentally but also in terms of social stability. Li Guixin’s lawsuit is just one example of this. In both cities and the countryside, China is better off with citizens who feel they can play an active role in raising the alarm against pollution, confident that they will not lose out economically if they do so. Industry needs to conform to standards set by the government and ultimately, citizens will need government help to make this happen."
"From transport and housing to food production and fashion, our civilisation is driving climate and ecological breakdown. It’s no coincidence that almost every single sector of industry is contributing to the planet’s downfall, either. A deeper issue underlies each one’s part in the malaise enveloping the planet’s ecosystems – and its origins date back to long before the industrial revolution. To truly bring ourselves into harmony with the natural world, we must return to seeing humanity as part of it. Though a varied and complex story, the widespread separation of humans from nature in Western culture can be traced to a few key historical developments, starting with the rise of Judeo-Christian values 2000 years ago. Prior to this point, belief systems with multiple gods and earth spirits, such as paganism, dominated. They generally considered the sacred to be found throughout nature, and humanity as thoroughly enmeshed within it.  When Judaism and Christianity rose to become the dominant religious force in Western society, their sole god – as well as sacredness and salvation – were re-positioned outside of nature. The Old Testament taught that God made humans in his own image and gave them dominion over the Earth. As historian Lynn White famously argued, such values laid the foundations of modern anthropocentrism, a system of beliefs that frames humans as separate from and superior to the nonhuman world. Indeed, those who hold literal beliefs in the Bible tend to express significantly more concerns over how environmental degradation affects humans than animals. In the early 17th century, French father of modern philosophy René Descartes framed the world as essentially split between the realm of mind and that of inert matter. As the only rational beings, Descartes saw humans as wholly separate from and superior to nature and nonhuman animals, who were considered mere mindless machines to be mastered and exploited at will. Descartes’ work was hugely influential in shaping modern conceptions of science and human and animal identities in Western society. White and philosopher Val Plumwood were among the first to suggest that it is these attitudes themselves that cause the world’s environmental crises. For example, when we talk of “natural resources” and fish stocks"", we are suggesting that the Earth’s fabric holds no value apart from what it provides us. That leads us to exploit it recklessly. According to Plumwood, the opposition between reason and nature also legitimised the subjugation of social groups who came to be closely associated with nature – women, the working class, the colonised, and the indigenous among them. Scholars such as Timothy Morton and Bruno Latour remind us that viewing the natural world as separated from humans is not only ethically problematic but empirically false. Microorganisms in our gut aid digestion, while others compose part of our skin. Pollinators such as bees and wasps help produce the food we eat, while photosynthetic organisms such as trees and phytoplankton provide the oxygen that we need in order to live, in turn taking up the carbon dioxide we expel.

      Nature is being renamed 'natural capital' – but is it really the planet that will profit?


 In the Anthropocene, we are seeing more and more how the fates of humanity and nature are intertwined. Governments and corporations have developed such control over the natural systems they exploit that they are destabilising the fundamental chemistry of the global climate system. As a result, inhospitable heat, rising seas, and increasingly frequent and extreme weather events will render millions of humans and animals refugees. The good news is that the perceived separation from nature is not universal among the planet’s human inhabitants. Australian, Amerindian, and countless other indigenous belief systems often portray nonhumans as kin with intrinsic value to be respected, rather than external objects to be dominated or exploited. Eastern philosophies and religions such as Zen Buddhism also entangle humanity and nature, emphasising that there is no such thing as an independent self and that all things depend on others for their existence and well-being. For example, strongly influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, Bhutan has enshrined ecological resilience into its constitution. Mandating that at least 60% of the nation remain forested, the country is one of just two in the world to absorb more carbon than it emits. It measures progress not by GDP but against a “gross national happiness” index, which prioritises human and ecological well-being over boundless economic growth. Of course, entanglement with nature exists in the Western world too. But the global socioeconomic systems birthed by this region were founded on the exploitation of the natural world for profit. Transforming these entrenched ways of working is no easy feat. It will take time, and education is key. Higher education textbooks and courses across disciplines consistently perpetuate destructive relationships with nature. These must be redesigned to steer those about to enter the world of work towards care for the environment.

      A climate change curriculum to empower the climate strike generation


 However, to bring about widespread fundamental change in worldviews, we need to start young. Practices such as nature journaling in early primary school – in which children record their experiences of the natural world in written and art form – can cultivate wonder at and connection to the natural world. Schools should use every opportunity in the curriculum and playtime to tell children a new story of our place within the natural world. Economist and philosopher Charles Eisenstein calls for an overarching “Living Earth” narrative that views the earth not as a dead rock with resources to exploit, but as a living system whose health depends on the health of its organs and tissues – its wetlands, forests, seagrass, mangroves, fish, corals, and more. According to this story, the decision of whether to fell a forest for cattle grazing is not merely weighed against carbon accounting – which allows us to offset the cost by installing solar panels – but against respect for the forest and its inhabitants. Such a world might seem unthinkable. But if we use our imagination now, in a few decades we might find our grandchildren creating the story we want them to believe in.

I noticed that my paper copies of Politico have been quite thick this week. Is there a lot of news? Well, yes. But newspapers usually run all the news the advertising will support. And Politico is just chock‐​full of ads in this budget season. As I wrote in my favorite chapter of _The Libertarian Mind_ , “What Big Government Is All About,” there’s been a huge boom in the business of getting taxpayers’ money in the past few years:



Every business and interest group in society has an office in Washington devoted to getting some of the $4 trillion federal budget for itself: senior citizens, farmers, veterans, teachers, social workers, oil companies, labor unions, the military‐​industrial complex—you name it. The massive spending increases of the Bush‐​Obama years have created a lot of well‐​off people in Washington. Consulting and contracting exploded after 9/11. New regulatory burdens, notably from Obamacare and the Dodd‐​Frank financial regulation bill, are generating jobs in the lobbying and regulatory compliance business.



“Walk down K Street, the heart of Washington’s lobbying industry, and look at the directories in the office buildings. They’re full of lobbyists and associations that are in Washington, for one reason: because, as Willie Sutton said about why he robbed banks, “That’s where the money is.”…



“How much would you spend to get a $200 million subsidy from the federal government? About $199 million if you had to, I’ll bet.



So what does that have to do with the page counts in Politico? Well, check out this list of the full‐​page ads in Tuesday’s and Wednesday’s editions:



International Council of Shopping Centers (tax the internet)  
National Multifamily Housing Council/​National Apartment Association  
My Plate, My Planet (federal food guidelines)  
CA Technologies  
American Medical Association (more Medicare money for doctors)  
Innovation Alliance (patent law)  
Alzheimer’s Assocation (federal research money)  
United Launch Alliance (NASA contracts)  
Navy League (military spending)  
Beer Institute (beer taxes)  
Society for Human Resource Management  
United Technologies  
Americans for the Arts (taxpayer funding)  
Better Medicare Alliance (insurance companies and others, more Medicare funding)  
Natural Products Association  
Oil and Natural Gas Industry  
Boeing/​Textron (fund the V-22)  
Application Developers Alliance (patent law)  
American Bankers Association  
Aerospace Industries Association (fund the Ex‐​Im Bank)  
Aircraft Carrier Industrial Base Coalition (build more carriers)  
Patient Access to Pharmacists’ Care Coalition (more Medicare money)  
U.S. Travel Association (increase tax on air travelers)  
NextEra Energy (recipient of $2 billion in federal subsidies)  
Boeing  
Comcast (allow merger with TimeWarner Cable)



Some of these organizations ran full‐​page ads both days, or even two ads in the same edition. Some had a specific request, generally for taxpayers’ money. Others just ran image‐​enhancement ads, so Politico’s readers in Washington would look kindly on them.





Those with their eyes on the taxpayers’ money will know no rest by day or night.



A century ago the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto explained how the lobbying process works. Imagine, he said, there is a proposal to take one dollar from every citizen and give the total to 30 people. “Those who hope to gain a million a year will know no rest by day and night. They will win newspapers over to their interest by financial inducements and drum up support from all quarters. A discreet hand will warm the palms of needy legislators, even of ministers.” On the other hand, he said, those who were threatened with the loss of a dollar would likely never know of the scheme, and even if they did, wouldn’t find it worth taking the trouble to protest. Which is how you get to a $4 trillion federal budget funding everything from — well, from aircraft carriers to pharmacists.



Never underestimate the creativity of the lobbyists and their clients. I wrote recently in _Reason_ about how General Dynamics, worried that military spending was no longer a boom area, “suddenly … managed to become the largest contractor to Medicare and Medicaid. ‘For traditional defense contractors,’ wrote Kaiser Health, ‘health care isn’t the new oil. It’s the new F-35 fighter.’” And now the _Washington Post_ reports that Lockheed is finding “growth opportunities” in “a different threat to national security: climate change.” Those with their eyes on the taxpayers’ money will know no rest by day or night.

"**Facebook has said it will start to label potentially harmful posts that it leaves up because of their news value.**
The more hands-on approach comes as the social media firm is under pressure to improve how it moderates the content on its platform, including posts by US President Donald Trump.
More than 90 advertisers have joined a boycott of the site.
Consumer goods giant Unilever on Friday added its name to the list, citing a ""polarized election period"" in the US.
The maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream said it would halt Twitter, Facebook and Instagram advertising in the US ""at least"" through 2020.
""Continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society,"" it said. ""We will revisit our current position if necessary.""
In a speech on Friday, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg defended the firm's record of taking down hate speech.
He pointed to a European Commission report this month that found Facebook removed 86% of hate speech last year, up from 82.6%.
But he said the firm was tightening its policies to ""address the reality of the challenges our country is facing and how they're showing up across our community"".
He said the firm would ban ads that describe different groups, based on descriptors such as race or immigration status, as a threat. It will also remove content - even from a politician - if it determines that it incites violence or suppresses voting.
Mr Zuckerberg also said the firm will attach a label to ""problematic"" content that falls outside of those categories.
""A handful of times a year, we leave up content that would otherwise violate our policies if the public interest value outweighs the risk of harm,"" he said. ""Often, seeing speech from politicians is in the public interest, and in the same way that news outlets will report what a politician says, we think people should generally be able to see it for themselves on our platforms.
""We will soon start labelling some of the content we leave up because it is deemed newsworthy, so people can know when this is the case,"" he said.
Twitter has already taken some similar steps, including banning advertisements from politicians and adding labels and warnings to some kinds of content,including tweets by Mr Trump.
""We have developed policies and platform capabilities designed to protect and serve the public conversation, and as always, are committed to amplifying voices from under-represented communities and marginalized groups,"" said Twitter executive Sarah Personette.
Shares of Facebook and Twitter both fell more than 7% on Friday.
Some boycott organisers said Mr Zuckerberg's promises did not go far enough.
""What we've seen in today's address from Mark Zuckerberg is a failure to wrestle with the harms [Facebook] has caused on our democracy & civil rights"" said Color of Change president Rashad Robinson said.
""If this is the response he's giving to major advertisers withdrawing millions of dollars from the company, we can't trust his leadership,"" he wrote on Twitter.
The ""Stop Hate for Profit"" campaign was started by US civil rights groups after the death of George Floyd in May while in police custody. It has focused on Facebook, which also owns Instagram; and WhatsApp and last year attracted advertising revenue of almost $70bn (Â£56.7bn).
The organisers, which include Color of Change and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, have said Facebook allows ""racist, violent and verifiably false content to run rampant on its platform"".
More than 90 companies including Verizon and Patagonia have joined the campaign, according to a list by ad activism group Sleeping Giants, one of the organisers.
Nicole Perrin, analyst at eMarketer, said it will be difficult to determine the financial impact of the boycott on Facebook, given the significant changes in advertising amid the pandemic.
But she said Unilever's announcement was significant, noting that the firm was dropping the ads for longer than called for, and on more platforms.
""That suggests a deeper problem with user-generated content platforms, as divisiveness is to be expected on any such platform that allows political expression,"" she said."

The Susquehanna Nuclear Power Station, a boiling water reactor.
Dr. James Hansen’s reply to my question about Nuclear Power
Guest essay by Eric Worrall
A a few years ago, Anthony Watts posted a link “The Middle Ground where AGW skeptics and Proponents should meet up“. At AGU2013, Anthony asked Dr. Hansen a question in full session about the very same topic and a video of that exchange follows.
The proposition is, that in the highly polarized global warming debate, there are, or should be, some surprisingly broad areas of agreement. A video also follows showing Anthony asking Dr. Hansen about this at AGU2013

One such area of agreement appears to be support for nuclear power. In addition to the Middle Ground article, WUWT has posted many other articles, on Thorium and next generation nuclear technology, which have been well received by regular readers of this blog.
Dr. James Hansen is also a supporter of nuclear power. A few months ago, James Hansen, Ken Caldeira, Kerry Emanuel and Tom Wigley published an open letter, calling for and end to opposition to nuclear power, for the sake of the environment.
If I have understood correctly, scientists who are truly concerned about CO2, such as James Hansen, support nuclear power, because nuclear power a plausible route to decarbonising the economy, without the difficulty of convincing voters to accept drastic curbs to their lifestyles.
Skeptics like myself tend to support nuclear power, because it is the future – we tend to love high technology and the glorious rise of human civilisation, and yet we are, contrary to the straw man stereotypes projected by many of our opponents, concerned about environmental issues, such as the megatons of toxic ash and sludge produced by coal power stations. We see next generation nuclear power as the clean, inexhaustible energy source of the future.
So I sent an email to Dr. James Hansen mid March this year, asking whether he had ever considered sharing a platform with Anthony Watts, to jointly promote acceptance of a nuclear powered future. I made it very clear I was asking this question on my own initiative, and had not discussed it with Anthony.
This was Dr. Hansen’s reply:-
“The more important matter is the need for a slowly rising revenue neutral carbon fee, 100% of the funds distributed to the public, equal amount to all legal residents.  This would cause nuclear power to win out for electricity. Otherwise we are going to get a very expensive dual renewables–fossil fuel system.  This fee-and-dividend approach is by its nature a conservative agenda, allowing the market to work.  It is also a winning populist political strategy, providing some correction to the increasing disparity of wealth, allowing the hard-working careful low-income person a chance to make some money and contribute to a cleaner, healthier world.  This is what conservatives need to understand.  If they don’t, the changing demographics will sink them, and we will all suffer under a screwed up energy system.”
I replied to Dr. Hansen, pointing out that Conservative opposition to carbon fees was entrenched, and asked whether the issue of how to make nuclear power economically attractive, on which there was no agreement, could be set aside for now, for the sake of jointly promoting  research into next generation nuclear technology.
So far I have not received a reply to my second email to Dr. Hansen.
The conversation and questions I put to Dr. Hansen were meant in good faith. I hope the dialogue I have had to date with Dr. Hansen is not the end, that the conversation goes further, perhaps with other participants. Perhaps I am being naive, but I really am a keen supporter of nuclear power, and would like to find a way for everyone who supports a nuclear future to join forces, to overcome the decades of propaganda against nuclear technology, which has retarded its development in the West.
Here is Anthony asking Dr. Hansen about Thorium power at AGU2013

"Lyon, Strasbourg and Bordeaux; Besançon, Poitiers and Tours: the list of powerful cities that turned green, after France’s municipal elections last weekend, was long and impressive. Marseille has been a conservative fiefdom for decades. But a leftwing alliance propelled Michèle Rubirola, the candidate of Europe Ecology – France’s Green party – to the mayoralty. These were totemic victories, turning the once-peripheral Green party into a significant player in urban France. Sunday’s polls should have taken place in March but were postponed as France locked down. Perhaps because of that delay, and the lingering presence of Covid-19, turnout was low. That may have disproportionately helped Green candidates, whose voters tend to loyally turn out for local elections, and Europe Ecology is still well down the pecking order in national polls. But these caveats aside, the “green wave” in France offers heartening evidence that environmental priorities are truly beginning to shape and influence politics in Europe.  In Ireland, the new grand coalition of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael depends on the support of the Green party, which will insist that a pledge to cut carbon emissions by 7% a year is kept. Austria is governed by an alliance of the populist right People’s party and the Greens. Eco-targets are being fast-tracked and the Green minister for climate protection, environment and energy is seeking to make Austria carbon neutral by 2040. The Green-dominated bloc of MEPs in the European parliament is also a force to be reckoned with. The biggest prize of all could be won in next year’s general election in Germany, where polls suggest that Die Grünen may overtake the Social Democrats as the country’s leading progressive force . A “greencon” coalition is seen as a plausible future government, after Angela Merkel stands down following a 15-year chancellorship. It seems certain that the politics of Covid-19 played a part in generating green momentum in France. The origins of the pandemic, and its effect on globalised supply chains, has led to a renewed focus across Europe on food security, local produce and environmental standards. A forced re-evaluation of urban living has led to new government money for greener forms of transport and a focus on home-working. Cities such as Bordeaux and Lyon can now be expected to be at the forefront of innovation and experiment in designing greener, cleaner cities for the future. The French president, Emmanuel Macron – whose own party endured a poor election night – has quickly made new environmental commitments in the wake of the results. Mr Macron has promised to provide an extra €15bn to smooth a transition to a low-carbon economy and to implement some of the demands of the citizens’ assembly he convened on the climate emergency. In negotiating bailouts with France’s stricken car and aviation industries, he has demanded stiffer electrification and emissions reduction targets. At a European level, Germany, whose six-month presidency of the EU began this week, is expected to press for more ambitious targets for emissions reductions by 2030. All these developments are welcome. But a crucial aspect of a great night for the Greens in France should not be forgotten. The famous victories were driven by younger voters living in relatively prosperous cities. In much of rural and small-town France, where the gilet jaunes protests were sparked by a fuel tax rise, environmental radicalism is viewed as a luxury option for the well-heeled metropolitan middle classes. Making the case for a green post-Covid-19 recovery, the triumphant new mayor of Lyon, Grégory Doucet, rightly said this week: “Ecology is not the enemy of the economy, it’s its best ally.” But in Europe’s fearful post-industrial heartlands, this is an argument that still needs to be won."
"**A new governor has been sworn into office in Puerto Rico, bringing fresh controversy to the US territory.**
Pedro Pierluisi is the handpicked successor of Ricardo RossellÃ³, who resigned amid mass protests over a leaked chat in which he and top aides shared obscenity-laced messages.
But Mr Pierluisi's term as governor could be short-lived as it is yet to be ratified by the island's Senate.
Critics argue that his appointment is unconstitutional.
In his inaugural speech on Friday, Mr Pierluisi said he was ""fully capable and authorised to act, but the Senate will have its say"".
""If I am not ratified then the second in line, the secretary of justice of Puerto Rico, will take over the governorship,"" he added.
Mr Pierluisi said he did not plan to move into the governor's mansion and would avoid any major changes until after the vote next week.
He was sworn in by a judge at 17:00 local time (21:00 GMT) on Friday - the hour that Mr RossellÃ³ was set to leave office.
Many criticised the move, with Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz describing it as ""unethical and illegal"", according to Reuters news agency.
San Juan Mayor Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz said the municipality would be challenging his swearing-in, while one lawyers' organisation reportedly accused him of ""hijacking"" the constitution.
The appointment on Friday came as crowds celebrated the fall of Mr RossellÃ³.
Mass street rallies in Puerto Rico began after text messages between Mr RossellÃ³ and his team were leaked on 13 July.
Obtained by Puerto Rico's Centre for Investigative Journalism, the text messages span some 900 pages. They were from a group chat that included the governor and 11 of his aides and cabinet members.
The messages include jokes about Hurricane Maria victims along with sexist and homophobic comments.
Mr RossellÃ³ initially apologised but said he would not step down over the scandal. On 24 July, he announced his resignation in a recorded video statement.
""I feel that to continue in this position would make it difficult for the success that I have achieved to endure,"" he said."
"**Google has become the latest US technology giant to invest in Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries' digital business.**
The Alphabet-owned search engine has agreed to pay $4.5bn (Â£3.6bn) for a 7.7% stake in Jio Platforms.
Reliance's billionaire owner Mukesh Ambani says the two companies will develop phones for 4G and 5G networks.
Google joins a list of new investors in Jio that includes Facebook, Intel and Qualcomm.
""Google has empowered millions of Indians to access helpful information and, like Jio, is a force for change and innovation,"" Mr Ambani said in a statement to shareholders.
Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai said: ""The pace and scale of digital transformation in India is hugely inspiring for us and reinforces our view that building products for India first helps us build better products for users everywhere.""
Earlier this week Google also said the company would invest about $10bn in India over the next five to seven years.
In April Facebook said it would invest $5.7bn for a 9.99% stake in Jio, making it the cut-price Indian mobile internet provider's largest minority shareholder.
The investment arms of US technology giants Intel and Qualcomm have also bought smaller smaller stakes in the company.
**Arunoday Mukharji, BBC News, Delhi**
Mr Ambani has been on a shopping spree, managing to hook 11 big investors in the last three months and raising over $20bn.
Not only has it helped him remove his net debt of $21bn, he is now looking to expand in the e-commerce space to rival giants like Amazon in India.
His online venture Jio Mart wants to tap into Facebook-owned Whatsapp's 400 million users in India to connect customers with their nearest mom and pop stores - hugely popular in India.
This is why the $6bn Facebook investment in April becomes even more significant.
Mr Ambani also said his company had developed a fully home-grown 5G network. This is important for two major reasons.
First, it fits the script of Prime Minister Modi's repeated push for a self-reliant India.
Second, and more importantly, it seriously damages prospects of tech giants like China's Huawei, which was looking to participate in India's 5G trials.
In the aftermath of the recent border standoff between India and China, the government has been reconsidering all major business engagements with China.
Jio, which is India's newest major mobile operator, grew rapidly to take the number one spot late last year.
Since launching in September 2016 the low cost service has attracted almost 400m subscribers and aims to increase that figure to 500m in the next three years.
In January Reliance announced that it would launch a grocery delivery service that aimed to compete with Amazon in India.
US technology companies see India as a key market for growth, with the number of internet users there seen rising to more than 850m in 2022, according to consultancy firm PwC.
Mr Ambani, who is the chairman and managing director of Jio's parent company Reliance Industries, is now the world's ninth-richest person, with a net worth of $68.7bn, according to Forbes."

Warmists Take the Hardest Hits
Anyone can be a prophet of doom….
Why can’t the global-warming catastrophe industry convince the public that the scare underwriting its meal ticket is real? Even the CSIRO’s  annual survey last year  showed that 53% of Australians reject the official story. And even on the CSIRO’s figures, Aussies rank climate fourteenth out of sixteen concerns overall, and we rate it only seventh out of eight even among environmental concerns. In Britain, more of the same, with a new survey showing those who describe themselves “very concerned” about climate change falling to 18%, down from 44% in 2005.
Partly to blame is that dratted 18-year halt to global warming, even as man-made CO2 continues to pour into the skies. But my theory is that the global warming industry has made itself so ridiculous over the past 30 years, so hyperventilatingly ludicrous, by predicting ever-more-dire catastrophes by the year 20XX.  But then year 20XX   comes and goes and life continues as normal. …

9th International Conference on Climate Change
Press Release, The Heartland Institute, Mar 17, 2014
http://climateconference.heartland.org/
July 7 – 9 — Las Vegas, Nevada
Includes the Findings of the New Report of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) Climate Change Reconsidered II, Volumes 1, 2, and 3
###################################################
THIS WEEK:
By Ken Haapala, Executive Vice President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP)
NIPCC: More reports from the independent researchers of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) are on the way. Volume 2 of Climate Change Reconsidered II: Biological Impacts is being published and the Summary for Policymakers is available on the web. No doubt this report will be in stark contrast with a report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which covers some of the same material. The main difference is that the NIPCC includes material that the IPCC conveniently ignores. This material emphasizes the large benefits to plant life, the environment, and humanity from enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). If the UN IPCC report follows the patterns of the past, it will contain alarming comments of possible harms far in the future from enhanced atmospheric CO2 – catastrophic anthropogenic (man-made) global warming (CAGW). NIPCC has found no strong evidence that CAGW exists. The UN IPCC used models to make claims of future CAGW. But, the models have never been validated, thus are purely speculative, not scientific. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy.
*************
IPCC: The latest report of the IPCC Working Group II: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerabilities is due to be released on March 31, 2014. Initial leaks indicated that the tone would be moderate compared with the alarmist tone of the last report, which contained many errors of fact, such as the glaciers in the Himalaya Mountains will melt by 2040. However, this optimism may have been premature. Later reports indicate there is a hardening of lines among the alarmists, which is to be expected. Too many politicians, climate scientists, and leaders of Green organizations has staked their reputations of the promotion of CAGW. They will not back down quietly.
One could assesses the demands of the alarmists with the announcement of the Summary for Policymakers for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in October, 2013. Even though the climate models on which predictions of CAGW are failing epically — and that after 35 years of research, after spending tens of billions of dollars, failed to narrow the range of estimated temperature values for a doubling of CO2, controllers of the report insisted they are 95% confident in the findings of the report. An indication that the less alarmist view of the proceedings may not be correct is the resignation of Richard Tol, a convening lead author of the chapter on economics. He requested his name be removed from the report.
In other work, Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, estimated that for most of this century human CO2 emissions will be beneficial to humanity, only causing net harm near the end of the century. Strident alarmists would consider him a heretic. One can only wait to see what dominates the UN IPCC, will it be rigorous science, or raw political power? For a wide range of speculation see links under Problems in the Orthodoxy.
*************
US Exports: Russia’s venture into the Crimea is increasing political calls for opening the US energy markets to exporting oil and natural gas — particularly, exporting natural gas to Europe, lessening dependence on Russian gas. Companies such as Dow argue such actions will raise the cost of natural gas in the US, squashing the only substantial new job growth that is occurring. A study by NERA Economic Consulting, updated in February, shows that the increase in US prices will be minor.
Dow has formed a group called America’s Energy Advantage. This group largely ignores the costs of transporting the natural gas from wellhead in the US to city gate in Europe. NERA estimates these costs, in 2018, will amount to $6.33/Mcf (2012 dollars). The costs include the costs of new pipelines on both ends, liquefaction, shipping, and regasification. Thus, natural gas in the US will have still a significant price advantage over Europe.
Other objections being raised is that it will take too long. It may be too late for the Crimea, but not too late to influence other Russian actions. Some brought up the experience in Greece. When another option to Russian gas appeared, Gazprom renegotiated its prices, lowering them.
There is speculation whether President Obama will encourage oil and gas exports. Perhaps his inaction on the Keystone pipeline is the best indicator. The pipeline requires no government grants or subsidies – just government approvals. It was to bring heavy oil from Canada, the largest US trading partner, to refineries on the Gulf Coast, in part replacing heavy oil from Venezuela, an unreliable source. The southern part of the pipeline has been built. After over five years, the northern part, over which the Administration has control has not been approved. Instead, the Administration; is using it to leverage campaign contributions for the Democratic Party. See Article #3 and links under Energy Issues – Non-US and Washington’s Control of Energy.
*************
Alaska Squeeze: Washington continues to squeeze the oil industry in Alaska, which once provided 10% of the oil consumed by the US. Washington’s policy threatens the Alaskan pipeline. At its peak of 1988, the throughput of the pipeline averaged 2,032,928 bbl. per day. In 2013, the average was 534,480 bbl. per day, a drop of almost 74%. If volume drops to about 300,000 bbl. per day the pipeline will freeze and cannot be restarted. By law, once it stops, this valuable national asset would have to be disassembled.
By continuing to squeeze oil production, Washington is squeezing the budget of Alaska, which depends heavily on royalties from oil. Washington is preventing development the Coastal Plain (ANWR), the National Petroleum Reserve, Indian Lands, and hobbling development of the Chukchi Sea OCS work by Shell. In contrast, Russian is proceeding aggressively with its development of the oil reserves in its portion the Chukchi Sea. One joint ventures includes Shell. Among the Russian fields being explored is one about 40 to 50 miles from Shell’s US leaseholds and about 150 miles from the Russian coast.
US recoverable resources are estimated to be 40 Billion barrels of oil. Congress must decide if a tiny portion of ANWR can be developed, the balance is under the control of the Administration. The Administration refused to permit a 3-D survey of ANWR. The speculation is that the Administration does not want the public to know the extent of the resources that it is locking-up. The State has sued the Federal government on the grounds that, based on an interpretation of the agreement which provided statehood, Alaska has the right to develop oil and national gas on its lands, and Indians have the right to develop oil and natural gas on their lands. It will be interesting to see how the courts interpret this state rights issue.
*************
Japan: In wake of the tsunami that wiped out the cooling pumps of the Fukushima reactor, the government of Japan implemented stringent regulations for nuclear power plants. It appears that many of the nuclear plants shut down after the Fukushima incident will not be reopened because it is uneconomic to modify them to meet the new regulations. Japan’s answer to low-cost base-load electricity is coal. After China, Japan is the second largest importer of coal and may be building more coal-fired power plants. See Article #4.
*************
Regulators on the March: One of the pernicious features of the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act is that they give great power to government agencies to determine the need for regulations, which the same agency then implements. The courts have deferred to the government agencies on the science justifying the expansion of government control. There is no counterbalancing power to the actions of these agencies. Often these actions result in significant costs to private parties that continue to own the land but are subject to government control of its use.
The EPA and the Corps of Engineers have announced the expansion of control of significant amounts of private and state-owned lands under the Clean Water Act. EPA uses broad definitions of waters that it can control, such as leaves made wet from rain are waters of the US. Similarly, US Fish and Wildlife Service uses narrow definitions of species to include minor local adaption of a species to be a separate species. It has announced the lesser prairie chicken as threatened, which will give it control of major sections of five Western states. Several years ago, Fish and Wildlife listed the polar bear as threatened, even though populations are growing. See links under EPA and other Regulators on the March
*************
McIntyre: In 2012, Steven McIntyre filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the University of Western Australia. He was seeking the data behind a survey by Lewandowsky et al. that found that skeptics are conspiracy theorists. According to McIntyre, the survey data was manipulated after the fact. Based on other information received, McIntyre filed for a retraction of the study. University of Western Australia flatly denied request for retraction. Apparently the Vice Chancellor’s feelings were hurt, accusing McIntyre of inflammatory statements and becoming unbalanced on the issue. The university policy is that research data must be available to other researchers. See link under Climategate Continued
*************
Green Revolution: March 25, 2014 marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of Norman Borlaug. He was the primary person responsible for the Green Revolution that greatly expanded food productivity, allowing many farmers to break the shackles of subsistence agriculture.
By way of contrast, March 29, 2014 marked the symbolic effort of the other green revolution to turn off electric lights for one hour. This second green revolution is largely for the wealthy, demanding that those less fortunate not be allowed reliable, affordable electricity provided fossil fuels. See links under Agriculture Issues & Fear of Famine and Environmental Industry.
*************
Number of the Week: 34.2% & 23.3% The Census Bureau reported “Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction industries were the most rapidly growing part of our nation’s economy over the last several years,” From 2007 to 2012 the number of employees rose 23.3 percent to 903,641 and the revenues grew 34.2 percent to $555.2 billion. Of course, most if not all of the growth came from oil and gas extraction, and the data do not reflect the growth in 2013. Also, the data do not reflect the job growth is in service industries and industries that benefit from reliable supplies of oil and low-cost natural gas. This growth is not the result of policies implemented by the current Administration.

"**A post by Donald Trump's official Facebook account purports to show violence in the US but is in fact of an event in another country.**
The advert shows one image of Mr Trump in a calm setting talking to police officers beside another of a security official being surrounded by protesters, saying: ""Public safety vs chaos and violence"".
However, the image is a photo from a pro-democracy protest in Ukraine in 2014.
Facebook have told the BBC they won't be taking any action against the post but gave no further comment.
The post reads ""Evangelicals For Trump are ready to help re-elect President Donald J Trump.""
On the image on the right, the officer is wearing a badge on his shoulder.
However, it is an insignia not recognisable as one US police wear - it's a Coptic cross seen in countries which practice Orthodox Christianity.
Using a reverse image search shows that the image is actually from Ukraine and was first posted in 2014, during the revolution that overthrew the government.
The security official pictured is in fact not a US police officer. That badge was worn by members of the ""Internal Troops of Ukraine"", a now disbanded section of the national military that also assisted with policing.
The image is also on the Wikipedia page about the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution, and says it shows events in February 2014 when security officials clashed with anti-government protesters.
The old photo in the advert was picked up by a former Hillary Clinton staffer Jesse Lehrich in tweet that has been widely shared.
President Trump's Facebook page has more than 30 million followers.
The imagery appears to have been made by campaign group ""Evangelicals for Trump"" and has mostly reached users in Florida and Texas who are older than 55, according to Facebook's estimates.
Social media companies Facebook and Twitter have taken steps in recent months to label posts by public officials.
Facebook has begun labelling posts on the pages of both the president and Joe Biden \- the Democratic Party's nominee for president in November's election - with links to official information.
We have asked Mr Trump's campaign team for a response.

Satire.



 _Once again your intrepid eyewitness, using the infamous fly on the wall technology, and making sure that new batteries were inserted in the artificial insect, was able to listen to, and view, a secret late-night meeting of ‘Kiwiswamp’ also known as the Notional Party’s NINO faction, some 93.5% of the caucus._



Once again, the Right Hon. Solomon Ridges chaired the meeting. He looked around the packed room, filled almost to capacity, due in large part to the presence of the salad-hating, well-fed individual known affectionately as “The Land Whale”. It is said that he never met a pie he didn’t like.



He cleared his throat and began. “Well good evening, fellow Kiwiswamp dwellers, mxn and womxn, theys, thems, thoses, wases, willbys, cross-gendered, left-handed, ambi-dexterous, right-handed, neuter and non-gendered, pregnant and menstruating men, eunuchs, hermaphrodites, woke and super-woke, and if there are any that I’ve missed and are offended by the omission, I will go down on my knees in a pool of raw sewage, wearing a hair-shirt, budgie-smugglers and ballet shoes, and beg forgiveness for my serious lapse in progressive wokeness.” 



“We’ll begin the meeting with our usual call to the swamp. I had intended having that Atheist’s Association chap here again to open with another inspiring prayer, but unfortunately he was prevented from attending by an Act of God. A zero carbon tree unfortunately fell on his car, due to a strong wind caused by Climate Change. He will recover I’m told. We must push for a law change to make such incidents renamed an Act of Mann, or something befitting the Climate Emergency that we all agree is imminently about to annihilate us all, the enlightenment due mainly to the incontrovertible evidence that St. Greta the Great would have presented at the UN if there had been any.”



There then followed the ritual chorus of ribbits, croaks, mosquito-like whining and other noises one associates with swamps, politicians and journalists.



When the din finally subsided, Mr Ridges proceeded. “You will recall that our last meeting addressed the issues raised by Hwmbo George in New York. _[Editor: He who must be obeyed]_ He berated us for being slightly dissimilar to the present Coalition government, and urged us to up our game in order to achieve what he calls parliamentary homogeny. In other words, we must be so like the present Coalition that voters will just vote them back in, realising that nothing will change even if we should be elected.”



A veritable symphony of assent filled the room, as the Swamp dwellers affirmed their unswerving desire to be more like the Losers’ Coalition than the Coalition itself.



“I think,” continued the Chairbeing, “that this week we have made an overwhelming advance in that direction, with our assent to the **Zero Economy** … or rather Zero Carbon Bill. A lot of Notional voters were expecting that we would oppose the bill.” He shook his head pityingly and burst into cackling laughter.



The entire swampy caucus as one man (not forgetting the womxn), broke into a roar of hearty laughter, which echoed and rolled around the room for several minutes. When the last of them collapsed back in their seats wiping the tears from their eyes the chairfellow continued.



“Yes, yes, it’s priceless isn’t it?” he said weakly, wiping the tears from his eyes while supporting himself by leaning on the table. “You’d have thought that our capitulation on the firearms issue would have given them a bit of a hint, wouldn’t you? Well I believe that after our efforts this week, there should be no doubt that voting Notional is a pointless exercise for those wanting any change in the country’s direction. Of course, there are always voters gullible enough to believe that we would change the law within a hundred days as promised.”



Another burst of guffaws filled the room as the Kiwiswamp dwellers reflected on the gullible nature of some of their supporters.



“Of course, even if we were to be elected, there’s no way that Hwmbo George would allow any changes to be made. Not that we’d want to, of course,” he hastened to add. Then his face took on a stern look. “There are still 6.5% of our caucus who have as yet not joined **Kiwiswamp**. We can’t have this. We don’t want these @#$*ing useless members causing damage to the perception that we are completely in line with her Comradeship’s policies. More pressure must be brought to bear on them to join. And I don’t want to hear it said that we will do the same as the Coalition, but do it better. That was a mistake. We must say that we will do the same, but not as well.”



A thunderous round of applause followed this statement, accompanied by foot-stamping and more swamp noises.



When quiet was again restored, one of the newer members of the swamp timidly raised his hand.



“What if a large number of our supporters switch to a minor party and give it more than 5% of the vote?” he asked. “Or maybe two minor parties get more than 5% each? Wouldn’t that cause some problems?”



Mr Ridges fixed the member with a withering red-eyed glare. “Won’t happen,” he barked. “It’s taken care of. The pollsters won’t mention the minor parties that look as though they could be a threat. It’s arranged. And Epstein didn’t kill himself!”



However, his ebullient mood evaporated like fossil fuel in the sun. “I don’t want to hear negative thoughts like that again. This is Kiwiswamp, we don’t do realism here… migosh that’s a gigantic fly…”



 _Unfortunately, at this point, the transmission ceased, as the mechanism that adhered the fly to the wall failed, and the fly flew a couple of metres and crashed onto Solomon Ridges table, whereupon he whacked it with a copy of “Political Leadership for Dummies”. Your intrepid eyewitness wended his way home, already making plans to further miniaturise the fly, while keeping alert for Jacinda’s Kindness and Wellbeing police._

Press Release: **National Party**  




National has supported the Zero Carbon Bill through its final reading, but is **committing to improving the Bill further** should we earn the right to govern in 2020, Leader of the Opposition Simon Bridges says.



“National proposed a series of changes that would have ensured the Bill is in line with National’s climate change principles of taking a pragmatic and science-based approach, but unfortunately **the coalition Government voted down all of our amendments.**



The changes we proposed were:



“We have taken a bipartisan approach to climate change but we will continue to fight for the changes we think will make the law better.



“Should National earn the right to govern in 2020 **we will make these changes in our first 100 days in office.** We will ensure the Bill drives the right long-term changes and factors in the wider impacts on New Zealand’s economy, jobs and incomes.”

Providing the rationale for their work, Roberts _et al_. (2015) write that “the short and sparse instrumental record in the high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere means investigating long-term precipitation variability in this region is difficult without access to appropriate proxy records.” It was therefore the objective of this team of nine researchers to extend the duration of the Law Dome, East Antarctica, snowfall accumulation record back in time an additional 750 years so that it would cover over two millennia.   
  
The resultant 2035 year-long proxy (22 BC to 2012 AD) is presented in the figure below. As reported by the authors, the average long-term snow accumulation rate was calculated as 0.686 m yr-1 (27 inches) ice equivalent, which rate they say “is in agreement with previous estimates, and further supports the notion that there is no long-term trend in snow accumulation rates, or that any trend is constant and linear over the [2035-year] period of measurement.”   
  
If this number seems low for such an icy continent, the fact is that most high-latitude locations in both hemispheres would qualify as deserts based upon annual precipitation. In many places, it is literally “too cold to snow” as the frigid air can hold only tiny amounts of moisture.   
  
There were several decadal-scale oscillations in the record, described by the authors as “common,” with “74 events (33 positive and 41 negative) of at least a 10-year duration in the record.” The three longest periods of _above_ average integrated snowfall occurred over the intervals 380-442, 727-783, and 1970-2009, while the three longest periods of _below_ average integrated snowfall occurred during 663-704, 933-975, and 1429-1468.





_Annual (grey) and smoothed (green) snow accumulation rate history for Law Dome, East Antarctica over the period 22 BC–2012 AD. Adapted from Roberts et al. (2015)._   
  
With respect to the _cause_ of the interannual and decadal variability in the record, Roberts _et al_. report they found no significant correlation between snowfall accumulation and (1) the Southern Oscillation Index, (2) volcanic activity, (3) the Southern Annular Mode or (4) the Law Dome CO2 record. Spectral analysis, however, revealed periodicities that “may be related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) frequencies.”   
  
In considering the above, it is abundantly clear there is nothing unusual, unnatural or unprecedented about present snowfall accumulation rates in this region of the Antarctic. Furthermore, there is nothing to suggest a global warming/CO2-induced influence on this record across the entire time span of the Industrial Revolution, despite a 40% increase in atmospheric CO2. And, lastly, there is no indication the great millennial-scale temperature oscillations that brought the Roman Warm Period, the Dark Ages Cold Period, the Medieval Warm Period, the Little Ice Age, and the Current Warm Period, had any effect on the snowfall record either. Thus, it seems safe to conclude that, in the forseeable future, annual snowfall accumulation totals will likely continue much as they have for the past 2035 years, never straying too far (or too long) from their long-term mean, unaffected by changes in CO2 or temperature.

"**Puerto Rico's Justice Secretary Wanda VÃ¡zquez has been sworn in as the US territory's new governor, hours after her predecessor was forced to stand down by the Supreme Court.**
She is the third politician to occupy the post in less than a week.
Ricardo Rossello resigned on Friday after street protests prompted by the leak of offensive messages.
His replacement, Pedro Pierluisi, was removed by the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds after five days.
Ms VÃ¡zquez has promised to bring political stability to Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria two years ago.
She had publicly stated that she was not interested in becoming governor but was next in line to Mr Pierluisi, according to the constitution.
In a statement released after her swearing-in, she said she was assuming office ""with the greatest respect and determination to serve my people and to push Puerto Rico forward"".
Her inauguration came after Supreme Court justices ruled that as the Senate had never confirmed Mr Pierluisi, ""the assumption of the office of governor was unconstitutional"".
Mr Pierluisi has called for unity and urged Puerto Ricans to discard ""political-partisan, ideological or personal agendas"".
Mr RossellÃ³ had been at the centre of a group text message scandal that had already led two top officials to resign.
The leaked messages revealed sexist, profane and homophobic comments.
The chat, which contained 880 pages of exchanges between the governor and 11 male allies, was leaked on 13 July and led to days of protests outside the governor's mansion in San Juan."
"**""If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with executive orders.""**
Those were US President Donald Trump's words on Wednesday shortly before the leaders of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook were quizzed by Congress.
That word ""fairness"" is crucial when it comes to the future regulation of these tech titans. That's because, in the mouths of different lawmakers, fairness means very different things.
""These companies, as they exist today, have monopoly power... some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated.""
Those were the closing remarks of David Cicilline, chairman of the House judiciary committee's anti-trust sub-committee.
For him, fairness means not just clipping the wings of Big Tech, but fundamentally restructuring their relationship with Americans.
Cicilline was one of many lawmakers who came out swinging. At one point he asked Amazon's Jeff Bezos why the company had been compared to a drug dealer.
This being American politics, there was also - of course - a partisan split.
Republicans like Jim Jordan and Matt Gaetz had a different interpretation of fairness - and it had nothing to do with anti-trust.
""I'll just cut straight to the chase. Big Tech's out to get conservatives,"" said Jordan.
Much of their ire centred around claims of censorship, specifically that Facebook and Google unfairly discriminate against conservatives.
President Trump has suggested likewise. He's already criticised Twitter and Facebook for removing conservative content and even flagging his own posts and tweets.
This split makes predicting how the US might try to lasso these tech giants difficult.
Republicans are generally against market regulation, against increasing red tape.
Many Democrats however believe that these companies are acting like cartels - that they're hurting ""mom and pop"" businesses. That tougher legislation will protect consumers.
The sub-committee will publish its recommendations - and then it's down to lawmakers on Capitol Hill.
It's highly unlikely though that anything much will happen before the US elections in November.
As well as the presidential vote, all the seats in the House of Representatives are up for grabs, as well as about a third of the Senate.
And so we reach a fork in the road for Big Tech in America.
A Republican win would probably see the tech giants scrutinised further over how they police free speech. Section 230 - which gives social media companies immunity from prosecution for what is published on their platforms - would probably be looked at.
If the Democrats win, expect more regulation in an attempt to inject more competition into the tech industry.
In reality though, it's unlikely to be that black and white.
There are Republicans that have sympathies for some of the anti-competition arguments, for example.
The accusations around Amazon hurting tens of thousands of small American businesses is a Republican concern as much as a Democrat one.
There may be bipartisan compromises around anti-competition that are palatable to both sides.
But it's hard to avoid the conclusion that whoever wins the next election, Big Tech is going to get whacked. The question is how and by whom."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMichael Mann’s and Stefan Rahmstorf’s recent AMOC paper has been promptly and widely discredited since it came out, see here WUWT, WUWT, and NTZ. The sharp criticism has since picked up.
Veteran meteorologist Joe Bastardi for example blasted the paper in a comment at WUWT, calling the claims “nonsense” and reminded that renowned climatology expert William Gray had predicted what is now happening already 40 years ago.
Bastardi wrote that it is all part of the natural end-game of the Atlantic’s warm cycle. The veteran meteorologist rated the paper’s claims:
This idea borders on delusional, an attempt to self verify the idea that co2 is actually influencing the oceans, laughable since the heat capacity of the oceans is 1000x air, and co2 is only .04% of the air.”
Curry calls the paper’s methodology “remarkable”
The latest high profile climate scientist criticizing the work is Georgia Tech climatologist Judith Curry at her Climate Etc. site here. First she is unconvinced of the paper’s methodology of using climate model simulations and “Mannian proxy analysis” of decadal to millennial scale ocean circulations and internal variability in place of direct measurements, calling it “remarkable”.

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




She poses the rhetorical question:
So, who you gonna believe? Climate models and Mannian proxies, or direct and satellite observations of ocean circulation?
AMO is behind the changes
Curry says that the cooling of the high latitude North Atlantic can be traced back to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), which now appears to be at the start of its descent into its cool phase. She writes there is some evidence that the warm phase of the AMO already peaked circa 2007. Moreover she hints that the transition could be sharp, as was the case in the late 1990s.
Curry scoffs at the notion that climate change is likely behind the cooling of the North Atlantic. In her summary she writes (my emphasis).
What we are seeing in the high latitudes of the North Atlantic is natural variability, predominantly associated with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Based open observational analyses, there is no sign of a slowdown in the Gulf Stream or the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.
Now, I am very interested in the AMO, since it strongly influences Atlantic hurricanes, Arctic sea ice, and Greenland climate.  We are already seeing a recovery of the Atlantic sector of the Arctic sea ice, and some hints of cooling in Greenland.”

Press Release: **New Conservative**



We are destroying our economy and making no difference to our ecology through carbon trading. This is poor governance and must stop. The beaches we visited forty years ago are the same now as they were then, we are not drowning, our seas are not encroaching and, even if they were, paying $25 PT for carbon will not stop them.



“New Conservative would remove New Zealand from the Paris Agreement 2015, stop the wasteful ETS and concentrate on pollution reduction rather than carbon control,” says Leighton Baker, Party Leader.



“Carbon is an essential element for life and the climate hysteria over its alleged catastrophe causing characteristics is unwarranted, unnecessary and counterproductive.”



New Conservative’s plan for the environment is practical, sensible, achievable and sustainable:



“The net zero carbon bill will have net zero benefits.. Dump it now and act practically for our environment,” says Baker.

Dear Editor



 _This is a letter I have sent to our local MP. I just cant believe how the National Party have been suckered by this climate change bulldust._



So National has supported the coalition’s Zero Carbon bill. I am so disappointed. Prior to the industrial revolution, except for the ruling elite, the normal state of human existence was perpetual poverty where people had nothing and eked out a living the best way they could. It was fossil fuels along with capitalism, property rights and liberty that enabled the industrial revolution to come about. It is the industrial revolution, capitalism and liberty that has given us the prosperous and high standard of living we enjoy today in enzed. 



Isn’t it the objective of the Zero Carbon bill to reduce the use of fossil fuels with the end goal to eliminate it and replace it with renewable energy? Won’t this bill give the state the power to dictate to business and others how they get to carry out their activities? Without an affordable and reliable source of energy our way of life as we know it will grind to a halt and we will go back to living as the people in the 15th century did; as poor peasants, while the ruling elite live like kings.



This climate change bulldust is a good excuse for the coalition of communists who are running this country (into the ground), to impose state control with regulations, taxes and the expansion of the state. Where the state dictates how we get to live, what we can and can’t do, where we no longer own our own lives and need permission from the state to exist, all in the name of ” **climate change** ”, with the National party willingly supporting this journey down the road to serfdom. 



The National party **needs to revisit its 1936 founding principles**. They were sound then and are sound now. The National party needs to compare the aftermath of the American revolution and the aftermath of the Russian revolution. The US created the constitution based on capitalism, individual rights and liberty, where endeavour and success was encouraged and the US became the greatest nation on earth. The Russians on the other hand, introduced state control and communism, just as the coalition would like to do, which turned the Soviet union into a poverty stricken concentration camp. When the Soviet union collapsed it was found to be one of the most polluted nations on earth. **I just can’t believe how left wing and socialist the National party has become.**



Don W.

Video of the session 2 follows.

The committee for Energy and Climate Change must be in line for an award. Its performance this week was exceptional.
The mental level of Yeo’s committee is – well, the climate debate is so rancorous let’s try for decorum.
Suffice it to say that John Robertson’s questioning would have been a credit to a clever dugong. Albert Owen nearly grasped the idea that that a Greenpeace activist in charge of an IPCC Chapter might lack objectivity. And Tim Yeo’s chairing was as good as a golf club captain in a Saturday night lock-in.
The committee had just received three mainstream climate workers and now, to say they had looked at all sides, they had three sceptics.   
No doubt their sceptical remarks are contentious, their facts arguable and their conclusions unusual – but the three of them certainly gave the lie to the claim that “the science is settled”.
Richard Lindzen, a professor at MIT, in his low-key, diffident manner, looked placidly into the committee’s apocalyptic future. How that annoyed them.
The Chairman asked a number of leading. loaded or frankly loopy questions .
Such as:
“So, you think the report should be compiled on a more slipshod basis?”
And:
“Are you saying the Government is deliberately appointing scientists who aren’t as good as others?”
And, here’s an exchange worth quoting at length.
Yeo pressed Lindzen to get a Yes to the question, “Was 2000 to 2010 the hottest decade on record?”
Lindzen: (Eventually) Of course it was.
Yeo: It’s interesting you’re using that as evidence that somehow global warming has stopped. That we’ve just gone through the hottest decade of all time (sic) and that this is actually evidence that global warming is not taking place.
Lindzen: You’re saying something that doesn’t make sense.
Yeo: Oh, so it is continuing!
Lindzen: How shall I put it? On a certain smoothing level you can say it’s continuing. It hasn’t done anything for 15 years.
Yeo: Except we’ve just had the hottest-ever (sic) decade . . . If I was clocked driving my car at 90 mph, faster than I’d ever driven it before, I don’t find that convincing evidence I haven’t broken the 70mph speed limit.
It dawns on Lindzen the chairman has special needs. He explains how a 16-year smoothing average means one thing, how a pause and plateau means another.
Yeo responds: Just because we’ve had the hottest decade on record doesn’t seem conclusive proof that global warming has come to an end.
After a chorus of contradiction:
Yeo: I thought Professor Lindzen was saying the upward trend has come to an end.
Lindzen: (quite sharply, for him) No! I never said it’s come to an end! I said for 16 years it hasn’t increased!
Yeo: I don’t think we’ll get much further on this. I’m happy to be judged by what’s on the record.
I bet he won’t be.
Read more here: SKETCH: Unsettling the “Settled Science” of Climate Change
Now compare that with what the execrable Bob Ward ( who’s paid by “Big Climate” to have an opinion, unlike Donna Laframboise who paid her own way there, and asked for help from the skeptic community to defray travel costs) had to say about it:
For example, Donna Laframboise, the world’s leading producer of conspiracy theories about the IPCC, was asked by Mr Stringer why she thought the organisation should be abolished. Her reply was extremely misleading: “When the IAC [InterAcademy Council] reported in 2010 it said that there were significant shortcomings in every major step of the IPCC process. That is not a mild criticism. That suggests that there are serious reasons to be very careful about the conclusions of the IPCC process.”
Conspiracy theories? He must be talking to Cook and Lew. Ward’s rant, complete with all the denigrating labels necessary for his craft, is here: http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/Media/Commentary/2014/Jan/Blog-on-Select-Committee-Hearing.aspx

1pm AEDT: 31st December 2013
Helicopter to rescue passengers from Russian vessel in Antarctica
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority’s (AMSA) Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC Australia) was advised this morning by the Aurora Australis that the ship will not be able to reach the MV Akademik Shokalskiy.
The Aurora Australis advised RCC Australia it would be at risk of becoming beset by ice itself if it continued to make further rescue attempts.
The Aurora Australis made attempts yesterday to reach the MV Akademik Shokalskiy but was driven back into open waters due to adverse weather conditions such as winds up to 30 knots and snow showers resulting in poor visibility. The ship is currently located about 16 nautical miles east of the Russian vessel.
The helicopter on board the Chinese flagged vessel Xue Long will now be used to rescue the passengers from the MV Akademik Shokalskiy.

This rescue will be a complex operation involving a number of steps and subject to factors such as weather.
The helicopter is unable to fly in the current weather conditions, and will hold off on the rescue until conditions improve. Weather conditions are unlikely to start improving until tomorrow and decisions related to carrying out the rescue may be made at short notice.
In preparation for the rescue, an area for the helicopter to land has been marked on the ice near the MV Akademik Shokalskiy.
RCC Australia has been advised that all 52 passengers will leave the MV Akademik Shokalskiy. All 22 crew members are expected to remain with the vessel.
The passengers are expected to be rescued by helicopter in groups of 12 and will be initially transported to the Xue Long. The Aurora Australis will then use its barge to transfer all 52 passengers on board their vessel. The barge can take up to 22 people at a time.
RCC Australia continues to coordinate the incident and is in regular contact with all vessels involved and continues to monitor the situation. The vessels involved are also in close contact with each other via VHF radio.
The search and rescue operation commenced on Christmas morning AEDT after the Falmouth Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC) in the United Kingdom received a distress message via satellite from the MV Akademik Shokalskiy. The distress message and subsequent coordination of the incident was passed to RCC Australia, who is the responsible search and rescue authority for this area.

"**Video of nesting baby owls was temporarily removed by Facebook for apparently breaking rules on nudity and sexual activity, the page's owner said.**
The live stream was set up by Graham Moss, who started sharing cute pictures of the owls in his Doncaster garden during the coronavirus lockdown.
He claimed his Brockholes Wildlife Diary's (sic) page was blocked despite having no inappropriate content.
While the page has been reinstated Mr Moss has yet to receive an explanation.
Facebook said it was ""currently investigating the removal of this post"".
A spokesman added: ""If people believe their content has been removed in error, they can appeal be clicking the 'Request Review' option.""
More stories from around Yorkshire
Mr Moss said more than 500 people had been enjoying his stream and footage, and described its temporary removal as ""ridiculous"".
The live stream was removed twice, for about 48 hours each time.
He said he had tried to contact Facebook but had not been able to reach anyone.
""I went on to my site to see how many visits the adult owls had been making into the box to feed the chicks, and the footage had gone,"" he said.
""In its place was a message stating the stream had been removed because it breached community standards on adult nudity and sexual activity.""
Mr Moss, who has been self-isolating since 5 March, set up the webcams to enable others to see something ""they wouldn't normally see"".
A second page, monitoring kestrels, has been unaffected, he said.
""When they took the streams off, the site was awash with comments, it was unbelievable.
""Facebook gave me two options, either to agree with the decision or disagree, so obviously I disagreed.
""I thought it would sort itself out and they would see it for what it is: a wildlife site filled with badgers, foxes and whatever.
""It's crazy. The only thing I can imagine is that somebody has maliciously reported the site, I can't even begin to imagine why.""
There were originally six chicks but four died when their parents were unable to hunt in the wet and windy conditions.

Given that we’re in the midst of a [Climate Emergency](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/06/auckland-councillors-declare-climate-emergency/), [Indians are demanding to bring their entire villages here ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/shane-jones-is-dead-right-they-can-always-leave-if-they-dont-like-the-rules/)and Christopher Luxon has been [selected to stand for Botany](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/11/luxon-for-botany-yay/), I couldn’t help wondering where the “Stuffed” headline came from.



I must have been living under a rock somewhere because I was completely unaware that anybody had even asked the question, never mind determined what New Zealanders want. Indeed, I’d go so far as to suggest that by and large, most people haven’t thought about it, have little interest in it and don’t much care what happens as long as it doesn’t cost them anything.



So who exactly is this “lobby group” that thinks the Broadcasting Minister needs an option for a question we didn’t even know he was asking?



The group is BPM, the Better Public Media Trust. Yes, I know, I’ve asked around. Surveyed some friends and acquaintances. The headline from my survey reads: **“Completely Unknown Lobby Group Produces Completely Useless Survey”**. Margin of error +/- zero percent and 100% of the sample had never heard of BPM. Surprise surprise.



The survey was conducted by Research New Zealand _on line_ : “based on a nationally representative sample of n=1000 adult New Zealanders interviewed in late October 2019 through New Zealand’s largest online panel provider (Dynata).”



Suggesting people are being “interviewed” when they are in fact responding to an on line questionnaire, no matter how scientific, is stretching it a bit don’t you think?



Those selected as part of the sample get to choose one of five options: “Strongly Disapprove”, “Disapprove”, “Neutral”, “Approve” or “Strongly Approve” to questions like: “How much do you approve or disapprove of each of the following statements about free to air television?” and they’re offered statements like: “Turn TV One into an ad free channel and web site” or “Remove ads from TV One on weekends” and so it goes on.



If you’re interested, the detailed results of the survey are on the BPM web site. Please don’t all rush there together or you’ll crash their site (/sarc).



Sarcasm aside, there’s always been a group of people here hell bent on pushing the concept of quality public broadcasting. Of course the word “quality” is very subjective and often really means “stuff I like or agree with”. I wish them well and hope they succeed in getting what they want with only one proviso: That they don’t look to me and the rest of New Zealand to pay for them to have that privilege. In other words – user pays.



We currently have public radio and the numbers speak for themselves. RNZ National’s audience share among all radio stations in New Zealand is 11.1% and RNZ Concert (when did you last listen to either?) is 3.8% (looks like you haven’t been). All of us pay for that. Is it value for money? Is it something government should be involved with? Why not have KIWI TV with Twyford in charge?

"We are living in a time of environmental anger and despair, and not without cause. Exponential growth of human consumption has led to catastrophic losses of habitats and the decimation and extinction of species. Covid-19, itself a symptom of a world out of ecological balance, has brought not only human tragedy, but also the loss of 2020 as a biodiversity and climate “super year” for planetary assessments and action. The fleeting good environmental news from the shutdown, of wildlife emerging from hiding places and an early precipitous drop in greenhouse gas emissions, has been replaced by a flood of single-use plastics, an outbreak of poaching and deforestation, and attacks on environmental regulations. It is no wonder, then, that grief is so prevalent among people such as ourselves, who work to protect wildlife and habitats. In one popular, albeit simplified, representation of the stages of grieving, initial denial is replaced by anger, bargaining, depression, and ultimately acceptance. Most environmentalists are well past the denial stage, but expressions of anger and depression abound, which nurtures a culture of negativity. This is often expressed as scepticism, criticism or rejection of research reporting positive outcomes for the environment whenever recovery is partial, pressures remain, or data is incomplete (which is almost always the case). In other words, as Voltaire argued against 250 years ago, we make the perfect the enemy of the good.  In its extreme form, negativity among environmentalists represents a denial that positive outcomes are possible. This stance renders the narrative of a broken biosphere into self-fulfilling prophecy, as ecologist Roger Bradbury exemplified in the New York Times in 2012: “It’s past time to tell the truth about the state of the world’s coral reefs … there is no hope of saving the[m].” Acceptance of a person’s death can be the final stage of grief, but acceptance should not be the last stage for environmental losses that can and must be avoided, and that can often be reversed. In the ocean, for example, I, along with colleagues, recently demonstrated that many ecosystems and species could be rebuilt by 2050 if people worked together to repair the damage and stabilise the climate. Our identification of a growing number of successes in marine conservation, often rooted in policies and actions adopted decades ago, received a rapid backlash from some colleagues who criticised our evidence-based positivity as complacent optimism. Today, the focus of many conservationists on returning ecosystems to some past, idealised state fails to consider that ecosystems are constantly changing and must adapt as conditions shift, both from human pressures as well as natural events. Understanding of past states is crucial to keep ambition high, but conservation must be forward-looking and pragmatic. Indeed, our assessment that marine life can be largely rebuilt by 2050 was put forward as a “great challenge”, one that will require major efforts and a tenacious commitment to expand effective protection of ocean space and species, remove pollution, harvest wisely and tackle the climate crisis. This is not a pipe dream. For evidence, one only has to look to the rapid and massive changes coupled with extraordinary acts of generosity and reciprocation in response to Covid-19, which are themselves embedded within the dynamics of social movements for broader systemic change. Across the globe, the Black Lives Matter movement has galvanised action for laws that prevent further losses of black lives and opportunities. A year ago, young people raised their voices across the world to remind policymakers and society that urgent action, not acceptance, must be deployed to achieve climate stability. Women have united in the #MeToo movement to fight discrimination and abuse. These movements are linked by a common thread: the realisation that justice, across races, gender and generations, is an imperative for a better world and that action must replace acceptance. The world grieves for lost lives and the economic devastation caused by the pandemic. Yet, when the world returns to consider this year’s reboot of global environmental goals, the operating assumptions that confined previous conservation efforts must change. Recovery must be green (and blue, for a healthy ocean) and it must be just, benefiting all. We should not simply dust off plans to address environmental problems from 2020; this crisis is a springboard for bolder solutions to rebuild biodiversity and ecosystems and reverse the effects of the climate emergency. There are already promising signs: a quarter of the EU stimulus package in response to the coronavirus crisis, totalling $826bn (£655bn), will be set aside for climate-friendly measures, such as clean energy technologies and transportation and sustainable land use. Biodiversity conservation and restoration must also be targeted to restore the ecological filters and barriers that shelter humans from future disease transmission from wildlife. As the singer Joan Baez said: “Action is the antidote to despair.” Carlos M Duarte is Tarek Ahmed Juffali research chair of Red Sea ecology at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOne of the biggest miscalculations that the global warming alarmists have made is claiming that global CO2 emissions must reach their peak by 2020 and then begin falling rapidly. If they don’t, there will be no chance of reaching the 2°C maximum warming target. Planetary catastrophe will ensue, the alarmists claim.
British energy behemoth BP has just released its BP Energy Outlook 2035, and it states in no uncertain terms that there is no chance of CO2 emissions beginning their decline by 2035, let alone 2020!
Good news: global GDP to double!
The BP reports states, “By 2035, the world’s population is projected to reach 8.7 billion, which means an additional 1.6 billion people will need energy.” and the globe’s “GDP is expected to more than double“.
That’s good news for humanity. More people enjoying the one-time gift of life and doing so in greater comfort. But that’s going to require energy, of course.
India 3rd largest economy in 2035
The BP report projects that India will go from being a third world country to being the world’s third largest economy.
That has major implications for the world’s energy market. The BP writes (my emphasis):
Primary energy consumption increases by 37% between 2013 and 2035, with growth averaging 1.4% p.a.. Virtually all (96%) of the projected growth is in the non-OECD, with energy consumption growing at 2.2% p.a.. OECD energy consumption, by contrast, grows at just 0.1% p.a. over the whole period and is actually falling from 2030.”
That’s strong growth, and today’s renewable energy technology will have no chance of economically meeting that kind of demand. Wind and solar are just too unreliable, and their storage is still a long way from being feasible. This is glaringly obvious in the BP report.
No end in sight for fossil fuel growth
The BP report features the following chart showing the breakdown of primary fuel consumption by 2035.

The above figure foresees massive expansion of the traditional carbon based fossil fuels, especially oil and gas, with modest growth in coal consumption. That means global CO2 emissions will continue growing strongly, which would mean bad news if the CO2 greenhouse theory were correct. But so far, despite the massive rise in global CO2 emissions since the year 2000, global temperatures have not risen at all, and global warming scientists are now under extreme pressure to revise downwards their once lofty warming projections.
Emissions well above path recommended by scientists!
The future development of CO2 emissions bodes extremely ill for global warming alarmists. The BP Report writes on page 85: “Global CO2 emissions from energy use grow by 25% (1% p.a.) over the Outlook. Emissions remain well above the path recommended by scientists, illustrated by the IEA’s “450 Scenario”. In 2035, CO2 emissions are 18 billion tonnes above the IEA’s 450 Scenario.”
CO2 theory rapidly approaching its Waterloo
CO2 emissions growth clearly is not going to be curbed anytime soon, and temperatures really will have to start climbing in earnest if the AGW theory is to survive. (Un)fortunately there are no signs that is going to happen in the next 10-20 years.
Only 8% renewable energy by 2035
Page 14 of the BP Report shows strong growth in renewable energy, but it will be only about 8% of global energy supply. That’s light year’s away from the UN’s 50% target! Obviously, no one except a few token countries are taking renewable energies seriously. Their impracticality is their major obstacle.
On page 17 the BP states that “coal remains the dominant fuel, accounting for more than a third of the inputs to power generation.”
Planet awash in energy
The report shows a planet that is awash in energy and also projects strong growth in “new energy forms” such as shale and oil sands (p. 20) which “are thought to be abundant”. On page 95 the report states (my emphasis):
North America’s oil and natural gas supply outlook has been revised higher yet again (14%) due to the continued evolving expectations for shale gas and tight oil.”
The BP report summarizes on page 97:
Our Outlook shows more growth in non-OECD energy demand than the IEA NP; it also shows more growth for fossil fuels, especially for coal. This probably reflects differing views on the outlook for rapidly industrializing economies, in particular on the speed with which they can move to a less energy-intensive growth path.”

Ronald H. Coase was one of the most interesting and influential economists of his century. He was born in 1910 in a suburb of London and recently passed away at the age of 102 in Chicago, close to the economics department that he, Milton Friedman, George Stigler, and so many others helped elevate into the intellectual stratosphere.



Coase’s insights were few but great — which deservedly earned him a Nobel Prize in economics in 1991. His dissertation about why firms exist started an entire field of economic inquiry continued by Oliver Williamson who himself won a Nobel Prize in 2009. His paper, “The Federal Communications Commission,” eventually influenced governments around the world to sell or lease some bands of the electro‐​magnetic spectrum. He poked fun at economic orthodoxy by showing that public goods, like lighthouses, were provided by private methods rather than through the government as had been assumed earlier.



His most influential paper was “The Problem of Social Cost,” published in the _Journal of Law and Economics_ in 1960. As of 2012, it was still the most cited law review article. The insights of the paper are simple but to understand how revolutionary they are, you must understand what preceded Coase’s paper.



 **Pre‐​Coase**



Economists have been grappling with externalities for over a century. Externalities are costs or benefits imposed by an individual without their consent. Economists were mostly worried about negative externalities, those that harmed others. A common example is a factory that makes it impossible for a neighboring dry cleaner to clean clothes. The factory’s emissions of soot dirty the clothes in the dry cleaner, imposing a significant cost even though they are not interacting voluntarily with the factory.



Using pollution as an example, if negative externalities are imposed on outsiders then polluters will over‐​pollute. If polluters had to bear the entire cost of their pollution then they would pollute less or until the costs of cleaning up the pollution or just suffering through it is equal to the profit of producing the last widget. But if the costs of pollution are mainly borne by others, the polluter will make more widgets and thus pollute more than he otherwise would — imposing higher costs on others.



Until 1960 the accepted to solution to this problem was a Pigouvian Tax, named after British economist Alfred Cecil Pigou. His idea was simple on the surface but more complex in practice. A Pigouvian Tax would be a tax levied on the polluter. Ideally, the tax would be equal to the harm caused by the pollution, thus internalizing the costs of the pollution to the polluter. In such a situation, the polluter will more carefully evaluate the costs and benefits of extra polluting, decreasing the quantity of pollution. The Pigouvian Tax can also be used to justify command and control style regulations to mandate lower emissions, similar to the Environmental Protection Agency’s actions.





Coase’s insights help illuminate the potential bargains and costs of immigration.



A tax on a polluting firm decreases the supply of widgets the firm makes and decreases its pollution through that mechanism. Greg Mankiw of Harvard started a Pigou Club of economists who support carbon taxes. Ideally, a carbon tax would allow the government to impose a cost on firms that would internalize the harm caused by carbon dioxide and create a financial incentive for the firm to innovate or adopt other production techniques to minimize the externality. Those externality reducing technologies or techniques are usually more expensive, otherwise the firm would already be employing them, so they decrease output. The cost of pollution is borne by the polluter through taxes and thus decreasing the production of widgets.



That seems like a simple idea on the surface but it hides an underlying complexity that makes the Pigouvin Tax an unwieldy intervention. One problem is, how much should the firm be taxed? Pigouvians will say, “set the tax equal to the negative externality.” How much does an externality cost? Are the costs uniformly imposed? Witness the intense disagreement over a carbon tax. Some disagree that carbon dioxide is even a pollutant, others think it causes harm but via natural emissions rather than human production processes. Others think human production of carbon dioxide imposes small costs on other people so it’s not worth taxing while other think the tax is large. Also, different emitters of carbon dioxide has disparate impacts on the environment based on their location, the height of smoke stacks, and other issue complex environmental factors.



Without weighing in on the climate science or other economic issues surrounding the withering debate over carbon taxes, it is difficult to determine whether there should be a Pigouvian Tax or, if economists think there should be one, how big it should be. A one cent tax per ton of carbon dioxide might not even cover the cost of collection while a $100,000 a ton tax imposes too high of a cost on producers.



The government is unable to determine an efficient tax rate to internalize the costs of production. Government agents have their own motivations and incentives that do not coincide with creating efficient Pigouvian Tax rates. Politicians want to get elected, which means they could support tax rates based on their constituent’s desires. Those constituents will have complex incentives that have little to do with finding a tax level that minimizes the costs of pollutions to an efficient level. Some bureaucrats will want higher taxes to extend their revenue while others will think it weakens their control if taxes replace command and control regulations. If a tax is imposed on carbon dioxide and it turns out to be based on a faulty understanding of the science of climate change, the government will not surrender a large source of revenue. Public choice theory strikes again.



Not all externalities should be eliminated. In an extreme example, a factory produces goods that create $1 trillion in profits but imposes a $100 negative externality on a neighboring business. In order to eliminate that $100 in pollution, the factory would have to shut down. The efficient solution is clearly not to destroy $1 trillion in profits to protect $100 worth of property elsewhere. Internalizing all of the costs there would impose far greater damage than that done by the pollution. Very few people argue for eliminating all externalities but thinking in terms of these types of extremes help clarify marginal thinking.



 **The Coase Theorem**



Pigou’s approach, problems and all, were embraced by the economics profession until Coase’s paper in 1960. The Coase Theorem, dubbed by George Stigler, is best explained through examples.



Returning to the factory and the dry cleaner example earlier, the Pigouvin solution would be to tax the factory so its emissions decrease, allowing the dry cleaner to operate. The Coase Theorem states that under certain circumstances, bargains and exchanges can reduce negative externalities by efficiently exchanging property rights between the polluter and polluted. In this case, they can change their behaviors or exchange resources to decrease the damage of an externality or compensate those harmed.



The factory could decrease its emissions but the dry cleaner could also move or install an expensive air filter. The problem is not just the firm’s emissions but also the dry-cleaner’s location. The dry cleaner could pay the factory to decrease emissions or the factory could compensate the dry cleaner.



The Coase Theorem says that when the costs of negotiating are zero and both parties have property rights, they will reach the least expensive solution and most efficient solution to the externality problem. Let’s say the factory made $1 million in profits a year while the dry cleaner would make $50,000 without the pollution. With the pollution, the dry cleaner’s profits are $0. A Pigouvin Tax would decrease the factory’s profits by $100,000 and let the dry cleaner make $50,000. That means that there is $50,000 less in total profit.



A Coasean bargain could produce a better solution for both parties. The factory owner could buy the dry cleaner a $50,000 air filter so it could still clean clothes and the firm could still pollute. In that situation, the total amount of profit has not decreased and, without the tax, the externality of the pollution was decreased. Since both parties have a better understanding of their own costs and how much pollution could be produced while allowing them both to operate, they are much more likely to reach a mutually beneficial bargain than having one imposed on them by the government.



There are two conditions that are important for Coasean bargains like these to be struck. The first is that transaction costs need to be zero or negligible to allocate all property rights in a way to adjust negative externalities down to an efficient level. When transaction costs are positive, as they always are in the real world, the cost of finding the polluter and victim, negotiating, and enforcing a solution need to be less than or equal to the benefits of the bargain. If those transaction costs are too great, the a Coasean bargain will not occur.



Many Coasean bargains that would decrease externalities cannot be struck in the real world due to those transaction costs. Bilateral monopoly problems, market power, and government rules and regulations raise transaction costs and thus decrease the quantity of bargains that can be struck.



An essential component of Coase’s insight on transaction costs is that courts, governments, manners and norms, or other civil institutions can help lower transaction costs and aid both parties in reaching a mutually beneficial and socially efficient bargain. Indeed, many of those institutions evolve to facilitate Coasean bargaining — which is what many claim is Coase’s most interesting insight. The bundle of rights in Anglo‐​Saxon property law, easements and servitudes, and tort actions against trespass and nuisance all serve to decrease the transaction costs of reaching Coasean bargains.



Property rights are also important for the Coase theorem. Both the factory and the dry cleaner need to own their property and be free to exchange it in order to find a bargain. Instead of an air filter, the factory could buy the property from the dry cleaner and essentially pay for him to move far enough away so the costs of pollution won’t be borne by him.



One of the main insights here is that if property rights are secure and transferrable and transaction costs are low, people will exchange property and make Coasean bargains to decrease the net‐​cost of negative externalities to the point where the benefits of pollution equal the costs. Pollution will not disappear, it will decrease or change to the point where the last bit of pollution produced will be equal to the economic value of the last good produced.



The Coase Theorem explains behavior in numerous situations from cattle herders in Northern California to railroad companies in the Rocky Mountains to property developers in Arizona. Even when property rights are relatively insecure, Coasean bargains are discovered. In a paper Pete Leeson and I wrote in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, we discovered that Coasean solutions were even reached in low transaction cost situations where property rights were insecure — like the interaction between privateers and merchantmen on the high seas in the 18th and 19th centuries.



In arriving at Coasean bargains, the main problems are the transaction costs and not necessarily the externality. If the costs of eliminating the externality are greater than the costs of dealing with it, then nothing should be done.



 **The Coase Theorem and Immigration**



Immigration is a topic where the Coase theorem could be profitably applied to increase understanding but seldom is because the costs of explaining it (see above) are so high. Most of the complaints of immigration restrictionists focus on the supposed externalities caused by immigrants. Viewed through a Coasean framework, immigration restrictions are the most damaging and expensive ways to decrease the supposed externalities of immigration. Either other policies should be crafted to deal with the externalities, nothing should be done, or the externalities are likely positive.



Restrictionists often complain about immigrants who bring a different language with them.



“There are now Spanish newspapers that are going beyond the level of amateur ethnic press and becoming serious professional media operations in the United States that operate in another language,” said Mark Krikorian of the restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies. “That kind of thing is only possible because of mass immigration of large numbers.” Krikorian’s solution is stricter immigration controls and removing the unauthorized immigrants already here.



Different languages have always worried Americans. Benjamin Franklin even fretted that the Germans could overrun Pennsylvania and replace English.



Immigrants from the developing world earn incomes three to fifteen times as great as in their home countries. Each additional immigrant in a city increases the housing prices in that city by $.12 cents, redistributing some economic gains to American property owners. Immigration from 1990 to 2006, at worst, decreased wages for a quarter of Americans by around 3 percent but raised them by over 1 percent for 75 percent of Americans. Most economists have found that the incomes for virtually all Americans have increased over that time period because of immigration.



If we forced unauthorized immigrants and other legal immigrants to leave, their incomes would decrease by at least 67 to 93 percent, American property values would fall, and most Americans would likely see a decrease in wage growth or an actual decline. Barring future immigration would trap many potential Americans in poor developing countries even though some want to move to opportunity much like our ancestors did.



Those are just some of the surface costs, not even considering the enormous decrease in freedom that would result from enforcing such an anti‐​immigrant policy shift. Those costs are not worth bearing just so some prudes won’t ever have to bear the sound of a language that don’t understand — assuming that no American gets a positive benefit from hearing other languages.



Immigration restrictions, deportations, and removals are the Pigouvian Tax solution to that “problem” and would cause far more damage than the bad feelings some Americans get from hearing another language spoken. Those who are upset by hearing a foreign language spoken should take solace in the fact that language assimilation proceeds very rapidly in the U.S., driven by the roughly 20 percent increase in wages that immigrants can expect from learning English.



Are there Coasean bargains that immigrants and natives could agree to so immigrants learn English faster? Perhaps. There are numerous charities and English as a Second Language classes available at a price of 0 that are, unsurprisingly, crowded. Private companies offer English classes with demand steadily expanding. The transaction costs of bringing together Americans who want to subsidize immigrants learning English are probably prohibitively high except in some special situation. Letting that negative externality continue is efficient.



The economic benefits of a global open borders immigration policy are estimated to be between 50 percent and 150 percent of global GDP — a tremendous gain. Comparing the economic costs and benefits of immigration produces such an unambiguously positive result that I’ll merely redirect the reader to other writings on the topic.



An externality of immigration that does impose costs on Americans is the welfare state. Although immigrants are infrequently legally allowed to use welfare and do so much less often than Americans, there is still some cost imposed on American taxpayers of having immigrants using welfare. The welfare costs of immigration are a government imposed externality that can be alleviated by denying immigrants access to welfare.



To be clear, the cost that immigrants impose on Americans through the welfare state is small, tiny in comparison to the economic benefit. Fortunately the cost of denying welfare to immigrants is far smaller than either of those, as I wrote here. Allowing Americans and immigrants to gain from immigration while decreasing the costs imposed upon American taxpayers via the welfare state would lead to a better outcome.



The transaction costs of a political deal to increase immigration and decrease access to welfare are high, as we’re seeing with the immigration reform debate, but far lower than not reforming immigration. Politically created externalities like welfare do not justify additional costly immigration restrictions — they justify their own removal.



Crime externalities exist — most visibly when unauthorized immigrants cross private property when entering the United States. Those costs are not decreased by doubling the number of border agents who will trample property or erecting border fences through eminent domain. Changing American immigration laws to allow legal entry will reduce property violations on the border. That’s far cheaper than “invading” the border and will likely be more successful at cutting down on that externality.



Some immigrants commit violent and property crimes that have severe externalities. There are more than 40 million immigrants in the U.S., it would be miraculous if none of them was a bad person. But while there have been some dramatic crimes committed by immigrants, they are less likely than U.S.-born Americans to commit crimes. The post‐​1990 boom in immigration has coincided with a secular decline in violent and property crime in the United States — especially in immigrant receiving cities like New York, Los Angeles, and other cities on the border. Immigration probably doesn’t cause a decrease in crime but immigrants certainly choose safe places to live and don’t make it worse — on average.



Curtailing legal immigration or declaring every unauthorized immigrant to be a criminal (many aren’t, they committed a civil offence), will not solve this problem. Focusing immigration enforcement on property and violent criminals while legalizing those who are neither will allow scarce government resources to focus on actual threats.



There are other externalities caused by immigration, but they are just as likely or more so to be positive than they are to be negative. One insight of the Coase theorem is that our institutions should have evolved to deal with these externalities in more efficient ways. Viewing the machinations of Congress and the President, it’s clear that our political institutions are likely making immigration reform of any kind more complicated, less beneficial, and less likely to occur.



So why haven’t many Coasean bargains been struck to decrease the negative externalities of immigration? Either the externalities are small and not worth bargaining over in a world of positive transaction costs or the transaction costs are prohibitively high. One thing is certain, the costs of complaining of immigration are low.



 **The Externalities of Exclusion**



What about the enormous harms imposed on Americans and immigrants by immigration restrictions? In order to justify severely restricting the ability of Americans to hire immigrants, sell them goods and services locally, rent them property, or otherwise interact with them in a peaceful and voluntary way, the government must point to a high probability and/​or high cost outcome in the absence of such restrictions. Except for the most hysterical people in online chat forums, few are arguing that such an event could occur let alone making a falsifiable prediction.



The harm on immigrants is tremendous. Nonsensical comparisons between the United States and corporations aside, immigrants are human beings with the same moral worth as the rest of us. To kill an immigrant without justification is murder just as much as killing an American without justification is murder. The same ethical and moral rules we apply toward our fellow Americans apply equally to immigrants. Restricting an immigrant’s ability to sell their labor and buy goods, services, and property from Americans hurts them quite a bit — more than it hurts Americans. We’d have to anticipate a very negative event to justify restricting immigration as much as our government currently does. Few such events are seriously anticipated and almost none are plausible even with outlandish assumptions.



Using immigration enforcement to weed out some immigrants who are likely to individually impose large costs on Americans is warranted. Excluding immigrants who have been convicted or serious property or violent crimes, are suspected terrorists (.1 percent of those in IAFIS), and could carry deadly communicable diseases into the U.S. are defensible actions that the government should undertake. But just because some immigrants will have those excludable characteristics does not mean other peaceful and healthy immigrants should be excluded.



America significantly curtailed European immigrant to the United States in 1921. From 1900–1913, Jewish emigration from anti‐​Semitic Russia annually averaged 19.7 per one thousand, meaning that 19.7 Jews per every thousand Russian Jews left every year. That intensity of immigration, 50 percent greater than for Ireland during the famine, was because of Pogroms and persecution by the Russian government. Luckily most of them were able to come to the United States.



As World War II and Communism loomed over Europe, the traditional refuge of America was closed to Jews and those threatened by the new regimes. In embarrassing and cruel episodes, American immigration authorities prevented Jews fleeing Nazi Germany from coming to America. That ultimate cost paid by the victims of the Holocaust and World War II who otherwise would have emigrated was an externality of American immigration laws at the time.



U.S. immigration policy at the time was responsible for the deaths of people who would have fled to America but were stopped due to our immigration laws. If someone is fleeing a burning building and you stop him, forcing him to turn back into that building and then it collapse, you are responsible for that person’s preventable death. That’s what U.S. immigration policy did to hundreds of thousands or even millions of potential immigrants to the U.S. post 1921. The negative externalities of our immigration policies should receive greater weight than the cultural prudishness or economic ignorance of immigration restrictionists.



One must consider this enormous cost imposed on Americans and immigrants — even if one discounts the harm done to immigrants — in order to justify continuing or increasing the restrictiveness of American immigration laws. The negative externalities of American immigration laws are gigantic.



 **Conclusion**



Our political institutions are not lowering transaction costs enough to facilitate efficient immigration reform. Cheap political biases and poor incentives do not facilitate a bargain between those who will gain from immigration and those who think they will lose. In most cases high transaction costs prevent harmful legislation from being passed but they also prevent harmful laws from being repealed. Coase’s insights help illuminate the potential bargains and costs of immigration.

"**Facebook says it has removed and banned hundreds of accounts to disrupt a ""violent, anti-government"" US network.**
It said the network was loosely linked to the broader far-right Boogaloo Bois movement but was distinct because it actively sought to commit violence.
Boogaloo Bois is a loose association advocating overthrow of the government and is committed to gun ownership.
The move comes as Facebook faces a boycott from advertisers over hate speech on the platform.
Major companies including Ford, Adidas, Coca-Cola and Starbucks have pulled advertising from Facebook, urged on by campaigners who say the social media firm doesn't do enough to remove racist and other hateful content.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it was disrupting the ""dangerous"" network on its platform.
""It is actively promoting violence against civilians, law enforcement and government officials and institutions,"" a statement said.
""Members of this network seek to recruit others within the broader Boogaloo movement, sharing the same content online and adopting the same offline appearance as others in the movement to do so.""
The Boogaloo Bois movement shares followers with some neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups, as well as libertarians and anarchists.
Facebook removed 220 accounts on its namesake platform and another 95 accounts from Instagram, as well as 28 pages and 106 groups that ""currently comprise the network"".
""We have also removed over 400 additional groups and over 100 other pages for violating our Dangerous Individuals and Organisations policy,"" it said.
It added that the removal of the accounts was ""the latest step in our commitment to ban people who proclaim a violent mission from using our platform"".
The social media site said it had been closely following the Boogaloo movement since 2019.
**By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Monitoring**
Although major Boogaloo Bois pages and groups with tens of thousands of members have vanished overnight, a few smaller ones are still up as Facebook says it will differentiate between the wider online community of Boogaloo supporters and those who identify as members of the Boogaloo Bois group.
A number of groups and pages anticipated the takedown a couple of weeks ago and removed any reference to the term Boogaloo from their names. The move seems to have worked for a few of them, but not all.
The administrators of a number of smaller pages that survived the cull have already told their followers to set up new pages and groups.
Overall, this is clearly a huge hit to those active in Boogaloo Bois groups. Relatively small on 4chan in its early days, it was the movement's presence on Facebook that helped it rapidly expand and attract thousands of new members.
TikTok and Discord have also moved to remove accounts linked to the group from their platforms in recent days.
Members of these groups may well now simply move the conversation to the hundreds of existing firearm-themed pages and groups on Facebook, or try to relocate to smaller, less mainstream platforms such as Parler and Telegram.
The Boogaloo Bois is loose and leaderless. Followers generally sign up to two fundamental beliefs - a desire for an armed overthrow of the government, and an unwavering commitment to gun ownership.
It began as a relatively small movement on 4chan, an imageboard website allowing anonymous posts on controversial topics which has been linked to the rise of the alt-right. However, over the years the Boogaloo Bois has grown considerably in size.
Last month, a US Air Force sergeant with links to the movement was charged with the murder of a federal security officer during a Black Lives Matter protest. He was also charged with the murder of another officer eight days later.
Armed members dressed in Hawaiian shirts and military fatigues have been seen attending Black Lives Matter rallies, claiming they were there to ""protect the protesters from police"". But analysts say they are increasingly capitalising on the protests to attack the authorities.
US Attorney General William Barr last week formed a Justice Department task force to counter violent anti-government extremists including the Boogaloo movement."
"**As the ads boycott grows, Mark Zuckerberg shows no sign of backing down.**
""My guess is that all these advertisers will be back on the platform soon enough"" the Facebook chief executive has said.
Campaigners accuse the tech firm of being too slow and reluctant to remove some hateful content.
But Zuckerberg added: ""We're not going to change our policies or approach on anything because of a threat to a small percent of our revenue.""
The comments were made to Facebook staff at a private meeting last Friday, and were subsequently leaked to the Information news site.
The social network has confirmed they are accurate and also announced a fresh development: its chief executive is to meet the organisers of the boycott - Stop Hate for Profit.
It illustrates the concurrent ways Facebook is dealing with the matter.
The first is to be publicly conciliatory: offer smaller changes and hit home its message that hate has no place on the platform.
The second is to privately play down the impact of the boycott: reassure advertisers and resist any fundamental changes to Facebook's business model.
Yesterday the firm's global affairs chief, Sir Nick Clegg, published an open letter to the ad world.
He attempted to assuage fears the company hadn't done enough to combat hate. Not surprisingly, he didn't echo his boss and add: ""You'll be back.""
Now, of course companies have different internal- and external-facing messages.
But this one in particular underlines the delicate tightrope that Facebook is trying to tread.
The company is undoubtedly rattled by this boycott. According to a list compiled by its organisers, more than 600 brands are now involved.
This week Facebook sent an email to companies and ad agencies assuring them it was doing all it could to remove hate speech.
""This work is never finished, and we're proud of how our apps can help people come together, learn, and organize against hate and show their solidarity"" an email to one ad agency said.
But the boycott isn't hurting Facebook as much as you might think.
In fact, Zuckerberg, in that same employee meeting, called the problem a ""reputational and a partner issue"" rather than a financial one.
And he has a point. The vast majority of large companies are still advertising with Facebook.
And thousands upon thousands of small-to-medium-sized businesses are doing likewise.
One advertising executive sent me an expletive-riddled text yesterday, dismissing the idea its clients would stop advertising on Facebook.
It's that kind of message that gives Zuckerberg reason to be bullish.
Areeq Chowdhury, from WebRoots Democracy, also believes the companies that have joined the boycott will come back.
""The advertising being offered by these internet giants is unparalleled."" he says.
""The level of targeting they can achieve is not matched anywhere else, so I find it hard to believe that a lot of them will stop advertising in the long run.""
That seems to be what the market thinks, too.
After a dip in Facebook's share price, it's back to pretty much where it was last week.
So, Facebook's strategy so far seems to be working.
The far greater worry is contagion - for example, if users started to leave Facebook and Instagram in large numbers in response to the boycott. But once again, there's little evidence of that happening.
On Wednesday, it was confirmed that Zuckerberg - along with Google's Sundar Pichai, Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos - would testify before Congress in an antitrust hearing later this month.
If the boycott continues to gather force, it could be an uncomfortable encounter, however secure Facebook may feel."

Share this...FacebookTwitterHe looks more like a guru, even a prophet. In Switzerland 73 year old Swiss Alps mountain guide Werner Munter is known as the “avalanche pope”. No one knows more about avalanches in the Alps and their risks than he does.

Werner Munter: Image credit: www.berge-im-kopf.ch.
Having authored some 20 books, he is credited for having revolutionized the science of avalanches.
The online Swiss swissinfo.ch here featured the expert and his position on the IPCC’s latest report late last year. Swissinfo.ch writes that although Munter is not a climate expert, he has read up on the subject extensively, and quotes Munter:
It’s unbelievable arrogance to believe that we would be able to sustainably influence the climate.”
He also tells Swissinfo.ch that he has found no evidence showing how CO2 could warm the climate. Swissinfo writes:
He views the current claims of most climate scientists as well as the experts of the UN (IPCC), who say mankind’s activities are causing climate change, as ‘piss take’.”
“Piss take” definition: here. Why is Munter skeptical? He cites hundreds of scientific papers opposing the current opinion of the IPCC and that there isn’t any consensus at all. Swissinfo.ch reports Munter does not dispute climate is changing, but believes man is not responsible for it.
Munter to Swissinfo.ch:
During the Holocene – a period on earth going back about 10,000 years – there were five phases when it was just as warm as it is today, or even warmer.”
Munter also tells Swissinfo.ch “CO2 is not a pollutant” and that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 stemming from man is “negligible”. He also doesn’t believe that CO2 is even a greenhouse gas, citing a paper by physicist Robert Wood.
On why the earth is warming, Munter says it all goes back to the sun. And by the sun he not only means solar irradiance but also the sun’s magnetic field, thus lending support to Svensmark’s theory.

Munter’s skepticism worryies media like Swissinfo.ch, and established climate scientists in Europe – for example Mike Schäfer, a risk communication professor at the University of Zurich. He tells Swissinfo.ch that Munter is not alone as a skeptic because “in the USA 20 to 30 percent of the population are climate skeptics” who do not believe man plays any real role on climate or the projected consequences.
Media do not share skeptic positions
Interestingly Swissinfo.ch writes that the number of skeptics in Germany and Switzerland is far smaller than in the USA. Schäfer attributes that to the fact that “practically no media share the positions of the climate skeptics.”
On skepticism in Switzerland, Swissinfo.com quotes Marko Kovic, president of an association for critical thinking: “Skeptiker Schweiz”, who claims skepticism in Switzerland is limited to only a few individuals:
These are people who as a rule who have read American website and blogs.”
Next Swissinfo.ch highlights how in Europe there is a strong popular consensus that man is responsible for climate change, and that this is not so in English speaking countries like the USA, Great Britain and Australia because the “vast majority of these persons have some kind of relation with the business lobbies of oil, coal or the automobile industry, who deny the impact of emissions on climate“.
Whew! The Swiss really are backwards and shallow in some ways. Little wonder Swiss women were not allowed to vote until 1971. It’s kind of like a “just shut up and get back to your place!” sort of culture.
Munter on the other hand also thinks there is corruption, telling Swissinfo.ch that climate science has been corrupted by money and politics. That does not go down very well. To refute Munter’s claim, Swissinfo.ch promptly contacted Urs Neu, Director of ProClim (a state-supported institute). Neu denies the accusation and cites an “evaluation of 12,000 scientific papers published between 1991 and 2011, which found that 97 percent of the authors suspect that human activity is the cause of climate change.”
Right. And before 1970, a survey by Swiss men showed 97% of half of Swiss men believed that women were too dumb to vote. Again it’s the caveman wooden club of authority thing.
Swissinfo.ch sums up by quoting state-funded warmist University of Genf professor Martin Beniston on the need for skeptics like Munter:
Skeptics allow scientists to tweek their arguments and to drive additional studies with which they can respond to their critics. If there had not been any opposition, then it would not have been possible to have made the great progress in climate science that we have seen.”
Right again. Swiss men also need a few independent-minded women to talk back from time to time – because this is what has allowed them to make great progress in being better-knowing husbands.
Hats off to Werner Munter for taking on such a conceited bunch.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNo matter what data one presents to hardline proponents of solar energy, they choose to bury their heads in the sand and hope it isn’t so. Today Spiegel presents data that are so striking that they could even jolt those caught deepest in fantasy back to reality.
Online Spiegel has an article today dubbed: Market Losers: These German Companies Destroyed The Most Capital. It lists the top capital destroyers of 2014. I had a feeling I’d find find maybe one or two solar companies, but it turns out that it’s actually far worse than I thought. Four of the top 12 are solar companies!
The number one German capital destroyer of 2014, Spiegel writes, was Solarworld. “The company lost almost 82 percent of its value. Since 2010 the share price has gone in the cellar, falling 99.5 percent, …”
Not only Solarwold made it on the list of the Top German Destroyers Of Capital, but so did 3 other solar technology companies. Brandenburg-based Aleo Solar took 6th place, losing 57 percent of its value in 2014.
The solar technology bloodbath was extended by 1999-founded Phoenix Solar, which lost 96% of its value last year, Spiegel writes. The company took 9th place.
Solar technology company SMA took 12th place on the list of the top German capital destroyers. No industry comes close to destroying the amount of capital that the solar industry wiped out last year. The big losers are from the solar industry, hands down.
The capital destruction that is Germany’s highly ballyhooed “Energiewende” (transition to renewable energy) does not end in the solar sector, but extends to the conventional power companies, who are reeling from the impacts of the subsidized renewable energies. Energy giants RWE and E.on come in at 35th and 43rd place respectively.
One senses that Germany’s entire energy industry is breaking up and falling to pieces.
It is truly mind-boggling how anyone can say solar energies are the future – unless you’re an insolvency administrator, that is.

 ** _Congress should_**



• encourage constitutional debate in the nation by engaging in constitutional debate in Congress and in public discussions, as in the nation’s earlier history;  
  
• enact nothing without first consulting the Constitution for proper authority and then debating that question on the floors of the House and the Senate;  
  
• move toward restoring constitutional government by carefully returning power wrongly taken over the years from the states and the people; and  
  
• reject judicial nominees who do not appreciate that the Constitution is a document of delegated, enumerated, and thus limited powers.



For much of America’s history, the Constitution was alive in the hearts and minds of the people and their leaders alike. They saw the document as defining them as a people animated by liberty; and they understood, albeit unevenly at times, that its basic function was to authorize and then limit the powers that were instituted through it. More often than not, therefore, measures aimed at expanding the federal government never made it out of Congress or, if they did, they were vetoed by presidents — not only on policy grounds but on constitutional grounds as well.



Today, however, in this chapter aimed at advising members of Congress about their authority and responsibilities under the Constitution, one hardly knows where to begin, so far has Congress taken us from constitutional government since the dawn of the 20th century. James Madison, the principal author of the Constitution, assured us in _Federalist_ No. 45 that the powers of the new government were “few and defined.” No one believes that describes Washington’s powers today. Instead, Congress and the president exercise vast powers that are nowhere authorized by the Constitution as originally understood. Individuals and businesses are regulated as never before. And so undisciplined by constitutional constraints is congressional spending that our national debt today is approaching $20 trillion and growing, and our unfunded liability is well over a staggering $100 trillion.



As history demonstrates, this cannot go on. If we do not begin to restore constitutional discipline and, indeed, constitutional legitimacy, America will go the way of other nations that have ignored the basic moral, political, legal, and economic principles our Constitution was written and ratified to secure.



For a while after the realigning midterm elections of 1994 it looked like Congress was at last going to rethink its seemingly inexorable push toward ever‐​larger government. In fact, the 104th Congress saw the creation in the House of a 100‐​strong Constitutional Caucus dedicated to promoting the restoration of limited constitutional government. And shortly thereafter President Bill Clinton announced that the era of big government was over. But the spirit of that Congress lasted only a short time before the usual spending and regulating returned.



With the midterm “tea party” elections of 2010, however, the constitutional winds blew again, more strongly, so much so that on the first full day of the 112th Congress, members of the House, for the first time in its history, took turns reading the Constitution aloud. But here too the voices of the voters who demanded a return to constitutional principles would soon be ignored, especially in the Senate. Yet the principles endure, as does the Constitution itself. It is still the law of the land, however little followed. And the implications of ignoring it have not changed either. Limited government is the foundation for liberty, prosperity, and the vision of equality that many Americans still cherish — to say nothing of millions around the world who are still inspired by the document.



To be sure, many members of Congress — and many Americans today as well — seem to believe that prosperity is brought about primarily by government programs, not by individuals acting in their private capacities in the private sector. And they believe, too, that the Constitution authorizes Congress to enact such programs. But there are many other Americans in this deeply divided country who know better. They understand that government rarely solves problems as promised; in fact, it usually makes them worse. More important still, they understand that a life dependent on government is both impoverishing and impoverished. They want no part of such dependence. They want a life of independence. They yearn to be free.



If we are to move toward restoring constitutionally limited government and the prosperity it encourages — toward a world in which government is no longer expected to solve our problems, but individuals, families, firms, and communities assume that responsibility, indeed, take up that challenge — the basic questions are how much to reduce and how fast to do it. Those are not questions about how to make government run better — waste, fraud, and abuse will ever afflict government — but about the fundamental role of government in America.



 _How Much to Reduce Government_



The first of those questions — how much to reduce government — would seem initially to be a matter simply of policy: What do we want government to do and what can we remove from government’s responsibility? Yet if we take the Constitution seriously, the Framers largely answered those questions. Indeed, they thought long and hard about the proper role of government. They drew on fundamental moral principles about individual liberty and set forth the broad policy outlines in the Constitution, expressly enumerating — and thus limiting — the powers of the federal government.



Thus, setting aside for the moment all practical concerns, the Constitution tells us as a matter of first principle how much to reduce government. It tells us, first, what powers the federal government in fact has and, second, how governments at all levels must exercise their powers — by respecting the rights of the people.



That means that if a federal power or program is not _authorized_ by the Constitution, it is illegitimate. Given the present size and scope of government, that is a stark conclusion, to be sure. But it flows quite naturally from the Tenth Amendment, the final statement in the Bill of Rights, which says, “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” In a nutshell, the Constitution establishes a government of delegated, enumerated, and thus limited powers. As the _Federalist Papers_ make clear, the Constitution was written not only to empower the federal government but to limit it as well.



Since the Progressive Era, however, the politics of government‐​as‐​problem‐​solver has dominated our public discourse. And since the New Deal constitutional revolution, following President Franklin Roosevelt’s infamous Court‐​packing threat, the Supreme Court has abetted that view by standing the Constitution on its head, turning it into a document of effectively unenumerated and hence unlimited powers.



Indeed, limits on government today, when we’ve had them, have come largely from political and budgetary rather than constitutional considerations. Thus, when government has failed to undertake a program in recent years, it has not been because of any perceived lack of constitutional authority but because of practical and political limits on the power of government to tax, borrow, and regulate. That is the mark of a parliamentary system, limited only by periodic elections, not of a limited, constitutional republic like we have.



The Founders could have established such a system, of course. They did not. But we have allowed those marks of a parliamentary system to supplant the system they gave us. To begin restoring truly limited government, therefore, we have to do more than define the issues as political or budgetary. We have to go to the heart of the matter and raise the underlying _constitutional_ questions. We have to ask the most fundamental question: Does the government have the _authority_ , the _constitutional_ authority, to do what it is doing?



 _How Fast to Reduce Government_



But as a practical matter, before Congress or the courts can relimit government as the Constitution requires, they need to take seriously the problems posed by both the present state of public opinion on the subject and, even more, individual dependence on public programs. After all, a substantial number of Americans — to say nothing of the institutions that influence public opinion — have little appreciation for or even apprehension of the constitutional limits on activist government.



Thus, in addressing the question of how fast to reduce government, we have to recognize that the Supreme Court, after nearly 80 years of arguing otherwise, is hardly in a position, by itself, to relimit government in the far‐​reaching way a properly read and applied Constitution requires. Nor does Congress, at this point, have sufficient moral authority or support to end tomorrow the vast array of programs it has enacted over the years — even if it wanted to. Worse still, millions of Americans have become dependent on those programs. For that reason alone, Congress will have to move slowly and carefully, balancing long‐​term goals with short‐​term necessities.



For either Congress or the Court to be able to do fully what should be done, therefore, a proper foundation must first be laid. At bottom, public opinion must evolve such that a sufficiently large portion of Americans support the changes needed. When enough people come forward to ask — indeed, to demand — that government limit itself to its constitutional powers, thereby freeing individuals, families, firms, and communities to solve their own problems, we will know we are on the right track. In that regard, one can only be encouraged by the handmade signs seen in the early, massive tea‐​party rallies in recent years that said, “We want less!” There is an untapped reservoir of support in America for less government and genuine independence.



Just how deep or wide that reservoir is remains to be seen, of course. Certainly, the debate today is different than it was in the 1960s and 1970s, when proposals for “national economic planning” could be introduced in Congress without embarrassment. And Americans have seen what happens in other countries when governments tax, spend, and regulate without restraint. Still, a good deal more must be done before Congress and the courts are able to move very far in the right direction. We are a long way from restoring constitutional government in America. To move the process along, Congress should take the lead in the following ways.



For much of America’s early history the Constitution played a prominent role in our political discourse. Members of Congress and presidents actively debated whether proposed measures were consistent with the Constitution. They did not, as often happens today, simply assume that they had the authority to introduce a given bill, pass it, and then leave it to the courts to determine its constitutionality. Nor did presidents make a practice of ruling by executive fiat and then arrogantly saying to those who took exception, “So sue me.” They took seriously their oaths to uphold the Constitution. That sense of moral and constitutional responsibility needs to be revived.



As noted above, it _was_ revived, briefly, by a number of House freshmen in the 104th Congress. Those representatives created an informal Constitutional Caucus to encourage constitutional debate in Congress and the nation and, in time, to begin restoring constitutional government. The caucus needs to be revived, along with the spirit behind it, and its work needs to be expanded.



By itself, of course, neither the caucus nor the entire Congress can solve the problems before us. To be sure, in principle, and in a reversal of all human experience, Congress in a day could agree to limit itself to its enumerated powers and then roll back the countless programs it has enacted by exceeding its constitutional authority. But authoritative opinions from the Supreme Court would be needed to reverse a substantial body of largely post–New Deal decisions and embed those restraints in “constitutional law” — even if they have been embedded in the _Constitution_ from the outset, the Court’s modern readings of the document notwithstanding.



 _The Goals of the Constitutional Caucus_



The _ultimate_ goal of the caucus and Congress, then, should be to encourage the Court to reach such decisions. Despite the distinction between politics and law, history teaches that the Court does not operate entirely in a vacuum. To some degree, public opinion is the precursor and seedbed of its decisions. Thus, the more immediate goal of the caucus should be to influence the debate in the nation by influencing the debate in Congress. To do that, it is not necessary or even desirable, in the present climate, that every member of Congress be a member of the caucus, however worthy that end might be. But it _is_ necessary that those who join the caucus be committed to its basic ends. And it is necessary that members establish a clear agenda for reaching those ends.



Here is the problem in a nutshell: every day, members of Congress are besieged by requests to enact countless measures to solve endless problems. Indeed, listening to much of the recent campaign debate, one might conclude that no problem is too personal or too trivial to warrant the attention of the _federal_ government no less. Yet most of the “problems” Congress spends most of its time addressing — from health care to day care, education, housing, economic competition, and so much more — are simply the personal and economic problems of life that individuals, families, and firms, not governments, should be addressing. What is more, as a basic point of constitutional doctrine, under a constitution like ours, interpreted as ours was meant to be interpreted, there is little authority for government at any level to address such problems.



Properly understood and used, then, the Constitution can be a valuable ally in the efforts of the caucus and Congress to reduce the size and scope of government. For in the minds and hearts of most Americans, it remains a revered document, however little it may be understood by a substantial number of them. Thus, a central purpose of congressional debate should be to bring about a better understanding of our basic legal document and to restore the idea in the minds of the people that the Constitution does not authorize the kind of government we have today. In particular, importuning constituents need to be told, “I have no authority to do what you want me to do.”



 _The Constitutional Vision_



If the Constitution is to be so used, however, the main misunderstanding that surrounds it today must be recognized and candidly addressed. That misunderstanding is that the Constitution, without further amendment, is an infinitely elastic document that allows government to grow to meet public demands of whatever kind. Americans must come to see that the Founders, who were keenly aware of the expansive tendencies of government, wrote the Constitution precisely to check that kind of thinking and that possibility. To be sure, they meant for government to be our servant, not our master. But they meant it to serve us in a very limited way — by securing our rights, as the Declaration of Independence says, and by doing those few other things that government does best, as spelled out expressly in the Constitution.



In all else, we were meant to be free — to plan and live our own lives, to solve our own problems. That is what freedom is all about. Some may characterize that vision as tantamount to saying, “You’re on your own.” But that kind of response simply misses the point. In America, individuals, families, and organizations have never been “on their own” in the most important sense. They have always been members of communities, of civil society, where they could live their lives and solve their problems by following a few simple rules about individual initiative and responsibility, respect for property and promise, and charity toward the few who need help from others. Massive government planning and programs have upset that natural order — less so in America than elsewhere, but deeply here all the same.



Those are the issues that need to be discussed, in both human and constitutional terms. As a people, we need to rethink our relationship to government. We need to ask not what our government can do for us, but what we can do for ourselves and, where necessary, for others — not through government but apart from government, as private citizens and organizations. That is what the Constitution was written to enable. It empowers government in a very limited way. It empowers people — by leaving us free — in every other way.



To proclaim and eventually secure that vision of a free people, the Constitutional Caucus should reconstitute itself and rededicate itself to that end at the beginning of the 115th Congress and the beginning of every Congress thereafter. The caucus should be both of and above Congress — as the constitutional conscience of Congress. Every member of Congress, before taking office, swears to support the Constitution. Today that’s hardly a constraining oath, given the modern Court’s open‐​ended reading of the document. Members of the caucus should dedicate themselves to the deeper meaning of that oath. They should support the Constitution the Framers gave us, as amended by subsequent generations, not as “amended” by the Court’s expansive interpretations.



 _Encouraging Debate_



Acting together, the members of the caucus could have a major impact on the course of public debate in this nation — not least by virtue of their numbers. What is more, there is political safety in those numbers. As Benjamin Franklin might have said, no single member of Congress can likely undertake the task of restoring constitutional government on his own; in the present climate, he would surely be hanged, politically, for doing so. But if the caucus hangs together, the task will be more bearable and enjoyable — and a propitious outcome more likely over time.



On the caucus agenda, then, should be those specific undertakings that will best stir debate and thereby move the climate of opinion. Drawn together by shared understandings, and unrestrained by the need for serious compromise, the members of the caucus are free to chart a principled course and employ principled means, which they should do.



They might begin, for example, by surveying opportunities for constitutional debate in Congress, then make plans to seize those opportunities. Clearly, when new bills are introduced, or old ones are up for reauthorization, an opportunity is presented to debate constitutional questions. But even before that, when plans are discussed in party sessions, members should raise constitutional issues. To get things going, the caucus might study the costs and benefits of eliminating clearly unconstitutional programs, the better to determine which can be eliminated most easily and quickly.



Above all, the caucus should look for strategic opportunities to employ constitutional arguments. Too often, members of Congress fail to appreciate that if they take a principled stand against a seemingly popular program — and state their case well — they can seize the moral high ground and ultimately prevail over those who are seen in the end to be more politically craven.



All of that will stir constitutional debate — which is just the point. For too long in Congress that debate has been dead, replaced by the often dreary budget debate. America was not established by men with green eyeshades. It was established by men who understood the basic character of government and the basic right to be free. Debate centered on the Constitution needs to be revived. It needs to be heard not simply in the courts — where it is twisted through modern “constitutional law” — but in Congress as well.



It would hardly seem necessary to ask Congress, before it enacts any measure, to cite its constitutional authority for doing so. After all, is that not part of what it means to carry out, as a member of Congress, one’s oath to support the Constitution? And if Congress’s powers are limited by virtue of being enumerated, then presumably there are many things Congress has no authority to do, however worthy those things might otherwise be. Yet so far have we strayed from constitutional thinking that such a requirement today is treated perfunctorily — when it is not ignored altogether.



The most common perfunctory citations — usually captured in constitutional boilerplate — are to the General Welfare, Commerce, and Necessary and Proper Clauses of the Constitution. It is no small irony that those clauses were written not only as grants of power but also as shields against overweening government; yet today they are simply swords of federal power.



 _The General Welfare Clause_



The first of Congress’s 18 enumerated powers in Article I, Section 8, is the power to tax (and, by implication, spend) “to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States.” In _Federalist_ No. 41 and elsewhere, Madison argued, as did Jefferson and others, that the General Welfare Clause was meant to serve as a brake on Congress’s power to tax and spend in furtherance of its _other_ enumerated powers or ends, all of which, he said, were subsumed under “the general welfare.” Taxing and spending pursuant to those ends had to serve the _general_ welfare, not the welfare of particular parties or sections of the country. Madison’s view contrasted sharply with that of Hamilton, who believed that Congress had an _independent_ power to tax and spend _for the general welfare_.



The problem with Hamilton’s view was stated clearly in 1828 by South Carolina’s William Drayton. Rising on the floor of the House, he said that it would undermine the very centerpiece of the Constitution, the doctrine of enumerated powers, rendering Congress’s 17 other powers superfluous. Since money can accomplish anything, he continued, whenever Congress wanted to do something it was barred from doing because given no power with which to do it, it could simply declare the act to be serving “the general welfare” and thus escape the limits imposed by enumeration. Indeed, he concluded, what was the point of enumerating Congress’s other powers if it could do whatever it wanted under this sole power?



Unfortunately, in 1936, in dicta and almost in passing, the Supreme Court revisited this early debate and came down, as a practical matter, on Hamilton’s side, declaring that there is an _independent_ power to tax and spend for the general welfare, albeit limited by the word “general.” Then, in 1937, in upholding the constitutionality of the new Social Security scheme, the Court completed the job when it stated the Hamiltonian view not as dicta but as doctrine. But while it reminded Congress of the constraint imposed by the word “general,” the Court added that it would not itself police that restraint but would leave it to Congress to police itself — the very Congress that was distributing money from the Treasury with ever greater particularity. Since that time, the relatively modest redistributive schemes that preceded the New Deal have grown exponentially until today they are everywhere.



In truth, textualists must grant that this was not the most artfully written part of our Constitution. Not surprisingly, Congress, to say nothing of the courts, often found the line it draws difficult to discern and apply even before the New Deal Congresses effectively ended fiscal discipline. Yet, a middle ground between Madison and Hamilton can be found if we focus on the power of Congress to tax and spend for the _general_ welfare _of the United States_ , as was done during most of the pre–New Deal era, albeit less as time went on. That interpretation would allow for spending on, among other things, limited infrastructure and certain “public goods” as economists define that idea, citing free‐​rider problems, nonexcludability, and nonrivalrous consumption.



But owing to the imprecision of this clause, it falls rather more to Congress than to the courts to exercise the discipline that is necessary to preserve the Constitution’s overall structure for limited government. Congress needs to rediscover that discipline. Indeed, this is quintessentially an area where _Congress_ needs to take the lead in debating the virtues of limited constitutional government as a _political_ matter rather than leaving it to the courts to find lines that are difficult to find as a _legal_ matter.



 _The Commerce Clause_



The Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which grants Congress the power to regulate “commerce among the states,” was also written primarily as a shield — in this case against overweening _state_ power. Under the Articles of Confederation, to protect local merchants and manufacturers from out‐​of‐​state competitors, states had erected tariffs and other protectionist measures that impeded the free flow of commerce among the states. In fact, the need to break the logjam that resulted was one of the principal reasons for the call for a convention in Philadelphia in 1787. To address the problem, the Framers gave Congress the power to regulate — or “make regular” — commerce among the states. It was meant primarily as a power to facilitate free trade. And it was so used in 1824 in the first great Commerce Clause case, _Gibbons v. Ogden_.



That functional account of Congress’s commerce power is consistent with the original understanding of the power, the text of the clause (especially the original meaning of “regulate”), and the structural limits entailed by the doctrine of enumerated powers. Yet today, following decisions by the Court in 1937, 1942, and beyond, Congress is able to regulate anything that even “affects” interstate commerce, which in principle is everything. Far from ensuring the free flow of commerce among the states, much of that regulation, for all manner of social and economic purposes, actually frustrates the free flow of commerce. In effect, the commerce power has become a general police power of a kind that the Framers reserved to the states.



 _The Necessary and Proper Clause_



Congress often exercises those redistributive and regulatory powers through the last of its 18 enumerated powers, its power “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.” Thus, the Necessary and Proper Clause affords Congress _instrumental_ powers: it provides Congress the _means_ for executing its other powers or pursuing its other enumerated ends. As such, therefore, it is not an independent power; rather, the means it affords Congress are limited by those other enumerated powers or ends — limited simply to carrying them into execution. Moreover, not any such instrumental powers will do: they must be both necessary for that purpose and proper — “proper” in respecting the other branches, the sovereignty of the states, and the rights of the people.



Just as the explosive growth of the modern redistributive state has taken place almost entirely under the General Welfare Clause, so has the growth of the modern regulatory state taken place almost entirely under the Commerce Clause — as complemented by the Necessary and Proper Clause in both cases. That raises the fundamental question that Drayton raised above, which members of Congress need to keep in mind: If the Framers had meant for Congress to be able to do virtually anything it wanted under just those three clauses, why did they bother to enumerate Congress’s other powers, or defend the doctrine of enumerated powers throughout the _Federalist Papers_? Those efforts would have been pointless.



Lopez _and Its Aftermath: A Case Study in Congressional Indifference_



Today, as noted above, congressional citations to the General Welfare, Commerce, and Necessary and Proper Clauses usually take the form of perfunctory boilerplate. When it wants to regulate some activity, for example, Congress makes a bow to the doctrine of enumerated powers by claiming that it has made findings that the activity at issue “affects” interstate commerce — say, by preventing interstate travel. Given those findings, Congress then claims it has authority to regulate the activity under its power to regulate commerce among the states.



Thus, when the 104th Congress was pressed in the summer of 1996 to do something about what looked at the time like a wave of church arsons in the South, it sought to broaden the already dubious authority of the federal government to prosecute such acts by determining that church arsons “hinder interstate commerce” and “impede individuals in moving interstate.” Never mind that the prosecution of arson has traditionally been a state responsibility, there being no general federal police power in the Constitution. Never mind that church arsons have virtually nothing to do with interstate commerce, much less with the free flow of goods and services among the states. The Commerce Clause rationale, set forth in boilerplate language, was thought by Congress to be sufficient to enable it to move forward and enact the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 — unanimously, no less.



Yet only a year earlier, in the celebrated _Lopez_ case, the Supreme Court had declared, for the first time in nearly 60 years, that Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause has limits. To be sure, the Court raised the bar against federal regulation only slightly: Congress would have to show that the activity it wanted to regulate “substantially” affected interstate commerce, leading Justice Clarence Thomas to note in his concurrence that the Court was still a good distance from a proper reading of the clause. Nevertheless, the decision was widely heralded as a shot across the bow of Congress. And many in that 104th Congress saw it as confirming at last their view that the body in which they served was simply out of control, constitutionally. Indeed, when it passed the Gun‐​Free School Zones Act of 1990 — the statute at issue in _Lopez_ — Congress had not even bothered to cite its authority under the Constitution, even in boilerplate. In what must surely be a stroke of consummate hubris — and disregard for the Constitution — Congress simply assumed that authority.



But as a mark of how quickly respect for constitutional principle evaporated even in that “radical” 104th Congress, despite the Court’s 1995 _Lopez_ ruling, Congress in 1996 passed the Gun‐​Free School Zones Act _again_! This time, however, the boilerplate was included in the form of a perfunctory “jurisdictional element,” even as Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee reminded his colleagues from the floor of the Senate that the Supreme Court had recently told them that they “cannot just have some theoretical basis, some attenuated basis” under the Commerce Clause for such a statute. The prosecution of gun possession near schools, like the prosecution of church arsons, is very popular, of course, as state prosecutors well know. But governments can address problems only if they have authority to do so, not from good intentions alone. Indeed, the road to constitutional destruction is paved with good intentions.



Congressional debate on these matters is thus imperative: it is not enough for Congress simply to say the magic words — “General Welfare Clause,” “Commerce Clause,” “Necessary and Proper Clause” — to be home free, constitutionally. Not every debate will yield satisfying results, as the examples above illustrate. But if the Constitution is to be kept alive, there must at least be debate. Over time, good ideas tend to prevail over bad ideas, but only if they are given voice. The constitutional debate must again be heard in the Congress of the United States as it was over much of our nation’s history, and it must be heard before bills are introduced, much less enacted. The American people can hardly be expected to take the Constitution and its limits on government seriously if their elected representatives do not.



If Congress should enact no new legislation without grounding its authority to do so securely in the Constitution, so too should it begin repealing legislation not so grounded, legislation that arose by assuming power that rightly rests with the states or the people. To appreciate how daunting a task that will be, simply reflect again on Madison’s observation that the powers of the federal government under the Constitution are “few and defined.”



But the magnitude of the task is only one dimension of its difficulty. Let us be candid: there are many in Congress who will oppose any efforts to restore constitutional government for any number of reasons, ranging from the practical to the theoretical. Some see their job as one primarily of representing the interests of their constituents, especially the short‐​term interests reflected in the phrase “bringing home the bacon.” Others simply like big government, whether because of an “enlightened” Progressive Era view of the world or because of a narrower, more cynical interest in the perquisites of enhanced power. Still others believe sincerely in a “living constitution,” one extreme form of which — the “democratic” form — imposes no limits whatever on government save for those arising from periodic elections. Finally, there are those who understand the unconstitutional and hence illegitimate character of much of what government does today but believe it is too late to do anything about it. All of those people and others will find reasons to resist the discrete measures that are necessary to begin restoring constitutional government. Where necessary, their views will have to be accommodated as the process unfolds.



 _Maintaining Support for Limited Government_



Given the magnitude of the problem, and the practical implications of repealing federal programs, a fair measure of caution is in order. As the nations of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union learned, it is relatively easy to get into socialism — just seize all property and labor and place it under state control — but much harder to get out of it. It is not simply a matter of returning what was taken, for much changed as a result of the taking. People have died and new people have come along. Public law has replaced private law. And new expectations and dependencies have arisen and become settled over time. The transition to freedom that many of those nations have experienced, to one degree or another, is what we and many other nations around the world today are facing, to a lesser extent, if we too try to reduce the size and scope of our governments.



As programs are reduced or eliminated, then, care must be taken to do as little harm as possible — for two reasons at least. First, there is a sense in which the federal government today, vastly overextended though it is, stands in a contractual relationship with the American people. That idea is very difficult to pin down, however, for once the real contract — the Constitution — has broken down, the “legislative contracts” that arise to take its place invariably come down to programs under which some people have become dependent upon others, although neither side had much say in the matter at the outset. Whatever its merits, that contractual view is held by a goodly portion of the public, especially regarding so‐​called middle‐​class entitlements.



That leads to the second reason why care must be taken in restoring power to the states and the people, namely, that the task must be undertaken, as noted earlier, with the support of a substantial portion of the people — ideally, at the urging of those people. Given the difficulty of convincing people — including legislators — to act against their relatively short‐​term interests, it will take sound congressional judgment about where and when to move. More important, it will take keen leadership, leadership that is able to frame the issues in a way that will communicate both the rightness and the soundness of the decisions that are required.



In exercising that leadership, there is no substitute for staying on message and keeping the message simple, direct, and clear. The aim, again, is both freedom and prosperity. We need to appreciate how the vast government programs we have created over the years have actually reduced the freedom and well‐​being of all of us — and have undermined the Constitution besides. Not that the ends served by those programs are unworthy — few government programs are undertaken for worthless ends. But individuals, families, private firms, and communities could bring about most of those ends voluntarily and at far less cost if only they were free to do so — especially if they were free to keep the wherewithal that is necessary to do so rather than give it to governmental redistributors. If individual freedom and individual responsibility are values we cherish — indeed, are the foundations of a good society — we must come to appreciate how our massive government programs have undermined those values and, with that, the good society itself.



 _Redistributive Programs_



Examples of the kinds of programs that should be returned to the states and the people are detailed elsewhere in this _Handbook_ , but a few warrant mention here. Without question, the most important example of devolution to come from the “radical” 104th Congress was in the area of welfare. However flawed the final legislation that President Clinton signed in 1996 may have been from both a constitutional and a policy perspective, it was still a step in the right direction. Ultimately, as discussed more generally below, welfare should not even be a state program. Rather, it should be a matter of private responsibility, as it long was in America. But the process of getting the government out of the business of charity — and the federal government especially, for the Constitution grants it no such authority — was at least begun in the 104th Congress.



Eventually, that process should be repeated in every other “entitlement” area, from individual to institutional to corporate, from Social Security and Medicare to the National Endowment for the Arts to the Department of Agriculture’s Market Access Program, and on and on. One assumes that each of those programs was started for a good reason, yet each involves taking from some and giving to others — policies that are both wrong and unconstitutional, to say nothing of monumentally inefficient. Taken together, they put us all on welfare in one way or another, and we are all the poorer for it.



Some of those programs will be harder to reduce, phase out, or eliminate than others, of course. Entitlement programs with large numbers of beneficiaries, for example, will require transition phases to minimize harm and maintain public support. Other programs, however, could be eliminated with relatively little harm. Does anyone seriously doubt that there would be art in America without the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)? Indeed, without the heavy hand of government grantmaking, the arts would likely flourish as they did long before the advent of the NEA — and critics would not be made to pay, through their taxes, for art they abhor.



In fact, it is the transfer programs in “symbolic” areas that may be the most important to eliminate first since they have multiplier effects reaching well beyond their raw numbers, and those effects are hardly neutral on the question of reducing the size and scope of government. As a matter of principle, does anyone seriously believe there is any constitutional authority whatever for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or the Department of Education? Yet each raises concerns about free speech — to say nothing of their potential for undermining the cause of limiting government. Not a few critics have pointed to the heavy hand of government in those symbolic areas. And of equal importance is the problem of compelled speech. As Jefferson wrote, “To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical.” But on a more practical note, if Congress is serious about addressing the climate of opinion in the nation, it will end such programs not simply because they rest on no constitutional authority but because they have demonstrated a relentless tendency toward propagating ever more government. Indeed, one can hardly expect those institutions to underwrite programs that advocate less government when they themselves exist through government.



 _Regulatory Redistribution_



If the redistributive programs that constitute the modern welfare state are candidates for elimination, so too are many of the regulatory programs that have arisen under the Commerce Clause. Here, however, care must be taken not simply from a practical perspective but from a constitutional perspective as well, for some of those programs may be constitutionally justified. When read functionally, recall, the Commerce Clause was meant to enable Congress to ensure that commerce among the states is regular, and especially to counter state actions that might upset that regularity. Think of the Commerce Clause as an early North American free trade agreement, without the heavy hand of “managed trade” that often accompanies the modern counterpart.



Thus conceived, the Commerce Clause clearly empowers Congress, through regulation, to override state measures that may frustrate the free flow of commerce among the states. But it also enables Congress to take such affirmative measures as may be necessary and proper to facilitate free trade, such as clarifying rights of trade in uncertain contexts or regulating the interstate transportation of dangerous goods. What the clause does not authorize, however, is regulation for reasons much beyond ensuring the free flow of commerce — the kind of managed trade, for example, that is little more than a thinly disguised transfer program designed to benefit one party at the expense of another, picking winners and losers.



Unfortunately, most modern federal regulation falls into that final category, whether it concerns employment or health care, insurance, banking, or whatever. In fact, given budgetary constraints on the ability of government to tax and spend — to take money from some, run it through the Treasury, and then give it to others — the preferred form of transfer today is through regulation. That puts it “off budget.” Thus, when an employer, an insurer, a lender, or a landlord is required by regulation to do something he would otherwise have a right not to do, or not do something he would otherwise have a right to do, he serves the party benefited by that regulation every bit as much as if he were taxed to do so, but no tax increase is ever registered on any public record. The temptation for Congress to resort to such “cost‐​free” regulatory redistribution is of course substantial, and the effects are both far reaching and perverse. Natural markets are upset as incentives are changed; economies of scale are skewed as large businesses, better able to absorb the regulatory burdens, are advantaged over small ones; defensive measures, inefficient from the broader perspective, are encouraged; and general uncertainty, anathema to efficient markets, is the order of the day. Far from facilitating free trade — the commerce power’s basic purpose — redistributive regulation frustrates it. Far from being justified by the Commerce Clause, it undermines the very purpose of the clause.



 _Federal Crimes_



In addition to misusing the commerce power for the purpose of regulatory redistribution, Congress has also misused it to create federal crimes. Thus, a great deal of regulation has arisen under the commerce power that is nothing but a disguised exercise of a general police power that Congress otherwise lacks. As noted earlier, the Gun‐​Free School Zones Act and the Church Arson Prevention Act are examples of legislation passed nominally under the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states; but the actions subject to federal prosecution under those statutes — gun possession and church arson, respectively — are properly regulated under a _state’s_ general police power, the power of states to “police” or secure our rights. There is no federal power to criminalize such acts, except as an implication of federal sovereignty over federal territory or as may be necessary and proper for carrying into execution Congress’s enumerated powers or ends.



The ruse of using the commerce power to criminalize acts that are the proper jurisdiction of the states should be candidly recognized. Indeed, it is a mark of the decline of respect for the Constitution’s limits on federal power that when we fought a war on liquor early in the last century, we felt it necessary to do so by first amending the Constitution, there being no power otherwise for such a federal undertaking; but today, when we fight a war on drugs — with as much success as we enjoyed in the earlier war — we do so without so much as a nod to the Constitution.



The Constitution lists three federal crimes: treason, piracy, and counterfeiting. Today there are more than 3,000 federal crimes and perhaps 300,000 regulations that carry criminal sanctions. Over the years, no faction in Congress has been immune, especially in an election year, from the propensity to criminalize all manner of activities, utterly oblivious to the lack of constitutional authority for doing so. We should hardly imagine that the Founders fought a war to free us from a distant tyranny only to establish a tyranny in Washington, in some ways even more distant from the citizens it was meant to serve.



 _Policing the States_



The federal government has not only intruded on the police power of the states, it has also failed in its responsibility under the Fourteenth Amendment to police the states. Here is an area where federal regulation has been, if anything, too restrained — yet, when undertaken, often unprincipled as well.



The Civil War Amendments changed America’s federalism fundamentally and very much for the better, giving citizens an additional level of protection, not against federal but against state oppression — the oppression of slavery, obviously, but much else besides. Thus, the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, begins by defining both federal and state citizenship, making it clear that the recently freed slaves were citizens of both the United States and the states wherein they resided. It then provides that “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Those provisions of Section 1 are self‐​executing, which means that individuals can go straight into court to enforce them. And Section 5 gives Congress the “power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.”



Unfortunately, confusion surrounded the interpretation and enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment almost from the start. As the debate over the adoption of the amendment makes clear, the Privileges or Immunities Clause was meant to be the principal source of substantive rights under it, and those rights were meant to include the rights of free people everywhere: property, contract, personal security — in short, our “natural liberties,” as Blackstone had earlier understood “privileges or immunities” to mean. But in 1873, in the notorious _Slaughterhouse Cases,_ a bitterly divided Supreme Court essentially eviscerated the Privileges or Immunities Clause. There followed, for nearly a century, the era of Jim Crow in the South and, for a period stretching to the present, a Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence as contentious as it is confused.



Increasingly over the 20th century, especially in the second half, modern liberals urged that the amendment be used as it was meant to be used — against state oppression; but their uses were selective, often reflecting a political agenda. On one hand, they urged courts to recognize “rights” that are no part of the natural rights that inform the amendment; on the other hand, they ignored or denigrated rights that were meant to be protected, like property and contract rights. For their part, modern conservatives, partly in reaction, called for the amendment to be used far more narrowly than it was meant to be used — for fear that it might be misused, as it has been. To sort this confusion out, there is no better place to begin than with the text of the abandoned Privileges or Immunities Clause. (Judicial methodology will be discussed more fully below.)



Again, the clause says that no state shall abridge “the privileges or immunities _of citizens of the United States_.” We need to know, then, what the privileges or immunities of U.S. citizens were. And for that, we turn to the prior text of the Constitution. So doing, we find the few rights mentioned in the original Constitution; the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, at least as those can be applied by the Privileges or Immunities Clause against the states; and the many unenumerated rights we “retained” pursuant to the doctrine of enumerated powers as recognized by the Ninth Amendment, as discussed earlier. When the Bill of Rights was ratified, those privileges or immunities, except as otherwise provided, were not held against the _states_ because, in 1833, in _Barron v. Baltimore_ , the Supreme Court held that the Bill of Rights applied only against the government that was created by the document to which it was appended, the Constitution. That changed, however, and changed radically once the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. No longer could _states_ abridge those constitutional rights.



That reading is perfectly consistent with the debates that surrounded not only the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment but the prior enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which the amendment was meant to constitutionalize and which Congress reenacted in 1868, just after the amendment was ratified. All citizens, the Civil Rights Act said in part, “have the right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties and give evidence; to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property.” Such were some of the “privileges or immunities” the Fourteenth Amendment was meant to secure.



Clearly, those basic natural and common law rights, drawn from the classic Lockean, reason‐​based theory of rights, were meant to be protected first by ordinary _state_ law. But just as clearly, states often violated them, either directly or by failing to secure them against private violations, which is why the Fourteenth Amendment was needed. And states continued to violate them even after the amendment was ratified. Now, however, invoking one’s _constitutional_ rights against one’s own state, appeal could be made to the courts, under Section 1 of the amendment, or to Congress, under Section 5, as noted above.



But once the Supreme Court eviscerated the Privileges or Immunities Clause, Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence took a wandering turn. With the clause no longer available, courts began deciding cases under the less substantive Due Process or Equal Protection Clauses. That led in time to opposing complaints: on one hand were charges, made mainly by modern conservatives, that a rudderless “substantive due process” encouraged judges to invent “rights” and thus override democratic majorities; on the other hand were charges, made mainly by modern liberals, that a narrow “procedural due process” encouraged judges to defer to democratic majorities that were overriding individual rights. As the debate played out over the second half of the 20th century, it became increasingly clear that the heart of the problem was the demise of the Privileges or Immunities Clause and, with it, the theory of rights that stood behind the clause. Yet neither side seemed willing to revive the clause, much less do the serious work of discovering its true content.



That stalemate gave rise to a group of _classical_ liberals and libertarians and to a call for returning to first principles, not only those of our founding but those of our second founding as well, when the principles of the Declaration of Independence, including equal treatment, were incorporated at last into the Constitution. Classical liberals urged reviving not only the doctrine of enumerated powers and the original understanding of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments but also the Privileges or Immunities Clause. Responding to objections from conservatives, we made it clear that that would give the courts and Congress no power to secure modern “entitlements,” which are no part of the common law tradition of life, liberty, and property. Rather, the power to secure rights that would be revived would be limited by the rights to be secured. To be sure, that power reaches _intrastate_ matters when states are violating the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment. But that is exactly what the amendment was meant to do. And that is the fundamental issue that the _Slaughterhous_ e majority failed to recognize.



Thus, if the facts had warranted it, something like the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996, depending on its particulars, might have been authorized not on Commerce Clause but on Fourteenth Amendment grounds. If, for example, the facts had shown that arsons of white churches were being prosecuted by state officials whereas arsons of black churches were not, then we would have had a classic case involving the denial of the equal protection of the laws. With those findings, Congress would have had ample authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment “to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.”



Unfortunately, in the final version of the act, Congress struck citations to the Fourteenth Amendment, choosing instead to rest its authority entirely on the Commerce Clause. Not only is that a misuse of the Commerce Clause, inviting further misuses in the future, but assuming the facts had warranted it, it is a failure to use the Fourteenth Amendment as it was meant to be used, inviting future failures. Again, the Fourteenth Amendment has been both underused and misused by both Congress and the courts. But that is no reason to ignore it. Rather, it is a reason to correct the errors and use it properly.



In its efforts to return power to the states and the people, then, Congress must be careful not to misunderstand its role in our federal system. Over the 20th century, Congress assumed vast powers that were never its to assume, powers that belong properly to the states and the people. Those need to be returned. But at the same time, Congress and the courts do have authority under the Fourteenth Amendment to ensure that citizens are free from _state_ oppression — free from “grassroots tyranny.” However much that authority may have been underused or overused, it is there to be used; and if it is properly used, objections by states about federal interference in their “internal affairs” are without merit.



There is a crucial difference between the Constitution and “constitutional law” — the body of Supreme Court decisions that have interpreted and applied the Constitution, correctly or not, as cases have come before the Court over the years. As noted earlier, Congress could restore constitutional government on its own initiative simply by restricting its actions in the future to those that are authorized by the Constitution and by repealing its past actions that were taken without such authority. But for those limits to become “constitutional law” they would have to be recognized as such by the Supreme Court, which essentially abandoned that view of limited government during the New Deal. Thus, for the Court to play its part in the job of restoring constitutional government — or returning to rule under the Constitution — it must recognize the mistakes it has made, especially following Roosevelt’s Court‐​packing threat in 1937, and then rediscover “the Constitution” — a process it began, however tentatively, in its 1995 _Lopez_ decision when Chief Justice William Rehnquist rested his opinion explicitly on “first principles.”



Unfortunately, in its 2005 California medical marijuana decision, _Gonzales v. Raich_ , the Court abandoned the principles it had articulated in _Lopez_ (and had articulated more fully in its 2000 _Morrison_ decision). But in its 2011 _NFIB v. Sibelius_ decision, challenging Obamacare’s individual mandate and Medicaid expansion, the Court returned to principle, at least insofar as it held that there are limits on Congress’s commerce and spending powers. What those and several other related decisions portend for the future of constitutional restoration by the Court is thus uncertain. At the least, after nearly eight decades of effectively unlimited government, we can say that the idea of a government of constitutionally limited powers is back in play.



But apart from its own actions, Congress is not powerless to influence the Court in the direction of constitutional restoration. As vacancies arise on the Court and on lower courts, Congress has a substantial say about who sits there through its power of advise and consent. To exercise that power well, however, it must have a better grasp of the basic issues than it has shown in recent years during Senate confirmation hearings for nominees for the courts. In particular, the Senate’s obsession with “judicial activism” and “judicial restraint,” terms that in themselves are largely vacuous, only distracts it from the real issue: the nominee’s philosophy of government and conception of the Constitution. To appreciate those points more fully, a bit of background is in order.



 _From Powers to Rights_



The most important matter to grasp is the fundamental change that took place in our constitutional jurisprudence during the New Deal and the implications of that change for the modern debate. For decades after the New Deal constitutional revolution, debate focused far more on rights than on powers, and not surprisingly since the 1937 Court effectively eviscerated the doctrine of enumerated powers. Thus, in Supreme Court confirmation hearings, Senators have sought primarily to learn about a nominee’s views about what rights are “in” the Constitution. That is an important question, to be sure, but it must be addressed within a larger constitutional framework, and that is what has been missing too often from recent hearings.



Clearly, the American debate began with rights — with the protests that led eventually to the Declaration of Independence. In that seminal document, Jefferson made rights the centerpiece of the American vision: rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, derived from a premise of moral equality, itself grounded in a higher or natural law discoverable by reason — all to be secured by a government of limited powers made legitimate through consent.



But when they met again 11 years later to draft a constitution, the Framers focused on _powers_ , not rights, and for two main reasons. First, their initial task was to create and empower a stronger government than had been authorized by the Articles of Confederation, which the Constitution did once it was ratified. But their second task, of equal importance, was to limit that government. And for that, they had two main options. They could have listed a set of _rights_ that the new government would be forbidden to violate. Or they could have limited the government’s _powers_ by enumerating them, then pitting one power against another through a system of checks and balances — the idea being that where there is no power there is, by implication, a right, belonging to the states or the people. They chose the second option, for they could hardly have enumerated all of our rights, but they _could_ enumerate the new government’s powers, which were meant from the outset to be, as Madison said, “few and defined.” Thus, _the doctrine of enumerated powers_ became our principal defense against overweening government.



Only later, during the course of ratification, did it become necessary to add a Bill of Rights — as a _secondary_ defense. But in so doing, the Framers were still faced with a pair of objections that had been posed from the start. First, it was impossible to enumerate all of our rights, which in principle are infinite in number. Second, given that problem, the enumeration of only certain rights would be construed, by ordinary methods of legal construction, as denying the existence of others. To overcome those objections, therefore, the Framers wrote the Ninth Amendment: “The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” Clearly, we cannot “retain” what we do not first have to be retained — the natural rights we were born with and did not give up when we authorized and instituted the government through ratification.



 _Constitutional Visions_



Thus, with the Ninth Amendment making it clear that we have both enumerated and unenumerated rights, the Tenth Amendment making it clear that the federal government has only enumerated powers, and the Fourteenth Amendment later making our rights good against the states as well, what emerges is an altogether libertarian picture. Individuals, families, firms, and the infinite variety of institutions that constitute civil society are free to pursue happiness as they wish, in accord with whatever values they have, provided only that in the process they respect the equal rights of others to do the same; and governments are instituted to secure that liberty and do the few other things their constitutions make clear they are _authorized_ and empowered by the people, through their constitutions, to do.



That picture is a far cry from the modern liberal’s vision, rooted in the Progressive Era, which would empower government to manage all manner of economic affairs. But it is a far cry as well from the modern conservative’s vision, which would empower government to manage a substantial range of personal affairs. Neither vision reflects the true constitutional scheme. Both camps want to use the Constitution to promote their own substantive agendas. Repeatedly, liberals invoke democratic power for ends that are nowhere authorized by our Constitution of limited powers; at other times they invoke “rights,” especially redistributive “rights,” that are no part of our unenumerated rights, requiring government programs that are nowhere authorized, while ignoring rights like property and freedom of contract that are plainly enumerated. But conservatives too rely largely on expansive readings of democratic power that were never envisioned, thereby running roughshod over rights that were meant to be protected, especially unenumerated rights.



 _From Liberty to Democracy_



The great change in constitutional vision took place during the New Deal when the idea that galvanized the Progressive Era — that the basic purpose of government is to solve what are mainly personal problems — was finally instituted in law, not with an opinion here and there as had already been happening, but systematically through several Supreme Court decisions that, taken together, amounted to a radical reinterpretation of the Constitution, standing it on its head.



As noted earlier, following President Roosevelt’s 1937 Court‐​packing threat, the Court eviscerated our first line of defense, the doctrine of enumerated powers, with a pair of decisions that converted the shields contained in the General Welfare and Commerce Clauses into swords of power. Then, in 1938, a cowed Court undermined the second line of defense, our enumerated and unenumerated rights, when it declared that henceforth it would defer to the political branches and the states when their actions implicated “nonfundamental” rights like those associated with “ordinary commercial transactions” — property and contract rights, for example. Legislation implicating such rights would be given minimal scrutiny, the Court said in effect, which in practice amounted essentially to no scrutiny at all. By contrast, when legislation implicated “fundamental” rights like voting, speech, and, later, certain “personal” liberties, the Court would apply “strict scrutiny,” rendering most such acts unconstitutional. Finally, in 1943, the Court jettisoned the nondelegation doctrine, grounded in the first word of the Constitution after the Preamble: “ _All_ legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress.” That allowed Congress to delegate ever more of its legislative powers to the executive branch agencies it had been creating, which is where most of our law today is written in the form of regulations, rules, interpretations, and more, thus undermining a core constitutional principle, the separation of powers.



Through those decisions, the Constitution was transformed, without benefit of amendment, from a limited libertarian to an expansive majoritarian document. The floodgates were thus opened to majoritarian tyranny, which very quickly became special‐​interest tyranny, including “crony capitalism,” as public choice economic theory demonstrates should be expected. And that led in turn to claims from many quarters that rights were being violated by these programs. Thus, the Court, focusing now not on powers but on rights, would have to try to determine whether the rights being claimed were or were not “in” the Constitution — a question the Constitution had spoken to only indirectly, for the most part, through the now‐​discredited doctrine of enumerated powers. And if it found the rights in question, the Court would then have to determine whether they were “fundamental” rights, to be protected under “strict scrutiny,” or only “nonfundamental” rights, which would be ignored if there were some “rational basis” — some _conceivable_ reason — for the legislation that implicated them. Where in the Constitution is this judicial methodology to be found? Nowhere. The Court invented it from whole cloth to make the world safe for the New Deal’s social engineering schemes.



 _Judicial “Activism” and “Restraint”_



Thus, it is no accident that until very recently the modern debate focused on rights, not powers. With the doctrine of enumerated powers effectively dead and government’s powers essentially unlimited, the main issue left for the Court to decide, apart from structural and related issues, was whether there might be any rights that would restrain that power and whether those rights are or are not “fundamental.” In the post–New Deal era, both liberals and conservatives bought into this jurisprudence. As noted above, both camps believed that the Constitution gives a wide berth to democratic decisionmaking. Neither side any longer asked the first question, the fundamental _constitutional_ question: Does Congress have _authority_ to pursue this end? Instead, that authority was simply taken for granted. Congress takes a policy vote on whatever proposal is before it and leaves it to the courts to determine whether there are any “fundamental” rights that might restrict their power.



Modern liberals, addicted to government programs, urged the Court to be “restrained” in finding rights that might limit their redistributive and regulatory schemes, especially “second‐​class” rights like property and contract. At the same time, they asked the Court to be “active” in finding “rights” invented from whole cloth that served their political agenda.



But modern conservatives were often little better. Reacting to abuses by liberal judicial “activists,” most conservatives called for judicial “restraint” across the board. Thus, if liberal programs ran roughshod over the rights of individuals to use their property or freely contract, the remedy, conservatives often said, was not for the Court to invoke the doctrine of enumerated powers — that battle was lost during the New Deal — nor even to invoke the rights of property and contract that are plainly in the Constitution — that might encourage judicial activism — but to turn to the democratic process to overturn those programs. Oblivious to the fact that restraint in finding rights is tantamount to activism in finding powers, and ignoring the fact that it was the democratic process that gave us those programs in the first place, too many conservatives offered us a counsel of despair amounting to a denial of constitutional protection.



No one doubts that in recent decades the Court has discovered “rights” in the Constitution that are no part of either the enumerated or unenumerated rights that the document was meant to protect. But it is no answer to that problem to ask the Court to defer wholesale to the political branches, thereby encouraging it, by implication, to sanction unenumerated _powers_ that are no part of the document either. Indeed, if the Tenth Amendment means anything, it means that there are no such powers. Again, if the Framers had wanted to establish a simple democracy, they could have. Instead, they established a limited, constitutional republic, a republic with islands of democratic power in a sea of liberty, not a sea of democratic power surrounding islands of liberty.



Thus, it is not the proper role of the Court to find rights that are no part of the enumerated or unenumerated rights meant to be protected by the Constitution, thereby frustrating authorized democratic decisions. But neither is it the proper role of the Court to refrain from determining if those democratic decisions are in fact authorized and, if they are, whether their implementation violates rights guaranteed by the Constitution, enumerated and unenumerated alike.



The role of the judge in our constitutional republic is thus profoundly important and often profoundly complex. “Activism” is no proper posture for a judge, but neither is “restraint.” Judges must apply the Constitution to cases or controversies before them, neither making it up nor ignoring it. They must be actively _engaged_ with the document and, especially, with its underlying principles. In particular, they must appreciate keenly that the Constitution is a document of delegated, enumerated, and thus limited powers. That will get the judge started on the question of what rights are protected by the document; for again, where there is no power, there is a right, belonging either to the states or to the people. Indeed, we should hardly imagine that, before the addition of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution failed to protect most rights simply because most were not “in” the document. But reviving the doctrine of enumerated powers is only part of the task before the Court. Especially when assessing the character and scope of state police power — the basic power of government to secure our rights — judges and justices must have a deep understanding of the classical theory of rights that stands behind the Constitution if it is to be restored correctly.



Those are the two sides — powers and rights — that need to be examined in the course of Senate confirmation hearings for nominees for the courts of the United States. It is important to know a nominee’s “judicial philosophy,” to be sure. But it is more important still to know his or her philosophy of the Constitution, for in the end it is the Constitution that defines us as a nation.



If a nominee does not have a deep and thorough appreciation for the basic principles of the Constitution — for the doctrine of enumerated powers and for the classical theory of rights that underpins the Constitution — then his or her candidacy should be rejected. In recent years, Senate confirmation hearings have provided opportunities for constitutional debate throughout the nation. Those debates need to move from the ethereal and often arid realm of “constitutional law” to the real realm of the Constitution. They are extraordinary opportunities not simply for constitutional debate but for constitutional renewal.



Unfortunately, in recent Congresses, we have seen the debate move not from “constitutional law” to the Constitution but in the opposite direction — to raw politics. We have heard demands that judicial nominees pass “ideological litmus tests,” for example, as if judges in their work were supposed to reflect popular views of one sort or another. That is tantamount to asking judges not to _apply_ the law, which is what judging is all about, but to _make_ the law according to those values, whatever the actual law may require, and to commit to doing so during the judicial confirmation process no less. The duty of a judge under the Constitution is to decide cases according to the law, not according to whatever values or ideology may be in fashion. For that, the only ideology that matters is that of the Constitution.



America is a democracy only in the most fundamental sense of that idea: authority, or legitimate power, rests ultimately with the people, as manifested through the Constitution. Having authorized that power, the people have no more right thereafter to tyrannize each other through majoritarian acts than government itself has to tyrannize the people. When they constituted us as a nation by ratifying the Constitution and the amendments that have followed, our ancestors gave up only certain of their powers as enumerated in the document, leaving us otherwise free to live our lives as we wish. We have allowed those powers to expand beyond all moral and legal bounds — at the price of our liberty and our well‐​being. The time has come to start returning those powers to their proper bounds, to reclaim our liberty, and to enjoy the fruits that follow.

"**Facebook has pushed back against a European Union investigation into its practices, taking it to court over privacy concerns.**
Two investigations are being carried out into Facebook to find out if it breaches competition laws.
To gather information, the European Commission has demanded internal documents from Facebook that include 2,500 specific key phrases.
Facebook says that means handing over unrelated but highly sensitive data.
The European Commission says it will defend the case in court, and its investigation into Facebook's potential anticompetitive conduct is ongoing.
The social media giant has filed an appeal to the EU courts, arguing against the breadth of the document requests.
""We are cooperating with the commission and would expect to give them hundreds of thousands of documents,"" said Tim Lamb, Facebook's competition lawyer.
""The exceptionally broad nature of the commission's requests means we would be required to turn over predominantly irrelevant documents that have nothing to do with the commission's investigations, including highly sensitive personal information such as employees' medical information, personal financial documents, and private information about family members of employees.""
A Facebook spokesperson stressed the company is not trying to hold up the investigation, saying the firm has been very forthcoming with information so far.
He said Brussels' request for any documents which include the phrases ""big question"", ""shut down"" and ""not good for us"" could even force Facebook to hand over confidential security assessments of its California headquarters.
Facebook says it offered commission investigators the chance to view sensitive but unrelated documents in a secure-viewing room where no copies could be made, but the offer was refused."
"**Coca-Cola will suspend advertising on social media globally for at least 30 days, as pressure builds on platforms to crack down on hate speech.**
""There is no place for racism in the world and there is no place for racism on social media,"" the drinks maker's chairman and CEO James Quincey said.
He demanded ""greater accountability and transparency"" from social media firms.
It came after Facebook said it would label potentially harmful or misleading posts left up for their news value.
Founder Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would also ban advertising containing claims ""that people of a specific race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity or immigration status"" are a threat to others.
The organisers of the #StopHateforProfit campaign, which accuses Facebook of not doing enough to stop hate speech and disinformation, said the ""small number of small changes"" would not ""make a dent in the problem"".
More than 90 companies have paused advertising in support of #StopHateforProfit.
As a result of the boycott, shares in Facebook fell 8.3% on Friday, eliminating $56bn (Â£45bn) from the company's market value and knocking $7.2bn off Mr Zuckerberg's personal net worth, Bloomberg reported. As a result of the loss, Louis Vuitton boss Bernard Arnault replaced the Facebook founder as the world's third richest individual.
Coca-Cola told CNBC its advertising suspension did not mean it was joining the campaign, despite being listed as a ""participating business"".
Mr Quincey said the company would use the global ""social media platform pause"" to ""reassess our advertising policies to determine whether revisions are needed"".
Clothes maker Levi Strauss & Co also said it would be pausing advertising on Facebook following Mr Zuckerberg's announcement. Unlike Coca-Cola, it accused the social media firm of not going far enough.
""We are asking Facebook to commit to decisive change,"" CMO Jen Say said.
""We want to see meaningful progress towards ending the amplification of misinformation and hate speech and better addressing of political advertisements and content that contributes to voter suppression. While we appreciate that Facebook announced some steps in this direction today - it's simply not enough.""
The #StopHateforProfit coalition - which includes the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) - said none of the changes would be vetted or verified.
""We have been down this road before with Facebook. They have made apologies in the past. They have taken meagre steps after each catastrophe where their platform played a part. But this has to end now,"" it added.
The campaign called on Mr Zuckerberg to take further steps, including establishing permanent civil rights infrastructure within his company; submitting to independent audits of identity-based hate and misinformation; finding and removing public and private groups publishing such content; and creating expert teams to review complaints."
"One of the biggest contemporary challenges for humanity is to safeguard food security for current and future generations. A growing demand and a steady increase of the world population – nearly 10 billion people are expected to inhabit Earth by 2050 – requires that food production per area of cultivated land will have to increase drastically. Expanding into land that is currently uncultivated is not feasible, especially considering the pressures of climate change. One way to achieve higher yields will be reducing crop losses caused by pests, including insects. For instance, in cereal crops such as rice and maize, which are staple foods for a large part of the world’s population, insects result in up to 15% losses.  Spraying chemical insecticides remains the main approach to combating insect attacks in many crops. But their future use is under scrutiny because of many concerns, not least their effects on human health. Their use also represents a large economic burden on growers, especially those in developing countries. And in any case, it is feared that insects will soon develop resistance to insecticides. Curtailing their use would also be good for the planet, as insecticides are inherently unsustainable: their continuous use has resulted in massive environment pollution, which negatively affect other beneficial organisms such as bees, birds, fishes and livestock. This means that there is increasing consumer demand for residue-free food. Linked to this, the availability of insecticides for insect management is declining globally due to considerable changes in their legislation.  So there is an urgent need to find alternatives – preferably environmentally friendly strategies for protecting crops against insects. Biological control, in which insect populations are reduced by using other insects (their natural enemies) is generally accepted as a sustainable and ecologically sound approach to reduce crop losses by insects. These natural enemies are often highly specialised and only attack a certain number of closely related insect pests, reducing the likelihood of unforeseen knock-on effects on the rest of the local ecosystem that are commonly caused by insecticides. Natural enemies can also be introduced to control new invading insect pests. For example, European natural enemies were introduced in North America to control a new infestation of bark beetles, which carry and spread Dutch elm disease. Natural enemies of insect pests include predators, pathogens (micro-organisms that include bacteria, fungi, and viruses), and parasitoids (mostly wasps or flies which lay their eggs on or in other insect, eventually killing them as the larvae grow). Parasitoids are the most effective of these three types because their numbers increase much faster than those of the predators. In addition, they are highly specialised, as they are only able to lay their eggs in a specific species and therefore have minimal effects on the rest of the ecosystem. Parasitoids are very diverse and constitute of a staggering number of insect species (nearly 14% of all described insects). Many species are currently mass-reared in commercial insectaries to be released in big numbers to obtain immediate control of the pests attacking orchards or greenhouses. But their effectiveness needs to be improved. This not only demands increasing their numbers in the fields, but also enhancing their foraging success. While foraging for food or hosts, parasitoids generally depend on visual and olfactory cues. For example, they often locate resources from particular flowers by responding to the scent and colour of flowers. They possess the ability to learn associations between these cues and rewards such as food or host, cleverly using this learned information the next time. This allows them to find their resources faster and therefore increase their foraging success. Parasitoids forage for carbohydrate-rich food such as floral nectar. Floral nectar is an ideal habitat for diverse microbes such as yeasts, which not only alter its composition of sugars and amino acids, but also produce special scents. These scents produced by nectar yeast are very attractive to parasitoids. If we want to help out parasitoids in the field, in order to increase their numbers and therefore help them control pests, we need to know more about how the microbial cues produced by nectar yeasts influence learning of floral preferences by parasitoids. This is what we set out to achieve in a recent experiment.  We wanted to find out whether frequent visits by parasitoids to flowers predisposes them to learn and remember the smell of tasty, energy-rich nectar produced by yeast. To this end, we investigated the learning ability and memory retention of an aphid parasitoid (aphids cause tremendous yield losses in crops worldwide) when exposed to volatile mixtures emitted from nectars. These nectars were artificially synthesised and fermented by various nectar yeasts, mimicking natural nectars. We showed that naïve aphid parasitoids (those inexperienced to smell and food) had an innate (inborn) preference for nectar colonised by specific nectar yeasts. When parasitoids were trained, by allowing them to feed on a filter paper saturated with yeast-fermented nectar for two minutes, something that was repeated three times, they were very strongly attracted to these and other yeast-fermented nectars for the next 24 hours. This shows that when parasitoids are trained they are able to forage for nectar much faster in the field. Our findings may have practical implications in enhancing the effectiveness of parasitoids to be used in biological control programs against aphids. They promote the possibility that parasitoids, owing to such high learning ability, could be mass trained before field release to induce a specific response to yeast-fermented sugar solutions and improve their performance in finding food and aphid hosts. Such solutions could be offered in feeding stations to feed and retain the parasitoid populations in the field where natural food sources are limited. This would in turn improve the foraging efficiency of trained parasitoids and increase their overall efficacy in suppressing aphid populations."

Now such is the case in my home state of Vermont, just a stone throw away from my childhood hometown.
Reader “The Indomitable Snowman, Ph.D.” sent me a couple of aerial shots of what Lowell Mountain looks like today after wind energy proponents got their way and installed 21 wind turbines on it. Each are some 450 feet tall:

You’ll find many more far gorier photos in the Internet simply by Googling “Lowell Mountain Wind Project”.
Turned off when power is really needed
So how well is the Lowell Mountain wind project rescuing the climate? Not very well, it turns out.
Vermont Digger site here, for example, reports how in 2013 during a heat wave grid operator ISO New England asked Green Mountain Power (GMP) to take much of the windpark offline, citing “insufficient infrastructure” to transmit power from Lowell.
VtDigger writes:

Instead of using wind power, GMP was required to use more carbon-heavy and expensive fuels because ISO officials say the infrastructure used to transmit power from Lowell is insufficient.”
ISO New England then called on GMP “to fire up its four jet turbines and six diesel engines located elsewhere around the state to match the high demand.” So here we see that it’s not even enough for the wind to blow. You also have to hope that the wind park is also located in the right spot!
Of course Vermont No. 1 eco-knucklehead Governor Peter Shumlin was angered that the wind park’s power had been curtailed and demanded that the power be used. After all people like Shumlin fret that the green power that did not get fed in probably led to 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000011°C more theoretical global warming, give or take a few zeros, and so may have stressed a little bit a couple of microbes somewhere in the Arctic.
Lowell Mountain wind power was not the only power that got curtailed, by also another wind park in Vermont and one in Maine got cutailed, VtDigger reports. The reason: “transmission limitations”.
This is precisely the sort problems we are seeing with Germany’s North Sea wind parks, which are set up but have no sufficient infrastructure to transmit the power where it is needed. Green masterminds at work.
The Lowell Mountain wind park has accomplished one thing: It has destroyed an entire mountain area and the delicate biodiversity and ecosystem surrounding it.  That’s a hell of price to pay for the theoretical 0.000000000000001°C or so less global warming the park will lead to.
I’m curious to know just how much power the 64.5 megawatt project actually produced over its first year of operation and percentage of rated capacity that was. I suspect it was probably even lower than the urine-poor results we’ve seen in Baden Wurttemberg.
“The Indomitable Snowman, Ph.D.” comments in his e-mail:
The other silly part is that this kind of stuff is being brought to us by the same people who, for years, fought tooth-and-nail against the construction of little tiny mobile communications towers on the same ridgelines – on the grounds that they amounted to ‘visual pollution’.  With these, they’re even trying to get artists to create agitprop to convince people that these things are beautiful; the infamous totalitarian regimes of the 20th century were always conscripting ‘artists’ into ‘the cause’ in the same way.”
Why do morons like Shumlin and their destruction remind me of this? It took nature hundreds of thousands of years to form Vermont’s mountains.

"The Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Dvorak’s “Rusalka” may be the unlikeliest hit of the season, a staging that takes opera’s answer to “The Little Mermaid” fairy tale and turns it into an almost shockingly dark, sexy drama. The mysterious look of the production, fantastical and ominous, combines with the sensual singing of a handsome cast to create a romantic energy rare at the Met  —   or at any opera house. When this project was first announced, “Rusalka” seemed a promising match for the director Mary Zimmerman, best known for casting fairy tale magic in her Tony   “Metamorphoses. ” But many were wary. Her three previous productions for the company, though full of ideas, were all variously disappointing. With this “Rusalka,” though, Ms. Zimmerman comes into her own as a director at the Met. Working with the set designer Daniel Ostling, the costume designer Mara Blumenfeld and the lighting designer T. J. Gerckens, Ms. Zimmerman has explored the dark complexities of this fable. At the opening on Thursday, Mark Elder conducted a glowing account of Dvorak’s score. And the Met has assembled a matchless cast, led by the lovely soprano Kristine Opolais, who gives a vocally lustrous and achingly vulnerable performance as Rusalka, the water nymph who falls in love with a human prince. Even in the unusual love scenes between the prince and the silent Rusalka, who has given up her voice to become mortal, Ms. Zimmerman has coaxed simmering tension from Ms. Opolais and the dashing tenor Brandon Jovanovich. The director has said that this opera carries a wise warning: If you have to transform yourself drastically, to the point of literally losing your voice, for the sake of love, the relationship may well be doomed. That theme comes through in every element of this haunting production, whose intensity coexists with a sense of disorientation: Ms. Zimmerman has subtly destabilized almost every aspect of the work. The opening scene is set in a meadow by a pond, and in this staging, everything seems a little off. The pond is a forbidding pool from which mists slowly spew the willow tree on which Rusalka rests is twisted and creepy. Dancing wood sprites (including a singing trio: Hyesang Park, Megan Marino and Cassandra Zoé Velasco) prance around in curiously ornate costumes, with frilly foliage skirts and headdresses of prickly twigs. As Vodnik, the water gnome who presides over the meadow, the earthy, stentorian   Eric Owens looks endearingly foolish in a   robe and crown. When Rusalka, who is Vodnik’s daughter, starts to tell her father about her sorrows and longing, Ms. Opolais, with golden hair and a   gaze, wears an aqua gown with long, flowing trails, almost like rivulets of lake water. The cumbersome dress weighs her down: This is just one detail of many with which Ms. Zimmerman suggests that Rusalka is not just part of, but bound by, the natural world. And with her fidgety physical gestures and darting eyes, Ms. Opolais conveys the character’s restlessness and pining. This powerful singing actress adds unusual intensity to her plaintive “Song to the Moon,” Rusalka’s famed lament, suggesting the character’s defiant side more than most sopranos. Ms. Zimmerman and her design team have mixed periods to create an atmosphere of unease. The athletic Mr. Jovanovich wears an   hunting coat, and as the witch Jezibaba, who dwells in the forest but straddles the human and supernatural worlds, the powerhouse   Jamie Barton is made up like a Victorian matron (though the cobweb patterns on her dress are a surreal touch). Rusalka goes to Jezibaba in desperation to ask for a potion that can turn her into a human. Ms. Barton’s chortling Jezibaba says she’ll help, but the witch warns Rusalka that she will become mute to all humans, including the prince. The transformation takes place atop a   surgical table, attended to by a valet and a maid who are here dressed as a giant, eerie mouse and a crow. Ms. Zimmerman presses a dark vision of the patriarchal oppression at the root of the fairy tale. At the start of their first love scene, the prince, thinking that Rusalka, now wearing a white sleeveless dress, looks vulnerable, wraps her in his cloak. When she finally succumbs to his passion, Mr. Jovanovich lifts Ms. Opolais into his arms. The staging suggests that the reborn Rusalka may not really be free, but is simply adapting to a new set of strictures. Loving the prince means submitting to him. In the prince’s castle in Act II, Ms. Opolais’s Rusalka seems like a lost waif as a strange ballroom dance takes place around her, with the courtly participants going through all manner of angular, jutting movements. (The choreographer is Austin McCormick, in his Met debut.) A rival for the prince appears, called simply the Foreign Princess in the libretto and here played formidably by the Wagnerian soprano Katarina Dalayman, who feeds the prince’s exasperation with Rusalka’s unnerving silence and oddly cold embraces. By the end of the opera, when Rusalka has fled the castle and returned to her pond, Ms. Zimmerman has turned the meadow gray and dank the set’s scaffolding is partly exposed. Or is this just the way it appears to Rusalka? Perhaps she now sees, with painful clarity, the bare beams that prop up the seemingly rich natural world. The prince has gone in search of Rusalka, and finds her: Now, finally, the two have a real love duet, impassioned, fitful music, sung here with burnished sound and wrenching beauty by Ms. Opolais and Mr. Jovanovich. But the doomed Rusalka has become a moonlit phantom, as she warns the prince. By kissing her, he dies. In a final directorial gesture, before heading alone into the forest, Rusalka puts on the prince’s coat. This time, though, it seems a token of remembrance."
"WASHINGTON  —   It was at a campaign rally in August that President Trump most fully unveiled the dark vision of an America under siege by “radical Islam” that is now radically reshaping the policies of the United States. On a stage lined with American flags in Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Trump, who months before had called for a “total and complete shutdown” of Muslim immigration, argued that the United States faced a threat on par with the greatest evils of the 20th century. The Islamic State was brutalizing the Middle East, and Muslim immigrants in the West were killing innocents at nightclubs, offices and churches, he said. Extreme measures were needed. “The hateful ideology of radical Islam,” he told supporters, must not be “allowed to reside or spread within our own communities. ” Mr. Trump was echoing a strain of   theorizing familiar to anyone who has been immersed in security and counterterrorism debates over the last 20 years. He has embraced a deeply suspicious view of Islam that several of his aides have promoted, notably retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, now his national security adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s top strategist. This worldview borrows from the “clash of civilizations” thesis of the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, and combines straightforward warnings about extremist violence with   critiques of Islam. It sometimes conflates terrorist groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State with largely nonviolent groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and its offshoots and, at times, with the 1. 7 billion Muslims around the world. In its more extreme forms, this view promotes conspiracies about government infiltration and the danger that Shariah, the legal code of Islam, may take over in the United States. Those espousing such views present Islam as an inherently hostile ideology whose adherents are enemies of Christianity and Judaism and seek to conquer nonbelievers either by violence or through a sort of stealthy brainwashing. The executive order on immigration that Mr. Trump signed on Friday might be viewed as the first major victory for this geopolitical school. And a second action, which would designate the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political movement in the Middle East, as a terrorist organization, is now under discussion at the White House, administration officials say. Beyond the restrictions the order imposed on refugees and visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, it declared that the United States should keep out those with “hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles” and “those who would place violent ideologies over American law,” clearly a reference to Shariah. Rejected by most serious scholars of religion and shunned by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, this dark view of Islam has nonetheless flourished on the fringes of the American right since before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. With Mr. Trump’s election, it has now moved to the center of American   on security and law, alarming many Muslims. Mr. Trump has insisted that the executive order is not a “Muslim ban,” and his supporters say it is a sensible precaution to safeguard Americans. Asked about the seeming antipathy to Islam that appeared to inform the order, the White House pointed to Mr. Trump’s comments in the August speech and on another occasion that signaled support for   Muslims. His administration, Mr. Trump said in August, “will be a friend to all moderate Muslim reformers in the Middle East, and will amplify their voice. ” James Jay Carafano, a security expert at the Heritage Foundation who advised the Trump transition at the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, said the executive order was simply “trying to get ahead of the threat. ” As pressure increases on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, he said, “tens of thousands of foreign fighters” will flee. Some could try to reach America, perhaps posing as refugees, he said, so stronger vetting of those entering the country is crucial. But critics see the order as a clumsy show of toughness against foreign Muslims to impress Mr. Trump’s base, one shaped by advisers with distorted ideas about Islam. “They’re tapping into the climate of fear and suspicion since ” said Asma Afsaruddin, a professor of Islamic studies at Indiana University and chairwoman of the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy. “It’s a master narrative that pits the Muslim world against the West,” appealing to Trump supporters who know nothing of Muslims or Islam beyond news reports of terrorist attacks, she said. The executive order, she said, will backfire by reinforcing the jihadist line that the United States is at war with Islam. “The White House is a huge soapbox,” she said. “The demonization of Muslims and Islam will become even more widespread. ” Those in the administration with long records of criticizing Islam begin with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Flynn. Mr. Flynn last February tweeted a link to an   video and wrote, “Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL. ” In an interview, he said that “Islam is not necessarily a religion but a political system that has a religious doctrine behind it. ” Mr. Bannon has spoken passionately about the economic and security dangers of immigration and took the lead role in shaping the immigration order. In a 2014 talk to a meeting at the Vatican, he said the “  West” is at war with Islam. “There is a major war brewing, a war that’s already global,” he said. “Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the scale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn’t act. ” Elsewhere, on his radio show for Breitbart News, Mr. Bannon said, “Islam is not a religion of peace  —   Islam is a religion of submission,” and he warned of Muslim influence in Europe: “To be brutally frank, Christianity is dying in Europe and Islam is on the rise. ” Others with similar views of Islam include Sebastian Gorka, who taught at the National Defense University and is a deputy national security adviser. Mr. Gorka’s wife, Katharine, who headed think tanks that focused on the dangers of Islam, now works at the Department of Homeland Security. Tera Dahl, who was an aide to former Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, is a National Security Council official. Walid Phares, a Lebanese American Christian who has advised politicians on counterterrorism, advised Mr. Trump’s campaign but does not currently have a government post. All four have written for Breitbart News, the   website previously run by Mr. Bannon. They all reflect the   opinions of what some have described as the Islamophobia industry, a network of researchers who have warned for many years of the dangers of Islam and were thrilled by Mr. Trump’s election. They warn about the danger to American freedoms supposedly posed by Islamic law, and have persuaded several state legislatures to prohibit Shariah’s use. It is a claim that draws eye rolls from most Muslims and scholars of Islam, since Muslims make up about 1 percent of the United States population and are hardly in a position to dictate to the other 99 percent. “The majority of Muslims don’t interpret the Quran literally,” said Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution. “You can have five Muslims who all say we think this is God’s exact words, but they all disagree with each other on what that means in practice. ” Among the most outspoken of those warning about Islam are Pamela Geller, of Stop Islamization of America, Robert Spencer, of Jihad Watch, and Frank Gaffney Jr. of the Center for Security Policy. All three were hosted by Mr. Bannon on his Breitbart radio program before he became chief executive of the Trump campaign in August. Mr. Gaffney appeared at least 34 times. His work has often been cited in speeches by Mr. Flynn. Kellyanne Conway, now counselor to Mr. Trump, did polling for Mr. Gaffney’s center. Last year, the center gave Senator Jeff Sessions, who has warned of the “totalitarian threat” posed by radical Islam and is Mr. Trump’s nominee for attorney general, its annual “Keeper of the Flame” award. Mr. Gaffney has been labeled “one of America’s most notorious Islamophobes” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The   League describes him as a “purveyor of   conspiracy theories. ” And even the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual meeting of   politicians and activists, banned Mr. Gaffney temporarily after he accused two of its organizers of being agents of the Muslim Brotherhood. In an interview, he explained his view of Islam, which focuses less on the violent jihad of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State than on the quieter one he sees everywhere. By his account, potential enemies are hidden in plain sight  —   praying in mosques, recruiting at Muslim student associations and organizing through mainstream Muslim rights groups  —   and are engaged in “this stealthy, subversive kind of jihad. ” “They essentially, like termites, hollow out the structure of the civil society and other institutions,” Mr. Gaffney said, “for the purpose of creating conditions under which the jihad will succeed. ” The day after the election, Mr. Gaffney told the Breitbart radio show how pleased he was with Mr. Trump’s win. “It is a great blessing literally from God, but also I think obviously from the candidate himself, Donald Trump,” he said. He praised the “superb people” around Mr. Trump, naming Mr. Bannon and Mr. Flynn, who he said “are actually going to lead us to saving the Republic. ”"

From the University of New South Wales and Dr. Steven Sherwood:
“Climate sceptics like to criticise climate models for getting things wrong, and we are the first to admit they are not perfect,” said Sherwood. “But what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by the models which predict less warming, not those that predict more.”
Yeah…right:

Cloud mystery solved: Global temperatures to rise at least 4°C by 2100
Cloud impact on climate sensitivity unveiled
Global average temperatures will rise at least 4°C by 2100 and potentially more than 8°C by 2200 if carbon dioxide emissions are not reduced according to new research published in Nature. Scientists found global climate is more sensitive to carbon dioxide than most previous estimates.

The research also appears to solve one of the great unknowns of climate sensitivity, the role of cloud formation and whether this will have a positive or negative effect on global warming.
“Our research has shown climate models indicating a low temperature response to a doubling of carbon dioxide from preindustrial times are not reproducing the correct processes that lead to cloud formation,” said lead author from the University of New South Wales’ Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science Prof Steven Sherwood.
“When the processes are correct in the climate models the level of climate sensitivity is far higher. Previously, estimates of the sensitivity of global temperature to a doubling of carbon dioxide ranged from 1.5°C to 5°C. This new research takes away the lower end of climate sensitivity estimates, meaning that global average temperatures will increase by 3°C to 5°C with a doubling of carbon dioxide.”
The key to this narrower but much higher estimate can be found in the real world observations around the role of water vapour in cloud formation.
Observations show when water vapour is taken up by the atmosphere through evaporation, the updraughts can either rise to 15 km to form clouds that produce heavy rains or rise just a few kilometres before returning to the surface without forming rain clouds.
When updraughts rise only a few kilometres they reduce total cloud cover because they pull more vapour away from the higher cloud forming regions.
However water vapour is not pulled away from cloud forming regions when only deep 15km updraughts are present.
The researchers found climate models that show a low global temperature response to carbon dioxide do not include enough of this lower-level water vapour process. Instead they simulate nearly all updraughts as rising to 15 km and forming clouds.
When only the deeper updraughts are present in climate models, more clouds form and there is an increased reflection of sunlight. Consequently the global climate in these models becomes less sensitive in its response to atmospheric carbon dioxide.
However, real world observations show this behaviour is wrong.
When the processes in climate models are corrected to match the observations in the real world, the models produce cycles that take water vapour to a wider range of heights in the atmosphere, causing fewer clouds to form as the climate warms.
This increases the amount of sunlight and heat entering the atmosphere and, as a result, increases the sensitivity of our climate to carbon dioxide or any other perturbation.
The result is that when water vapour processes are correctly represented, the sensitivity of the climate to a doubling of carbon dioxide – which will occur in the next 50 years – means we can expect a temperature increase of at least 4°C by 2100.
“Climate sceptics like to criticize climate models for getting things wrong, and we are the first to admit they are not perfect, but what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by those models which predict less warming, not those that predict more,” said Prof. Sherwood.
“Rises in global average temperatures of this magnitude will have profound impacts on the world and the economies of many countries if we don’t urgently start to curb our emissions.

"President Trump on Friday moved to chisel away at the Obama administration’s legacy on financial regulation, announcing steps to revisit the rules enacted after the 2008 financial crisis and to back away from a measure intended to protect consumers from bad investment advice. After a White House meeting with executives from Wall Street, Mr. Trump signed a directive aimed at the   Act, crafted by the Obama administration and passed by Congress in response to the 2008 meltdown. He also signed a memorandum that paves the way for reversing a policy, known as the fiduciary rule, that requires brokers to act in a client’s best interest, rather than seek the highest profits for themselves, when providing retirement advice. The executive order affecting   is vague in its wording and expansive in its reach. It never mentions the law by name, instead laying out “core principles” for regulations that include empowering American investors and enhancing the competitiveness of American companies. Even so, it gives the Treasury the authority to restructure major provisions of   and it directs the Treasury secretary to make sure existing laws align with administration goals. Mr. Trump’s action on the fiduciary rule, which Democrats and consumer groups immediately denounced as a gift to Wall Street, could have a more concrete impact. His memorandum directs the Labor Department to review whether the rule may “adversely affect” investors’ ability to access financial advice  —   and if it does, it authorizes the agency to rescind and revise the rule. Supporters of the rule describe it as a basic consumer protection to prevent brokers from taking advantage of vulnerable clients. The industry argues that the rule will expose it to a torrent of lawsuits and will increase costs that firms will pass on to consumers. Taken together, Mr. Trump’s actions on Friday constitute an extensive effort to loosen regulations on banks and other major financial companies, even though the president campaigned as a champion of working Americans and as a critic of Wall Street elites. Mr. Trump said on Friday that his actions were intended to help both Wall Street and workers as his administration eases constraints on banks and allows them to lend more to companies, which could then hire more workers. “We expect to be cutting a lot out of   because frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that had nice businesses, they can’t borrow money,” Mr. Trump said in the State Dining Room during his meeting with business leaders. “They just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in  . ” The 2010 act reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading and curbed the ability of banks to trade with their own money in a measure known as the Volcker Rule. Despite the president’s concerns, banks have increased their consumer lending like credit cards and auto loans, and have generally expanded their lending to businesses. As he announced his goals on financial deregulation, Mr. Trump sat beside Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity giant the Blackstone Group and the chairman of his business council, who said the panel would “advise the government on the areas where we could do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans. ” The president had praise for Jamie Dimon, whose bank, JPMorgan Chase, was often a target of regulatory actions by the Obama administration. “There’s nobody better to tell me about   than Jamie, so you’re going to tell me about it,” Mr. Trump said. The meeting underscored the degree to which the architects of Mr. Trump’s economic strategy are now some of the people he denounced in his campaign, which ended with a commercial that described “a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations. ” The advertisement flashed an image of the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, which has become a virtual feeder for top Trump administration officials. Steven Mnuchin, his nominee for Treasury secretary Gary Cohn, the chairman of his national economic council and Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, all had worked at Goldman. “The administration apparently plans to turn over financial regulation to Wall Street titan Goldman Sachs, and make it easier for them and other big banks like Wells Fargo to steal from their customers and destabilize the economy,” said Lisa Donner, the executive director of Americans for Financial Reform, an advocacy group that supports  . “That betrays the promises Trump made to stand up to Wall Street. ” The president’s actions came just hours after congressional Republicans voted to repeal an unrelated   rule, a sign that Mr. Trump will have some support on Capitol Hill to challenge a law he has called “a disaster,” and promised to do “a big number” to reshape. Now emboldened, House Republicans are also moving legislation to “repeal and replace”   though they would need 60 votes to accomplish that, which seems unlikely. And they are considering potential ways to use the budget process to defund some aspects of the law, all of which comes on top of the president’s executive actions. While the president cannot unwind   with the stroke of a pen, his orders set the tone for the regulatory agencies enforcing the rules, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. And the orders could portend even more executive actions that direct the regulators to halt financial regulation. The president’s approach to regulation sharply contrasts with his predecessor. President Barack Obama once remarked, “I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street. ” Wall Street is expected to lobby Mr. Trump’s financial regulators, at the S. E. C. and elsewhere, to modify rules and enforce them lightly. But there is a limit to what the regulators can do.   is still the law, and it requires the regulators to enforce hundreds of   rules. Under administrative law, the regulators must also formally propose any new rules and seek public comment. The Trump administration may have an easier time voiding the   Labor Department rule requiring brokers to act in a client’s best interest when providing retirement advice. That rule is not explicitly part of  . White House officials had considered a far more aggressive assault on the fiduciary rule, which would have immediately halted it for six months or more while the Labor Department reviewed its effects. The final memorandum appears to leave the regulation in place, but it also goes a step further, instructing the department to undertake what could be a lengthy new process for rewriting the rule if it is found to harm investors or financial companies. “President Trump’s action will make it harder for American savers to keep more of what they earn,” Senator Sherrod Brown, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. But Representative Ann Wagner, Republican of Missouri, called the effort to stop the fiduciary rule “a labor of love for me. ” Even before the president acted, congressional Republicans on Friday started to chip away at  . The Republicans used an unusual parliamentary procedure to repeal a rule that stems from the law with only a majority of votes, rather than the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. The Senate voted 52 to 47 to void the rule, which requires oil companies to publicly disclose payments made to governments when developing resources around the world. The rule, which   assigned to the S. E. C. to enforce, was tangential to the law’s mission of reforming Wall Street, but lawmakers included it anyway with the hope of exposing bribes and corruption. Some of the largest American oil companies objected to the S. E. C. rule, including Exxon Mobil, arguing that it put them at a competitive disadvantage with foreign companies. Rex W. Tillerson, Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, personally lobbied against it when he was Exxon’s top executive, according to public accounts. Republicans are not done. Under the Congressional Review Act of 1996, Congress has at least 60 days to introduce legislation repealing major new regulations. Already this week, Republicans introduced legislation under the act to repeal a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule for prepaid debit cards. The Congressional Research Service has determined that rules sent to Congress on or after June 13 last year are vulnerable to repeal. The S. E. C. rule just missed that cutoff it became final on June 27, making it fair game for Republicans to repeal, over the objections of antipoverty groups like Oxfam and the One Campaign. “If President Trump is serious about his promise to ‘drain the swamp’ and protect American security, he will veto this dangerous bill immediately,” Isabel Munilla, an Oxfam official, said in a statement."

“Sustainability” is not a good way to think about things. “‘Sustainability’ implies that our goal should be repetition: that we want to do something that can be repeated over and over and over.  
“But I think of life in terms of evolution or progress. We don’t want to do the same thing over and over and over, we want to find better and better ways of doing things…  
If people are free, and they are free to use energy and to use technology, they can have really good lives even in places with naturally inhospitable climates.  
“Is it sustainable [for a society] to live in poverty for 10,000 years? Well, yeah, that’s sustainable, but it’s not progressive. So I want to be progressive, not sustainable.”

"Our polar regions are in trouble. Sea ice is retreating, ice shelves are collapsing and the oceans are heating and acidifying. But what lies in store for these regions isn’t a simple story of doom and gloom. In the short term, Arctic and Antarctic waters are actually set to increase in economic value to humans – and this brings a different kind of threat to their future. Understanding how the polar boom fits into the bigger picture is essential to ensure these areas are given the protection they need. The Antarctic Ocean is the fourth-largest of the five major oceans, yet it alone accounts for more than one-third of heat gain across the top two kilometres of the world’s seas in the past 50 years. Temperatures there are rising much faster than the global average.

      IPCC report paints catastrophic picture of melting ice and rising sea levels – and reality may be even worse


 Along with a multi-disciplinary team of scientists from around the world, I recently reviewed what these changes mean for the Antarctic’s future. Some of the findings may appear surprisingly positive at first glance. As ice sheets retreat and the sea freezes for shorter periods, more water will be exposed in liquid form. As a result, microscopic algae – also known as phytoplankton, the critical base of the marine food chain – will actually increase in number. As photoysnthesising organisms, this means that Antarctic ecosystems are likely to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they could before. They may also support more fish – and with Antarctic waters freer of ice, fishing vessels will be able to catch them for more of the year. In the Arctic, fishers in the Barents Sea north of Norway are already benefiting from historically high numbers of Atlantic cod, which have moved north in search of cooler water. The poles are increasingly popular tourist destinations too. Small Inuit villages are regularly inundated with cruise ship passengers, and retreating sea ice will allow more vessels to explore previously inaccessible areas. If this makes climate breakdown sound rosy, be wary. Some quarters are bound to try to cash in on the increase in economic value of the polar regions – and perhaps even weaken the will to take urgent climate action by selling this warming as beneficial. To arm ourselves against these efforts, its important to understand that the “benefits” come with far more severe costs. First, while aspects of polar ecosystems that make humans money may strengthen in the short-term, many animals of less direct benefit will pay the price. Numerous studies show that Antarctic species dependent on krill and icy conditions, such as Adélie and macaroni penguins, are already declining. In the future, ice-dependent minke whales and pack-ice seals may lose much of the sea ice they depend on for foraging and reproduction. In the Arctic, harp seals and polar bears are likely to suffer the same fate, while narwhals may be exposed to new predators such as killer whales moving north. Increased fishing and tourism would put more pressure on these forms of life precisely when they most need protection from climate breakdown. Second, any benefits accruing to humans at the poles are coming at the expense of other ocean regions. For example, greater numbers of phytoplankton in the surface waters of the Antarctic will consume more nutrients, leaving less for currents to carry to ocean regions further north. Similarly, warmer surface oceans in these regions mix less with nutrient-rich deeper waters. Together, this means that any increase in phytoplankton and fish stocks at the poles will be more than counterbalanced by decreases elsewhere. And, while many species are migrating to cooler waters as oceans become uncomfortably warm, where there are large stretches of deep water in the way, species that live in coastal habitats are left with nowhere to go. Many species inhabiting Australia’s south coast such as the harlequin fish, are at risk of extinction for this reason. The coming decades pose an extremely challenging management scenario for those who wish to see the Antarctic and Arctic oceans healthy and protected. But there are a number of things the global community can do to help conserve the extraordinary marine life of polar ecosystems. First, we need to know more. Protecting marine species and ecosystems is extremely difficult, in part because we still don’t fully understand which species live where in the Antarctic and Arctic seas. More knowledge means better decision making. Second, governments and regulators need to send firm statements that the poles are not for sale. British and French sub-Antarctic territories such as the South Sandwich Islands and St Paul and Amsterdam are still not comprehensively protected. Rectifying this would be a good start. Similarly, organisations that manage fisheries and other marine industries should start quantifying how their activities affect wildlife. Where fishing and climate breakdown cause a species to decline in number, fisheries must be directed to reduce their exploitation to safe levels.

      A view to a krill: warming seas may leave predators hungry


 Finally, governments need to work together. Different areas of the polar oceans are managed by different nations, and a lack of communication is preventing them from being properly protected. A unified conservation effort could establish vast uninterrupted networks of protected areas. These would make it much easier for species and even entire ecosystems to move polewards as waters warm. But this won’t be enough to protect polar life in some cases. We may have to take radical measures to actively assist the migration of some species. And as species are already shifting across ocean boundaries, its not just polar ocean authorities that will need to link up, but authorities across the world. This in itself is a mark of just how severe and widespread our impact on marine ecosystems is. So let’s not make things worse by treating the polar oceans as a burgeoning economic resource. Instead, let’s give the life they contain the respect it deserves. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."

Having muscled their way to the front line in the nation’s political battles, state attorneys general are now in for getting roughed up along with the other partisan combatants.



The Republican Attorneys General Association, representing just over half the 50 state AGs, has voted to end a “rare bit of bipartisanship in the polarized environment of US politics,” to quote Reuters, which reported the news. It’s going to ditch an unspoken hands‐​off agreement with its rival Democratic Attorneys General Association under which each party targeted open seats only and held back from bankrolling challenges against the others’ incumbents.



Democrats are expected to respond in kind and start going after incumbent Republicans. If there were still any hope that the chief legal officers of the states could stay above the fray in some genteel way, it’s pretty much gone. Truth to tell, it’s been gone for years.





These days, packs of red‐ and blue‐​team AGs roam the political landscape looking for fights to get into, whether over ObamaCare, environmental regulation or immigration



As long ago as the 1970s, pushed by pressure groups and some in Washington, AGs began organizing into strike forces to file lawsuits with nationwide impact. One goal was to assert regulatory power over national businesses; another was to try out test‐​case litigation on the wider stage, not just within states.



Often the rationale was that progressive advocates had been unable to persuade Washington to act on some national problem, and someone needed to do something — right?



A stunning payoff came in 1998, when the multistate tobacco settlement bagged $246 billion‐​with‐​a‐​b, no small portion of which went as fees to private lawyers who had acted as partners.



Those numbers got everyone’s attention and drew more powerful players into the training, care, feeding and nervous placating of AGs.



Each year, AGs continue to harvest hundreds of millions of dollars in lawsuit settlements, which — depending on their state’s ground rules — they may funnel to allies in state government, nonprofits or cozied‐​up “community groups,” bypassing the ordinary course of legislative appropriations.



New York AG Eric Schneiderman wound up in a big fight with Gov. Cuomo over the eventual carve‐​up of bank‐​settlement money, but that script didn’t originate with him — or with New York.



Partisan polarization advanced another step in 1999, when RAGA was formed in the aftermath of the tobacco caper. DAGA followed in 2002. Both groups can serve to channel private donations and influence in ways that can be hard to trace.



Reuters reports, based on its sources, that “a desire by some to roll back same‐​sex marriage and the potential for increased corporate contributions played a role in [RAGA’s] decision” — not exactly inspiring motives, if you ask me.



Many Democratic AGs, for their part, have been using their powers of office to target thinkers, activists and donors on the opposite side.



Now‐​Sen. Kamala Harris, when she was California AG, pushed hard to force nonprofits active in the state to disclose the identity of their donors. The expected sequel: public shaming and boycott campaigns against those who give to right‐​of‐​center groups.



Her successor, former Rep. Xavier Becerra, just charged filmmaker David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt with 15 felonies. The two had taken secret films inside Planned Parenthood offices as part of an advocacy campaign.



Republican AGs in rural states have gone to bat for “ag‐​gag” laws making it a misdemeanor to take unauthorized recordings inside ranches and other animal operations; humane groups blast such laws as a First Amendment violation.



Meanwhile, environmental advocates finagled a group of AGs, including Schneiderman and Massachusetts’ Maura Healey, into aiming a subpoena dragnet at advocacy groups, scientists and activists engaged in climate change “denial” and other opinion sins. Officially couched as a fraud investigation of the Exxon Corp., it has featured subpoenas demanding the correspondence and documents of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a well‐​known right‐​of‐​center player in Washington.



Maryland AG Brian Frosh, another member of the group, has signaled plans to go after the American Legislative Exchange Council, a right‐​leaning group of state legislators that has been widely demonized on the left.



These days, packs of red‐ and blue‐​team AGs roam the political landscape looking for fights to get into, whether over ObamaCare, environmental regulation or immigration. (The battles over “standing” are always fun, since the opposing teams have been known to switch sides in a moment on the question of whether AGs belong in court challenging this or that federal policy at all.)



Washington’s and Hawaii’s Democratic AGs helped shoot down, for now, Trump’s travel bans, following the lead of AGs from Texas and 25 other states who made life hard for President Barack Obama on immigration matters.



Some of this is healthy, even to be applauded, but let’s face it: It’s politics. And if some of these AGs would rather pose at election time as impartial legal officers and above politics — well, it’s way too late for that.

In the era before coal, oil and electricity, the environment suffered greatly.



Whales were slaughtered for lamp oil; forests were cleared for firewood, mine props, building materials, roofing shingles and sailing masts; London (“The Big Smoke”) and Pittsburgh (“The Smoky City”) were smothered in smog from open fires, charcoal kilns and iron smelters; horses powered public and military transport and city streets were layered with horse manure.



Then came the hydro-carbon revolution. Kerosene lamps saved the whales and coal-powered steam engines delivered electricity (clean-coal-by-wire) to the cities – and much of the sulphurous smog disappeared. Coke from coal replaced wood charcoal to make iron and steel. Steel and concrete saved the forests and trucks and railways allowed the farmland which once fed millions of horses to produce food for humans.



Not one of these boons for humans AND the environment was driven by a UN resolution or funded by statutory levies on consumers, or subsidies from taxpayers. None were mandated in a government energy plan.



The anti-human, anti-industry policies of the Global Greens are now reversing all that progress.



A key event occurred in 2006 when a leading left-wing politician, Al Gore, invented the Global Warming Industry. Despite a finding by a British High Court judge that his movie “The Inconvenient Truth” contained **nine key scientific errors** , it is still shown in schools. This has misled students and teachers and created spreading circles of damage to jobs, industry and the cost and reliability of electricity. It also created the fake industries of climate hysteria and green activism.



The Green Piglets were born, and the environment and the economy suffered.



Land that once fed horses is now used to produce biodiesel and ethanol for cars, so food prices must go up. Forests are felled to burn in green power stations and for green-tick buildings, while grasslands are invaded by feral pests and woody weeds from the ever-growing parks and Kyoto Protocol Forests. Birds and bats are being sliced by wind turbines, flatlands are being smothered by solar panels, access roads and transmission lines. But electricity costs soar, supply is rationed while reliability crashes.



Behind every one of these modern maladies are troughs of Big Green Pigs getting fatter on market mandates, subsidies from consumers or taxpayers, and special tax treatments.



In the background, governments fund an academic/media industry promoting climate alarmism, energy rationing and intermittent energy. Electric cars and penny farthings were pushed off the roads by Henry Ford’s petrol engines, but politicians are trying to put them back – a Tesla for the rich and a bicycle for the poor. Consumers and industry don’t count and taxpayers are there to be milked. In this Greentopia no one needs miners, farmers or fishermen. All are lost for a fake global warming Emergency.

"During the Antarctic summer, thousands of mesmerising blue lakes form around the edges of the continent’s ice sheet, as warmer temperatures cause snow and ice to melt and collect into depressions on the surface. Colleagues of mine at Durham University have recently used satellites to record more than 65,000 of these lakes.  Though seasonal meltwater lakes have formed on the continent for decades, lakes had not been recorded before in such great numbers across coastal areas of East Antarctica. This means parts of the world’s largest ice sheet may be more vulnerable to a warming climate than previously thought. Much of Antarctica is surrounded by floating platforms of ice, often as tall as a skyscraper. These are “ice shelves”. And when some of these ice shelves have collapsed in the past, satellites have recorded networks of lakes growing and then abruptly disappearing shortly beforehand. For instance, several hundred lakes disappeared in the weeks before the the catastrophic disintegration of the Larsen B Ice Shelf – when 3,250 km² of ice broke up in just two months in 2002. The collapse may have depended on water from these lakes filling crevasses and then acting like a wedge as the weight of the water expanded the crevasses, triggering a network of fractures. The weight of lakes can also cause the ice shelf surface to flex, leading to further fracturing, which is thought to have helped the shelf become unstable and collapse.  Ice shelves act as door stops, supporting the huge mass of ice further inland. Their removal means the glaciers feeding the ice shelf are no longer held back and flow faster into the ocean, contributing to sea-level rise. Scientists already knew that lakes form on the Antarctic ice sheet. But the latest study, published in Scientific Reports, shows that many more lakes are forming than previously thought, including in new parts of the ice sheet and much further inland and at higher elevations. Since the cold and remoteness makes it logistically challenging to measure and monitor Antarctica’s lakes in the field, we largely know all this thanks to satellite imagery. In this case, one of the satellites used was the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 which provides global coverage of the Earth’s surface every five days and can detect features as small as ten metres.  My colleagues analysed satellite images of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet taken in January 2017. In total, the images covered 5,000,000 km² (that’s more than 20 times the area of the United Kingdom).  Because water reflects certain wavelengths very strongly compared to ice, lakes can be detected in these images by classifying pixels in the image as “water” or “non-water”. From these images we can pinpoint when lakes form, their growth and drainage, and how their extent and depth change over time. The largest lake detected so far was nearly 30 km long and estimated to hold enough water to fill 40,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. In a warming world, scientists are particularly interested in these lakes because they may contribute to destabilising the ice shelves and ice sheet in future. Like a sponge, the more that ice shelves become saturated with meltwater, the less they are able to absorb, meaning more water pools on their surfaces as lakes. More surface lakes mean a greater likelihood that water will drain out, fill crevasses and potentially trigger flexing and fracturing. If this were to occur, other ice shelves around Antarctica may start to disintegrate like Larsen B. Glaciers with floating ice tongues protruding into the ocean may also be vulnerable. Meanwhile in Greenland, scientists have observed entire lakes draining away within a matter of days, as meltwater plunges through vertical shafts in the ice sheet known as “moulins”. A warm, wet base lubricated by meltwater allows the ice to slide quicker and flow faster into the ocean.  Could something similar be happening in Antarctica? Lakes disappearing in satellite imagery suggests they could be draining in this way, but scientists have yet to observe this directly. If we are to understand how much ice the continent could lose, and how much it could contribute to global sea-level rise, we must understand how these surface meltwater lakes behave. Though captivating, they are potentially a warning sign of future instability in Antarctica.  Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

"A million species face extinction unless we radically change how we live. As conservation scientists, our lives are focused on stopping this from happening. But despite a stream of grave warnings from the research community, we’ve witnessed firsthand just how powerless we are to do so through the usual channels of influence. That’s why we’ve been putting aside our usual research to engage in activism and are calling on other scientists to do the same – to act on our warnings to humanity. Our paper laying out this case, published in Nature Ecology & Evolution, caused quite a stir – it’s now in the top 0.007% most shared and talked about papers since measurement began in 2012. We think that this is at least in part because researchers are finding that the “proper” channels they’ve been taught to use to inform and influence policy – such as publishing scientific papers, working on reports and policy documents for governments, and speaking to policymakers at intergovernmental summits – are not working at the scale needed. This has certainly been our experience. Claire has spent the last few years compiling and communicating the scientific evidence for what works in conservation. There is more evidence than ever on how to save species and habitats. Yet we are still losing them with astonishing speed. While Claire’s own work was referenced by Lord Krebs – a zoologist and former member of the UK’s independent advisory body on climate change – to urge the UK government to make their 25 Year Environment Plan evidence based, his plea fell on deaf ears. Many of the proposed measures in the plan also involve voluntary regulation rather than passing laws, even though voluntary approaches have been shown to be mostly ineffective.  The plan also discusses expanding Marine Conservation Zones in the UK. The most effective marine protected areas ban fishing and other activities. This helps conserve scallop beds, cold water corals, kelp forests and other magical habitats and creatures hidden under British oceans. Yet most marine protected areas in the UK are little more than lines on maps with no restrictions. Divers testifying to the UK’s environmental audit committee described one as being dredged and trawled to the point of being a “barren wasteland of silt and sand that is devoid of life”. As someone who’s been to and worked on UK marine conservation zones, this is incredibly frustrating. What’s the point in collecting and communicating evidence if governments won’t listen to it? Charlie spent ten years living and working in Madagascar – one of the world’s top conservation priorities for its abundant unique species – where he helped establish new protected areas. But while this is a great achievement for policy on paper, the reality on the ground is rather sadder. Many of these areas are also “protected” in little more than name, and their managers lack the funding to adequately manage them. As a result, they are not working as effectively as they should, and Madagascar is still losing its biodiversity at alarming rates. Human-caused climate breakdown is compounding biodiversity loss in Madagascar. For example, it’s increasingly disrupting the south’s rainy season, causing crops to fail. In a protected area where Charlie worked, this caused farmers to turn to charcoal production, damaging the dwindling forests that many of Madagascar’s population depend on to subsist and make a living.  As one of the poorest countries in the world, Madagascar’s government can’t pay for all the conservation measures necessary to address the threats its wildlife faces. The industrialised world has the resources and the responsibility to do so, but its efforts have been woefully insufficient. In fact, the amount spent worldwide on nature conservation has only been about as much as the UK spends on ice cream. Scientists have long been urging governments to alter the fate of species and ecosystems in Madagascar and around the world by putting wildlife and climate at the heart of policy. But there are powerful opposite pulls too – fossil fuel, fishing, and many other industries spend millions lobbying governments to prioritise economic growth over environmental concerns and spreading climate denial.  Some quarters of the media still give more attention to royal babies than the threat of mass extinction, while others actively propagate an anti-climate science agenda. Non-violent civil disobedience practised by the Greta Thunberg-inspired youth strikes, Extinction Rebellion, and similar social movements around the world, is balancing the scales of influence. These movements have been instrumental in bringing public environmental concern to all-time highs in Britain and across the world. Crucially, these efforts are showing signs of impacting policy in a way that scientists have not been able to through official channels. In less than a year, the UK government has for the first time acknowledged in law the environment and climate emergency, and given citizens new power – albeit non-binding – to address it.

      Citizens' assemblies: how to bring the wisdom of the public to bear on the climate emergency


 While these are important milestones, there’s still a lot of work to do. To truly protect the planet we’ve spent our academic careers working to conserve, we need concrete, urgent, and radical action. In our experience, writing scientific papers and speaking to policymakers alone won’t bring this about. But civil disobedience just might. When these movements hit the streets, we think that conservationists, and indeed all scientists, should be out in force supporting them. This doesn’t have to mean arrest – we can give talks, act as media spokespeople, or support organisational tasks. Our voices could be much louder in this sphere than in government halls. Whatever we choose to do, it may be one of our last chances to conserve the beautiful life on this planet. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

In this post, we’ll discuss a recent article and blog post about the recently published England et al. (2014). This post includes portions of past posts and a number of new discussions and illustrations.
We’ve already discussed (post here) the paper England et al. (2014) Recent intensification of wind-driven circulation in the Pacific and the ongoing warming hiatus. Since then, NBC News has an article by John Roach with the curious title Global Warming Pause? The Answer Is Blowin’ Into the Wind. And the team from RealClimate have agreed and disagreed with England et al. (2014) in their post Going with the wind.
I find it surprising that England et al. is getting so much attention. It’s simply another paper that shows quite plainly that the past and current generations of climate models are fatally flawed…because they cannot simulate coupled ocean atmosphere processes that cause global surface temperatures to warm and that stop that warming. Maybe the attention results from their use of “wind” as a metric. Everyone understands the word wind.
A FEW PRELIMINARY COMMENTS
We’ve illustrated and discussed in past posts how the current generation of global models cannot simulate how, when and where the surfaces of the oceans have warmed since 1880 and during the satellite era. See the posts:

CMIP5 Model-Data Comparison: Satellite-Era Sea Surface Temperature Anomalies
Models Fail: Land versus Sea Surface Warming Rates
IPCC Still Delusional about Carbon Dioxide


We’ve also illustrated this recently, but as a reminder: The sea surface temperature anomalies of the tropical Pacific are a part of this discussion, because that’s where El Niño and La Niña events take place, and because that’s where the trade winds in question blow. The satellite-enhanced sea surface temperature data for the tropical Pacific show that the surface of the tropical Pacific has not warmed over the past 32+ years—the full term of the Reynolds OI.v2 sea surface temperature data. See Figure 1. On the other hand, climate models indicate that, if the surface temperatures of the tropical Pacific were warmed by manmade greenhouse gases, they should have warmed more than 0.6 deg C (or about 1.1 deg F).

Figure 1
So the problems with climate models are not limited to the past decade and a half.
OVERVIEW OF ENGLAND ET AL. (2014)
England et al. (2014) are basically claiming that stronger trade winds in recent years are driving CO2-based global warming into the depths of the Pacific Ocean, and that the stronger trade winds are associated with a shift in the frequency, magnitude and duration of El Niño and La Niña events. They use an abstract metric called the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) to define the periods when El Niño or La Niña events dominated.
As an expanded overview of England et al., during the period from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s, the trade winds were weaker because El Niño events dominated, so, according to their modeling efforts, more global warming was occurring at the surface. But since the late 1990s, the stronger trade winds associated with more-frequent La Niñas are causing the CO2-based global warming to be driven into the depths of the Pacific Ocean.
Figure 2 presents a commonly used index for the strength, frequency and duration of El Niño and La Niña events. It is a graph of the sea surface temperature anomalies of the NINO3.4 region. I’ve also highlighted NOAA’s official El Niño and La Niña events, based on their Oceanic NINO Index (but the data in the graph are not from the Oceanic NINO Index). And as we can see, there were a series of strong and long El Niño events from 1982 through 1998: the 1982/83, the 1986/87/88 and the 1997/98 El Niños. Although the series of El Niños in the first half of the 1990s are now considered independent events, Trenberth and Hoar proclaimed them as one long event in their 1996 paper The 1990-1995 El Niño-Southern Oscillation Event: Longest on record. The El Niño events since 1998 have not been as strong, and the frequency of La Niña events has increased.

Figure 2
Because trade winds are weak during El Niños and strong during La Niñas, the change in the frequencies of El Niño and La Niña events indicate the trade wind should have increased during that time…and they have. We illustrated and discussed this in the recent post El Niño and La Niña Basics: Introduction to the Pacific Trade Winds.
But that’s not where the problems exist with the findings of England et al. (2014).
THE BASIC PROBLEMS WITH ENGLAND ET AL. (2014)
England et al. (2014) have the same problems as the recent Trenberth papers. I discussed those in my Open Letter to Kevin Trenberth – NCAR. The following is a revised portion of that post. I’ve changed a few of the graphs to reflect the differences in the start date for the hiatus. Trenberth used 1999 in one of his recent papers, while England et al. used 2001.
Based on England et al (2014), the ocean heat content of the western tropical Pacific should be increasing during the hiatus period. As noted earlier, England et al. used 2001 as the start of the hiatus. Figure 3 presents the NODC ocean heat content for the western tropical Pacific (24S-24N, 120E-180), for the depths of 0-700 meters, for the period of January 2001 to December 2013. We can see that the western tropical Pacific to depths of 700 meters has, in fact, warmed.

Figure 3
Before we proceed, let’s confirm that the variability in the ocean heat content of the tropical Pacific takes place in the top 700 meters. The Tropical Atmosphere-Ocean (TAO) project buoys have sampled subsurface temperatures, etc., in the tropical Pacific since the early 1990s, so the NODC data should be a reasonably reliable there. Over the past decade, ARGO floats have supplemented the TAO buoys. And now for the data: the source Ocean Heat Content data in the tropical Pacific for the depths of 0-700 meters and 0-2000 meters (represented by the unadjusted UKMO EN3 data) during the TAO project and ARGO eras are exactly the same, see Figure 4, and that suggests that all of the variability in the tropical Pacific ocean heat content is taking place in the top 700 meters.

Figure 4
Back to our discussion of the hiatus period: The NODC ocean heat content data also show the ocean heat content (0-700m) of the eastern tropical Pacific, a much larger region, has been cooling from 2001 to 2013. See Figure 5.

Figure 5
As a result, there has been an overall decrease (not increase) in the ocean heat content of the tropical Pacific since 2001, Figure 6, and a substantial decrease in the ocean heat content of the tropical Pacific as a whole since the peak around 2004.

Figure 6
Therefore, based on data, there appears to have been a rearrangement of heat within the tropical Pacific and not an addition of heat as suggested by England et al. (2014).
Also, in the recent post If Manmade Greenhouse Gases Are Responsible for the Warming of the Global Oceans… I presented the NODC’s vertical mean temperature anomaly data for the Indian, Pacific, North Atlantic and South Atlantic Oceans, for the depths of 0-2000 meters, during the ARGO era (starting in 2003). Figure 7 is an update of that illustration, including the recently released 2013 data. The flatness of the Pacific trend indicates there has not been a substantial increase in the subsurface temperatures of the entire Pacific Ocean to depths of 2000 meters over the past 11 years…same with the North Atlantic. It cannot be claimed that manmade greenhouse gases caused the warming in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, when they obviously have had no impact on the warming of the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to 2000 meters over the past 11 years.

Figure 7
The problems with the England et al. (2014) model-based assumptions are blatantly obvious. The ocean heat content of the tropical Pacific has cooled quite rapidly since 2001. And subsurface temperatures of the entire Pacific Ocean during the ARGO-era show little to no warming.
Those basic data-based realities contradict the climate-model-based assumptions of England et al. (2014)…and Matthew England’s guest post at RealClimate, and the NBC News article by John Roach.
REALCLIMATE POST
The body of the RealClimate post by Matthew England is a summary of the England et al. (2014) paper, and we outlined the failings of the paper above. Eric Steig wrote the introduction for the RealClimate blog post. For support, Eric linked a few papers:

Foster and Rahmstorf (2009) – We discussed the failings with Foster and Rahmstorf (2009) in the post here, and with the follow-up Rahmstorf et al. (2012) in the post here. And as you’ll recall, even SkepticalScience threw Foster and Rahmstorf (2009) under the bus.
Balmaseda et al. (2013) – Balmaseda et al. (2013) was a primary topic of discussion in the “Trenberth still searching for the missing heat” series of posts: here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here and here.
Cowtan and Way (2013) – We discussed how the Cowtan and Way (2013) infilling of HADCRUT4 global land+ocean surface temperature data did nothing to explain the hiatus over 90% of the globe–but exaggerated the model failings at the poles–in the posts here and here.

THE NBC NEWS ARTICLE ABOUT ENGLAND ET AL. (2014)
John Roach begins his article with (my boldface):
For the past 13 years, global surface air temperatures have hardly budged higher despite continual pumping of planet-warming gasses into the atmosphere from the engines of modern life. Does this prove global warming is a giant hoax? No, according to a new study, which says the missing heat is being blown into the western Pacific Ocean by extraordinarily powerful and accelerating trade winds.
The reference to “global surface air temperatures” is curious. I suspect John Roach relied on England et al. (2014) for it. The abstract of England et al. (2014) begins (my boldface):
Despite ongoing increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, the Earth’s global average surface air temperature has remained more or less steady since 2001.
And the first sentence of the paper reads (my boldface):
Observations of global average surface air temperature (SAT) show an unequivocal warming over the twentieth century1, however the overall trend has been interrupted by periods of weak warming or even cooling (Fig. 1).
Yet England et al. did not present “global surface air temperature” data in cell a of their Figure 1. See my Figure 8.

Figure 8 (cell a of Figure 1 from England et al.)
England et al. (2014) presented GISS Land-Ocean Temperature Index (LOTI) data in their Figure 1, which is a combination of land surface air temperature data and sea surface temperature data, with the vast majority being sea surface temperature data since the oceans cover 70% of the planet.
To confirm that, under the heading of Methods, England et al. write [my brackets]:
Observations and reanalysis data. SAT [surface air temperature] is taken from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) climatology.
And no, I’m not being pedantic. As we’ve shown in numerous posts over the past year, climate models do a reasonable job of simulating land surface air temperatures over the past 30+ years, but in order to achieve that warming, the climate models have to double the observed warming rate of the surface of the oceans. See Figure 9.

Figure 9
And using marine air temperature data do not help the models, either—see Figure 10—though it has to be kept in mind that the ICOADS marine air temperature data are not corrected for the shipboard “heat island effect” that plagues that dataset.

Figure 10
John Roach began his discussion of climate models with a catchy heading:
Model failure
The shortcomings of the climate models highlighted in this new paper feed into larger criticism that the models play down the importance of natural variability in the global climate system. “You want to have enough noise in your system” in order to get a realistic result, noted Xie.
That this shortfall is highlighted in the new research, he added, “is quite a nice result, but in a sense it is bad news for the climate research community because it does point to a potential problem for the climate models.”
It’s not a potential problem. It’s a major problem. One contributing factor to the problem is that climate scientists (example Shang-Ping Xie’s quote) view coupled ocean-atmosphere processes as “noise in your system”. ENSO is not noise; ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere process that climate models still cannot simulate. Sea surface temperature data and ocean heat content data indicate that ENSO acts as a chaotic, sunlight-fueled, coupled ocean-atmosphere, recharge-discharge oscillator—with El Niño events acting as the discharge mode, and with La Niña events acting as the recharge and redistribution mode. If this topic is new to you, refer to illustrated essay “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge” [42MB pdf] for an introduction.
Climate models failings with respect to ENSO—their failures to properly simulate of El Niño- and La Niña-related processes—have been known for years. See Guilyardi et al. (2009) and Bellenger et al (2012). It is very difficult to find a portion—any portion—of El Niño and La Niña processes that the models simulate properly.
Then John Roach allowed Matthew England and others some more leeway:
A problem with the models, in turn, could erode trust in climate science, noted England. But “that would be akin to writing off the medical profession for finding out something new about an illness that they didn’t know about earlier,” he said.
The inability of the models to capture the observed wind trends and thus the hiatus is “just one small process in the global system that seems to need improvement,” he noted. The long-term global warming trend, he added, is independent from decade-to-decade variability in the Pacific Ocean.
Fyfe echoed the sentiment. Instead of undermining climate science, he said, “What you are seeing here in this discussion is the natural evolution of science and improving our understanding. The overall big picture that the planet is warming and that that warming is due to human influence stills stands with or without the hiatus.”
For those who understand climate model failings, the trust in climate science has been eroding for years. In fact, for many persons, it has eroded to the point that we have no confidence in climate models…none at all.
This sentence is a classic: “The long-term global warming trend…is independent from decade-to-decade variability in the Pacific Ocean.” And the claim “just one small process in the global system that seems to need improvement” is the understatement of the year. Combined they form the most bizarre assertions I’ve seen attributed to a climate scientist to date…

…especially when the paper that England authored indicated the lack of global surface warming has been caused in part by the “decade-to-decade variability in the Pacific Ocean”. In other words, without that “decade-to-decade variability in the Pacific Ocean” there would not have been the hiatus. (His paper also failed to address the contribution to the long-term warming from the mid-1970s to the turn of the century caused by the domination of El Niño events during that period.)
…especially when England et al. (2014) presented multidecadal changes in surface temperatures in response to multidecadal “variability in the Pacific Ocean”, not “decade-to-decade variability”. (See their Figure 1, which is my Figure 8.)
…especially when one considers that the Pacific is the largest ocean on this planet, that it covers more of the surface of the planet than all of the land masses combined, and that its surface area dwarfs the area of the other ocean basins. See Figure 11.


Figure 11

…especially when one considers than the monthly, annual and decadal variations global sea surface temperatures mimic the variations in the Pacific sea surface temperatures…because the Pacific is so massive and because the dominant coupled ocean-atmosphere processes that express themselves as El Niño and La Niña events take place in the Pacific. See Figure 12.


Figure 12

…especially when one considers that the multidecadal variations in the sea surface temperatures of the global oceans mimic the variations in the Pacific…again because the Pacific is so massive and because the dominant coupled ocean-atmosphere processes that express themselves as El Niño and La Niña events take place in the Pacific. See Figure 13, which presents the two datasets detrended and smoothed with 121-month running-average filters.


Figure 13

…especially when one considers that the forced component of the climate models (represented by the multi-model mean) cannot simulate the multidecadal variations in the sea surface temperatures of the Pacific Ocean (Figure 14) or the global oceans (Figure 15), again represented by detrended and smoothed data and model outputs.


Figure 14
# # # # # #

Figure 15

…and, last but not least, especially when everyone understands that climate models were tuned to (and model projections extend from) a naturally occurring upswing in global sea surface temperatures, not the long-term trend. See Figure 16. (For the years used for model tuning, refer to Mauritsen, et al. (2012) Tuning the Climate of a Global Model [paywalled]. A preprint edition is here.)


Figure 16
Imagine how foolish the models would look if the modelers had tuned their models to the warming period from the early-1910s to the mid-1940s.
[Note: If you’re wondering why the climate models performed so poorly in Figures 14 and 15, refer to the post IPCC Still Delusional about Carbon Dioxide. The climate model simulations of sea surface temperatures do not capture the cooling that took place from 1880 to the early-1910s (see Figure 16 above) and, consequently, they do not capture the warming that took place from the early-1910s to the early-1940s.]
And once again, we find climate science being compared to medicine. But let’s put the climate model failings into perspective. The failures of the climate models to properly simulate coupled ocean-atmosphere processes are akin to doctors not being able to explain respiration and circulation. Climate models are in the dark ages compared to medicine.

"The global oil and gas industry has crashed. In mid-June, BP – formerly British Petroleum – slashed the value of its assets by US$17.5bn and revealed plans to cut its workforce by 15%. It forecast the price of oil would be a third lower than expected for decades to come and said it may be forced to leave new fossil fuel discoveries in the ground. It was later joined by Royal Dutch Shell, which announced its own US$22bn writedown, with its vast gas business – including major liquefied natural gas (LNG) developments in Australia – expected to take the heaviest toll.  Wood Mackenzie, a global energy research and consultancy group, says the fall in value is industry-wide, estimating US$1.6tn has been wiped from the sector this year, with more to come. While oil and gas are not alone in struggling in the face of biggest economic slump in nearly a century, WoodMac says its carnage cannot solely be blamed on Covid-19. The economic reality of the climate crisis is also starting to bite. “It’s about fundamental change hitting the entire oil and gas sector,” WoodMac’s vice-president for corporate analysis, Luke Parker, said. “Just a few years ago, few within the oil and gas industry would even countenance ideas of climate risk, peak demand, stranded assets, liquidation business models and so on. Today, companies are building strategies around these ideas.” If that reflects the global picture, the story among Australia’s oil and gas businesses – which until recently have been enjoying booming growth selling LNG to Asia, and driving most of the increase in national greenhouse gas emissions – is less clear. The idea of stranded assets due to climate change is not new. It suggests carbon-intensive projects potentially worth trillions risk becoming next-to worthless – stranded – if investors abandon them in favour of emissions-free technology, as required to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement. In Australia, the risk is recognised by the country’s major financial institutions and regulators, and has increasingly become a focus of shareholders. Earlier this year they gave resolutions calling for climate action and transparency at oil and gas companies Woodside Energy and Santos more than 50% and more than 40% support, respectively. Activist shareholders are not persuaded by suggestions support for gas is justified as it emits less than coal when burned, and point to studies suggesting it may release more emissions than previously thought. On coal, where the concept of climate risk is increasingly accepted, Australia’s second-largest superannuation fund, First State Super, last week announced it would divest from any company that earns more than 10% of revenue from thermal coal mining. It followed an earlier, similar statement by Hesta, and three of Australia’s four major banks promising to soon stop supporting thermal coal. But the possibility of major assets being stranded is only occasionally acknowledged across politics, media and the industry. The federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, responded to First State Super’s announcement by saying it was “mystifying” that a fund would deny its members a “solid and attractive investment opportunity” in coal based on “misguided ideology”. Australian oil and gas companies have been hurt by the shutdown, with decisions on more than $80bn of new LNG projects put on hold and Oil Search this month laying off a third of its workforce. But the local industry’s public position on what the future holds differs from its competitors in Europe. In response to questions about Shell and BP’s writedowns, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea), representing oil and gas producers, did not mention climate risk. Andrew McConville, Appea’s chief executive, said Covid-19 and the ongoing low oil price were having a “double-whammy effect” and that it would remain an “incredibly challenging time” for the sector even after the broader economy began to recover. But he said the industry was accustomed to cyclical commodity prices and would be “here for the long term”. “Energy demand, and oil demand with it, will recover as travel restrictions are eased and economic activity resumes over time,” McConville said. “The right regulatory and fiscal policy settings will help ensure that Australia remains a competitive destination for oil and gas investments into the future.” The Morrison government agrees, having backed the idea of a “gas-fired recovery” from coronavirus after a drop in domestic gas prices. Its National Covid-19 Coordination Commission, led by the former Fortescue Metals executive Nev Power, has focused on gas-related recommendations. Neither the government nor the commission has explained how lower gas prices would encourage increased private investment unless it is backed by substantial public support. Even if that were in the offing, analysts believe maintaining low prices would be a pipe dream given production costs in new Australian gas fields are recognised to be high. This, in part, is what is driving the push to install gas import terminals along the Australian east coast. While it may seem ridiculous to starting buying fossil fuels from overseas while the country mines huge amounts for export, experts believe it may be the cheapest gas option – if the Morrison government and industry are determined to back new gas infrastructure rather than accelerate a switch to cheaper renewable energy. Analysts and investor representatives say it is still unclear how much weight climate risk will be given in oil and gas investment decisions in Australia in the short-to-medium term. Zoe Whitton, the head of ESG research with the financial services multinational Citi, says Australia’s outlook is arguably different to some other oil and gas producers as it mostly extracts gas, not oil. It also mostly sells to north Asian countries, where investment patterns are less clear and have been interpreted as backing both fossil fuels and renewable energy. It means that compared to Europe, views on gas still range from it being seen as a legitimate transition fuel to any support for it being clearly at odds with where the rest of the world is pulling. Whitton says investors are increasingly, but not uniformly, in the latter camp. “The local [companies] face the same pressure that the internationals do,” she says. “There is a process of negotiation going on between companies and investors, but I don’t expect the locals will respond to the global signal in a uniform way or a rapid way.” Whitton believes the future of the local gas industry may be clearer once world-leading models published recently by more than 60 central banks, under the banner of the Network for Greening the Financial System, give a local, rather than just a global, picture. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has begun the job of producing that data. It could, for example, give investors a better picture of whether Santos’s controversial $3.6bn Narrabri coal-seam gas proposal has a viable future. “The truth is gas may be a transition fuel for some regions, but not at any price and not forever,” Whitton says. “So the question is at what price, and for how long?” Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, representing institutional investors with funds worth about $2tn, says there is clear evidence an industry-wide structural change is under way. “Covid is to some extent attaching a rocket to a trend we were seeing anyway,” she says. She says Australia is part of that trend, but agrees with Whitton that it is a slightly different conversation than in some parts of the world. “Australia is saying its gas will continue to be competitive and its markets will hold up as others go down. The big question is: is that true?” Herd says if there is any analysis to support the idea that the local gas industry will thrive while others crash it has not been publicly released. The lack of information is driving calls for fossil fuel companies to release data on their “scope 3 emissions” – in basic terms, the carbon pollution that results from the fossil fuels a company sells. Herd says including information on scope 3 emissions in financial reporting is vital for investors to understand financial risk in a world that has pledged to cut emissions, and driving the push at recent annual general meetings for greater disclosure. “The obvious question is if Shell and BP can do it, why can’t Australian companies to the same extent?” she says. “What we need to see for our gas companies is reporting at the asset [project] level, not just at the company level. We need the data to assess risk. That could change the viability of some of their projects.” Australia’s oil and gas companies did not engage on the question of climate risk. Santos declined to comment while spokespeople for Woodside and Origin Energy said the companies periodically reviewed their portfolio of assets. Origin said several factors contributed to the valuation “including commodity prices, interest rates, exchange rates and costs”. Whitton suggests big investors, who may ultimately drive change faster than governments, have additional criteria. “A lot of investors are saying ‘look, if I have 10 futures and if in five of those futures gas is an answer and in five it is not, but renewable energy is an answer in all 10, then you can see where the greater risk lies,” she says. “The reality is when you have a really wide range of future scenarios the risk of stranded assets is higher. And the risk of stranded assets is higher in Australia just by dint of the higher likelihood that people will take a bet on oil and gas compared to the EU, where they won’t.”"

The Republic of Korea is one of the world’s great success stories. The war‐​torn former Japanese colony has become a high‐​tech industrialized nation with one of the world’s largest economies. Years of military dictatorship have given way to robust democracy.



But sixty‐​one years after the end of the Korean War, the ROK still refuses to defend itself. In fact, its officials appear determined to preserve America’s outdated security guarantee by keeping their nation militarily helpless and dependent.



South Korea’s ambitions are similar to those of any other major power. Its businesses operate around the globe. Its people go abroad as missionaries and tourists. Its diplomats participate in foreign forums. Its military contributes to international peacekeeping operations. And its government is creating armed forces capable of acting overseas, including a “blue water” navy for deployment well beyond the ROK’s own waters. The Park government is even considering constructing two light aircraft carriers in the coming decades.



Yet Seoul doesn’t exercise operational control over its own military in wartime. That authority remains with the United States as it has since the Korean War.



American control originally made sense, since the ROK’s authoritarian government was both feckless and reckless. But economic prosperity arrived in the 1960s. Democracy finally came a quarter century later.





Sixty‐​one years after the end of the Korean War, the ROK still refuses to defend itself.



Today, the South enjoys vast advantages over its decrepit antagonist to the north: forty times the economic strength, twice the population, a vast technological lead, easy access to international markets and almost unanimous diplomatic support. The so‐​called Democratic People’s Republic of Korea can’t even count on its traditional ally, China, in a military showdown on the peninsula.



However, the ROK insists that it is incapable of defending itself against the North, which has suffered through mass malnutrition and starvation, agricultural disaster, industrial collapse and international isolation. The Park government complains that the South Korean army lacks adequate command and control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities—six decades after the last war; after turning into an economic powerhouse; while considering the construction of aircraft carriers.



South Koreans once were embarrassed that operational control (OPCON) was lodged with the U.S.  _Peacetime_ operational control and was returned to the ROK only in 1994. The United States was happy to shift responsibility, having been blamed for the depredations of the last military dictatorship because some South Koreans wrongly assumed Washington could have prevented brutal repression as in the city of Kwangju.



The South Korean government raised the issue of wartime control in 2003. The United States again was open, initially proposing to transfer control in 2009. But ROK hawks mobilized against the leftish South Korean government, slowing the process. In 2007, the two countries agreed to turn OPCON over to the ROK in 2012. But after a North Korean nuclear test and other provocations, ROK defense minister Kim Tae‐​young, representing a more conservative government, complained that the planned date would be “the worst time” to do so. In June 2010, the two governments kicked the shift back to December 2015.



Last year, the South cited North Korea’s latest nuclear test, which, said Defense Minister Kim Kwan‐​jin, made it “inappropriate to change the command structure as scheduled.” He pointed to other “situations” as well, arguing that “North Korea is different from the past.” At the April summit between President Barack Obama and President Park Geun‐​hye, the two governments agreed to reconsider the timing. The latest round of bilateral discussions occurred just last month.



Analysts expect the transfer to be bumped back another five to seven years at the annual U.S.-ROK Security Consultative Meetings scheduled for October. Of course, past experience suggests that as 2020 approaches, Seoul will request another postponement. The South appears to be committed to permanent dependence.



In fact, South Korea’s helplessness is a result of its own decisions. To take over OPCON the ROK needs more advanced weapons and an increased ability to use them. However, Seoul should obtain those capabilities irrespective of OPCON to defend itself. If it hasn’t acquired them over the last sixty‐​one years, what has the ROK armed forces been doing? What is wrong with Seoul?



Indeed, observed Larry Niksch, formerly of the Congressional Research Service: “since the [Combined Forces Command] was formed in the late 1970s, U.S. and South Korean military personnel have worked side-by-side—physically side-by-side—in all of the operations of the command. It is difficult to believe that the South Korean command has not achieved a high level of preparedness over this 30‐​year period.”



It seems obvious that Seoul has little incentive to take on greater defense responsibilities. Obviously, South Koreans benefit from Washington’s defense commitment. U.S. subsidies allow the South to underinvest in defense while undertaking prestige programs, such as aircraft carriers, which do little to protect against the main security threat—a North Korean attack.



Nevertheless, Seoul pays a price for its dependence. Fearing Nixon administration plans to reduce overseas military commitments, Park Chung-hee’s government sent troops to Vietnam on America’s behalf, resulting in more than 5000 deaths. In recent years, the ROK has similarly backed U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, though at a far lower cost.



The South’s dependence on America also allows Washington to interfere with ROK defense plans. In 1993 and 1994, for instance, the Clinton administration considered military action against the North with little concern for the South’s interests. In the 2000s, Washington objected to South Korea’s “Sunshine Policy” of subsidy and accommodation with the North. Since North Korean military attacks in 2010 inflamed South Korea’s willingness to retaliate, the United States has played the pacifist, warning the ROK against precipitous action in response to DPRK provocations.



Although older South Koreans generally viewed the loss of sovereignty as a necessary price to pay for U.S. protection, younger South Koreans are more nationalistic and thus more likely to treat the current relationship as an affront to South Korean dignity and pride.



OPCON’s larger ramifications are a matter of debate. For instance, it is widely believed that the ROK has to make a greater military effort to take over operational control. Doing so would yield increased military flexibility and reduced restraint in responding to North Korean provocations. That should enhance South Korean deterrence.



At the same time, there is widespread fear, mostly among South Koreans, that transferring OPCON would encourage America to “abandon” the ROK. But retired U.S. Gen. Ronald Griffith shared the concern: “the first step to withdraw U.S. forces is turn over the command. That’s step number one, and it’s a slippery slope.”



Of course, the United States has permanent military deployments in Japan and across Europe without exercising operational control of host nations’ militaries. Moreover, the very concept of abandonment is odd. Washington has defended the South for sixty‐​four years. Given the dramatic change in the regional‐​threat environment, withdrawing American forces would be a natural act of good sense.



Indeed, OPCON merely is the symptom, since it grows out of the 1953 defense treaty, mutual in name only. A bizarre insistence that commitments cannot change with circumstances similarly afflicts the planned redeployment south of U.S. forces. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of the U.S. Forces Korea,advocates retaining a troop tripwire north of Seoul to ensure automatic American involvement in any conflict: “there may be a need operationally to leave some residual in those areas just for proper defense and response.” He called the ROK the Pentagon’s second highest priority, after only Afghanistan.



But why? The ROK mattered in 1950 not because of its intrinsic importance, but because it was part of a larger hegemonic struggle with the Soviet Union. That world is gone.



Washington gets little out of the alliance today. Certainly nothing from protecting the ROK, which is able to defend itself. Some policy makers view U.S. troops stationed there as “dual use,” ready to confront China as well as North Korea. However, Seoul has no interest in turning its permanent neighbor, the PRC, into a permanent enemy to advance U.S. interests elsewhere in the region.



Some Americans, such as Army Lt. Col. James Minnich, argue for broader ties, a “comprehensive, strategic alliance” reaching human trafficking, peacekeeping and climate change. Yet collaboration in none of these areas requires a formal military alliance. Using support for green‐​energy research as an excuse to maintain a military tripwire along the DMZ is, frankly, bizarre.



It is time to transfer operational command of South Korea’s military back to Seoul. But the change should not stop there. America’s troops should go home, phased out over the next couple of years. More important, the defense treaty should be terminated, transforming the alliance from a relationship of dependence into one of cooperation.



South Korea has much of which to be proud. Despite a hard beginning, the ROK has become one of the world’s most successful and important nations; at least in every major area except defense, since it remains a welfare client of America. Alliances shouldn’t be forever, irrespective of changing geopolitical circumstances. It is long past time for a change.

"Dry tropical forests are more vulnerable to the impacts of global heating than had been thought, according to new research, with wildlife and plants at severe risk of harm from human impacts. Some tropical forests are very wet, but others thrive in a drier climate and scientists had thought these drier forests would be better adapted to drought, and therefore more able to cope with the effects of the climate crisis.  But a new study suggests the opposite may be true, and forests with an already drier climate show greater loss of biodiversity, and a reduced ability to support a wide variety of wildlife and plant species, when subjected to warmer temperatures. Wetter forests, with year-round rainfall, show less change in biodiversity. The researchers examined both wet and dry tropical forests in West Africa. Dry forests appear to be already on the verge of a tipping point, whereby further years of hot and dry conditions could cause a rapid transformation. Wetter forests may be better able to withstand prolonged hotter and drier spells because of the greater reserves of moisture in their tree trunks and soils, but scientists do not know how long they may stay resilient. The findings should aid conservation efforts aimed at protecting the world’s remaining heavily forested areas, according to Jesus Aguirre-Gutierrez, researcher at the University of Oxford, and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications. Deforestation is growing rapidly in Africa, putting more of the world’s vital carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots under threat. “Drier forests are becoming more homogeneous, in their function and composition, and that may mean forests are going to be less able to carry out their functions and they will not have so many species,” he told the Guardian. “This is going to effect the services they provide for people, especially as these communities are among the poorest people in the world. It has an escalating effect.” The study joins an increasing body of research suggesting that the world’s forests, which play a vital role in regulating the earth’s climate, as well as fostering a huge variety of wildlife and plant populations, are under increasing threat. Other recent studies have found that many of the world’s forests are becoming so degraded by human activities, and damaged by worsening climate change, that they could cease acting as carbon sinks. While wetter rainforests better fit most people’s conception of what tropical forests are like, drier forests are also home to a wide range of plants and wildlife. For instance, among the species found in the drier forests studied for the Nature paper are the afina tree (Strombosia pustulata), which yields a hard wood that is resistant to termites, and the limba (Terminalia superba), which is used to treat wounds and malaria in traditional African medicine, and which was also used in the 1950s to make Gibson guitars. The Oxford researchers, along with more than 30 students and academics from Ghana, collected data on 299 trees from 94 species over six months from West African forests."
"**US telecoms operator Verizon has become the latest major company to pull advertising from Facebook platforms.**
The company joins Ben and Jerry's and a growing list of firms boycotting the social media giant over its handling of controversial posts.
Verizon is believed to be the biggest advertiser so far to back the Stop Hate for Profit campaign.
Other than its namesake platform, Facebook's social media brands also include Instagram and WhatsApp.
""Our brand safety standards have not changed. We're pausing our advertising until Facebook can create an acceptable solution that makes us comfortable and is consistent with what we've done with YouTube and other partners,"" a Verizon spokesperson told the BBC.
In response to Verizon's announcement, Carolyn Everson, vice president for Facebook's Global Business Group, said: ""We respect any brand's decision, and remain focused on the important work of removing hate speech and providing critical voting information. Our conversations with marketers and civil rights organizations are about how, together, we can be a force for good.""
Last year the social network attracted advertising revenue of almost $70bn (Â£56bn).
Earlier this week, ice cream maker Ben and Jerry's and outdoor brands The North Face, Patagonia and REI were amongst the companies to back Stop Hate for Profit.
Ben and Jerry's said it is standing with the campaign and ""all those calling for Facebook to take stronger action to stop its platforms from being used to divide our nation, suppress voters, foment and fan the flames of racism and violence, and undermine our democracy"".
The death of an African-American man George Floyd in police custody has led to major protests around the world over the way police treat black people and highlighted racism and inequality in societies.
George Floyd died in Minneapolis in May as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The final moments were filmed on phones. Four police officers involved have been sacked and charged over his death.
The Stop Hate for Profit campaign was launched last week by advocacy groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Color Of Change.
The movement has said it is a ""response to Facebook's long history of allowing racist, violent and verifiably false content to run rampant on its platform"".
Stop Hate for Profit has called on advertisers to pressure the company to adopt stricter measures against racist and hateful content on its platforms by stopping all spending on advertising with it throughout July.
A European Commission report this month found Facebook removed 86% of hate speech last year, up from 82.6%.
The social network, says almost all of the content which violates its policies is automatically detected by its systems and removed before it is reported."

As we have alluded to several times recently at _The BFD_ , there are markedly different approaches to environmental issues which seem notably dependent on one’s political philosophy. For instance, the [Klimate Kult](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/just-what-will-the-krazy-klimate-kults-demands-really-cost/) is fixated on narcissistic public protest almost entirely dissociated from empirical reality, while offering no solutions other than vague, warmed-over Marxist revolutionary rhetoric. Jacinda Ardern grandstands at the UN, while [deceitfully pulling a political swifty](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/ardern-the-ultimate-climate-hypocrite/) which guarantees that New Zealand’s emissions will grow, unabated. E-NGOs like Greenpeace react to an at least real problem – ocean plastic waste – with authoritarian demands that completely fail to address the actual culprits.



On the other hand, the United States is derided for refusing to sign up for, or abandoning, the plethora of globalist “agreements” and “protocols” from Kyoto to Paris. Yet, the US’ emissions have fallen dramatically. The Morrison government is [committed to finding technological and economic solutions](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/morrison-aims-to-actually-fix-the-environment-instead-of-screeching-about-climate-change/), especially to pressing environmental issues such as plastic.



Even in Australia, while the Morrison government is spruiking potentially revolutionary, commercially viable, recycling technologies, the Victorian government is proposing a nightmare, Orwellian system of overbearing bureaucracy and inefficiency.



A five-coloured rainbow of daily rubbish duties for the householder; constant sorting in the basement; living under the threat of having your garbage left behind because you failed to follow the rules; being bossed about by a council worker in hi-vis rejecting your rubbish; rules that your garbage must be in transparent plastic to allow inspection, or costly biodegradable bags for organic waste; and colour coding that is an immutable law unto itself.



In addition to daily duties for household waste there are the supplementary collection days for old clothing and large items and garden waste that can take months to organise.



What the writer is describing above is the ghastly regime imposed on households by some Italian councils. It’s a nightmare of Byzantine complexity that creates endless headaches for households, spiralling costs and only leads to **more** garbage. Naturally, the socialist Andrews government is enamoured of the idea.



Last Monday’s report from Infrastructure Victoria that sees a future for Melburnians separating materials into organics, plastics, paper and cardboard, glass, metals and “regular” waste is part of a global shift to recycling and sorting by the householder to make the rubbish handlers’ job easier.



Which is exactly the system they have introduced in Italy.



Five separate rubbish bins; every household must put out or bring in a rubbish bin every day of the week and spend every evening sorting the rubbish to avoid contamination that would see collectors leave it behind.



There are five categories of rubbish, each with their own colour-coded bin, which must have its own designated bin-liner of a specified type […] of course, all bins can’t be collected on the same day. Each is collected on a set day of the week.



But because organic waste has to be collected more often, the collection days shift and you must keep a daily calendar. No bin is collected on Sunday but you need to put one out Sunday night.



[…] my neighbours […] had their rubbish rejected three days in a row because they used black plastic bags.



[…] The cumulative result of rejected rubbish, a lack of public bins, confusion over categories and a reluctance to store putrid rubbish is that sneaky piles of trash appear around the place, and in the rural areas woodstoves and fires have the distinct smell of burning plastic.



Sounds like exactly the kind of results-driven efficiency governments are renowned for.



We just need more of it, **then** everything will be perfect.

Apparently a WordPress version update “had faultily written the htaccess file“, the host company has just informed me. Don’t ask me what that is supposed to mean.  At any rate, the problem seems to be resolved, and we’re well back in the “denial” business. 🙂
I’m short on time today and so this post will be a short one.
Awhile back I wrote a piece here about global sea ice. When one examines the chart objectively, one finds no sign of any global warming – assuming that it is an indication of global temperature as the warmists like to tell us (especially when sea ice shrinks).

Global sea ice shows no sign of any global warming. Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/dpuf.
Again we note that sea ice has been normal for over 2 years now. Antarctica has been constantly above normal for a long period of 3 years – something that is unprecedented and a record since satellite measurements began.
And when one really looks honestly and objectively at the above chart above, we see that global sea ice has been markedly below normal only about 4 of 36 years: half of 2006, 2007, half of 2010, 2011 and half of 2012. That’s 3.5 years – but we can round it up to four whole years out of 36.
One could argue 2002 should be included, but the amount is not significantly below normal. In 2008 there was only a sharp but brief dip.  The last 4 years have seen a strong upward trend. Four years of course is too short to draw any conclusions (except when the ice melts).
The bottom line: Global sea ice shows no signs of a globe that is experiencing galloping warming.

Share this...FacebookTwitterWhat follows is photo-shopping taken to an extreme.
It’s little wonder few people believe anything the mainstream dailies write when it comes to climate change. Time and again they’ve been exposed to be unloading barges of BS onto their readers.
Reader Jim sent an e-mail bringing attention to probably the most amateur photo-shopping work on behalf of global warming propaganda I’ve seen in a long time, all used by eco-journalist Peter Hannam of the Sydney Morning Herald in a piece about the coal-fired Liddel Power Station in Hunter Valley, NSW.
Not only is the photo totally manipulated with the aim of deceiving readers, but Hannam’s facts are just as misleading as the photo-shopped power plant image itself:

Glaring photo-shopped image by Jonathan Carroll gets used by the SMH to produce impression that the Liddel coal power plant is causing disease at an epidemic proportion. Original photo: Jonathan Carroll. 
Note how the steam emitted by the power plant’s cooling towers is a sinister black. Since when is water vapor black? Hannam obviously is unable to distinguish between the smoke stack and the cooling towers. The scant emissions from the single smokestack in the center of the image shows just how clean coal power plants have become.
The photo also tells the many readers residing in the northern hemisphere that skies down under have very weird colors.
Hannam reports on an activist group of doctors who using a dubious formula claim they have succeeded in putting a figure on the health damage the power plant causes: $600 million annually.

The Coal and Health in the Hunter report by the Climate and Health Alliance estimates that burning coal for electricity in the valley alone produces health damage in the order of $600 million annually from the resulting air pollution, including the release of small particles.”
However, as reader Jim points out, a quick search of health statistics from Hunter New England Health (which covers the Hunter Valley) shows that Hannam’s claims are dubious at best. What follows is a chart showing the causes of death for all respiratory ailments:

Source: Health Statistics New South Wales
The above chart shows that deaths due to respiratory ailments are primarily caused by lung cancer (smoking) and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) which is in part related to pollution. Deaths from COPD, which to some extent are linked to the emissions from coal power plants, have been declining over the last 15 years.
Deaths due to asthma, a disease that could certainly be exacerbated by pollution, shows no trend.
Why would any reader believe anything Hannam writes? Using doctored images and dubious statistical methods, he is obviously attempting to fabricate a health crisis that does not exist.

If there’s one thing that’s obvious about the globalist left-elite, it’s that they never deign to live in the world of their own making. The plutocrats of Silicon Valley and Washington secure themselves in walled compounds far from the stench of human filth that’s overwhelming cities like San Francisco. The wealthiest residents of Wentworth vote for “climate action”, but make sure that no wind turbines sully their harbour views.



But Open Borders is the starkest example of elitist NIMBY hypocrisy. The Greens, the richest voter bloc in Australia, campaign to bring illegal immigrants to our shores – while being careful to ship them all out to the poor Western suburbs.



The arrogant isolation of the left-elite in Wentworth is writ large in Europe, where poor southern nations are being forced to carry the burden of decisions made in Brussels, at the behest of Germany.



What has become Europe’s “toilet” is now officially full. That’s how an African boy put it to me last summer­: “Athens is a toilet, and we are living in it.”



It’s got so bad, even the turds themselves are noticing that the bog is overflowing.



The Dublin Regulation, for example — catastrophic for Greece — was a farsighted policy by Brussels. It ensured people claiming refugee status had to be processed in their first port of call. Greece was a convenient solution. In 2015, one million refugees poured into the country, trudging through the Balkans to reach Germany, the northernmost Europea­n states and Britain.



“Farsighted” is one way to put it. “Cynically self-serving” might be more accurate.



German chancellor Angela Merkel almost single-handedly created Europe’s illegal immigrant disaster, when she declared the gates of Europe open to all comers. In a panic at the tens of millions who flooded Europe’s Mediterranean shores and swept north to the welfare states, the EU desperately sought a way to spare the elite in Brussels from the disaster they had created.



Meanwhile, Greece’s coastlines and its islands — its most important export — were suddenly­ covered in bodies, orange­ life jackets, shoes and nappies […] No refugee wants to remain in Greece, a poor country with an ailing economy and a weak welfare­ system. They want to go to Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland, France, Britain.



Of course they do. That’s because they’re not “refugees”: they’re illegal economic migrants with no intention of working for a living if they can sponge off German and British taxpayers.



But then, the Trump Derangement Syndrome sets in.



The US also has much to answer­ for. Most administrations since WWII have sought to inveigle their way into international disputes in the name of American interests that we have been convinced are humanity’s interests. This has been the case particularly in the Middle East, something recently confirmed by […] US President Donald Trump’s blunder.



What is this clown talking about? It’s as if there’s no blame to be borne by Bush, Obama, or the Clintons, let alone globalists such as the UN, whose meddling led directly to Libya becoming a failed state. On the other hand, Trump is committed to **ending** the US’s constant “inveigl[ing] their way into international disputes in the name of American interests”.



In the coming months, we may see thousands of newly displaced people heading for Europe yet again. This time the insulated northern European states will not be able to ignore reality. Those in Vienna, Bern and Stockholm may finally get a taste of what it feels like to live in Athens, because their southern European “toilet” is already full.



You’d think the Greeks would have learned by now. Greece was humiliated by Brussels and especially by Berlin during the economic and political crises of 2008-2012. Instead of being left to deal with the harsh realities of their own financial vagabondry, Greeks were forced to endure a humiliating regime of German paternalism and authoritarianism.



Rather than shaking their fists at America, Greeks and other southern European nations would be better off learning from the people of Britain and Australia: tell the EU to get lost and demand that the government get serious and start shipping grifting illegal immigrants right back where they came from. **Time for Grexit.**

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve always found the discussion over consensus in science extremely annoying. History is clear: When it comes to science progress, consensus has ended up being the loser every single time. 
=======================
The ninety seven percent problem: which consensus?
By Uli Weber
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
We constantly hear and read about the claim that 97 percent of all scientific papers (or sometimes all scientists) confirm man-made global warming. The Consensus Project made such a statement in a scientific paper which precisely wants to prove the point. The paper titled: “Quantifying the consensus on anthropogenic global warming in the scientific literature” by Cook et al. in the Environ. Res. Lett. 8 (2013) 024024 (7pp) points to the 97% consensus for anthropogenic global warming (AGW) as follows:

12,465 scientific papers examined for statements on AGW
4014 papers contain own statement on AGW
Of these 4014 papers with statements on AGW, 97% confirm the AGW theory.

The supposed 97 percent AGW consensus is calculated using only a part that is 4014 of the originally surveyed 12,465 scientific papers, and not on the totality of the examined papers. The calculation approach of course is totally absurd and virtually meaningless. If one could even present such a statement on AGW in such a way to begin with, then the so called “consensus“ using the correct method of calculation would yield a result of only 32% of the surveyed scientific papers. Yet at the same time the approximately one third of the 12,465 surveyed papers are supposed to represent the entire spectrum of proponents of the AGW theory as well as the so-called luke-warmers who believe that a human contribution to climate is possible, but reject the catastrophe scenarios for the future climate.
Thus for the forecast of global future climate catastrophe scenarios, what is really left is only a consensus of considerably under one third of the papers surveyed and not more. And when one looks more critically at the information, one indeed does find there is a stated restriction to the described partial amount of papers in the Consensus Project. Here it is written in fine print behind the huge “97%” (emphasis added),

… of published climate papers with a position on human-caused global warming agree: GLOBAL WARMING IS HAPPENING – AND WE ARE THE CAUSE”,
However, in a thorough consideration of all the scientific climate publications surveyed by Cook et al., the result looks entirely different:

A two thirds majority of the examined scientific climate papers take no socio-political stand on AGW.
Judging from socio-political views, only about 1% of climate realists are said to be opposed to AGW.
The AGW protagonists on the other hand, with about one third of all the surveyed publications, are far less reserved when it comes to their statements on scientific publications.

Result:
The ominous and often cited 97% consensus for the acceptance of the AGW theory in climate science does not exist. Thus the scientifically hostile demand for “an end to the climate discussion” is morally and computationally way offsides. In the Cook et al. study it is clearly shown that the protagonists of the climate catastrophe bring their social-political positions in scientific papers. Finally, in the given study a comparison is made between diametrically opposed socio-political positions using a subjectively selected sampling amount as a yardstick for a supposed consensus in the entire climate sciences.
The one positive result the study yields is that it allows us to determine that in climate science there is still a “silent” two thirds majority who choose to refrain from the socio-political discussion in their scientific publications. In the end, however, in the public depiction of climate science, the socio-political opinion of a one third minority is being sold as scientific 97% majority consensus.
So with the backdrop of the proven “one-third truth“ for man-made climate change, it is indeed very peculiar that the so-called “climate deniers” are getting lumped together with deniers of every type by the climate catastrophe followers again and again. Moreover in an open scientific discussion on the fundamentals of the dreaded climate change, it is completely incomprehensible that a climate of hatred is being applied to an equal extent against both the “climate deniers” and “luke-warmers” (Kalte-Sonne article of 3 February 2015). And that is not only the case in Great Britain and in USA, but elsewhere as well. For example in a 2013 brochure issued by the German Ministry of Environment (to which a link no longer exists), climate change critics were universally declared as being clueless. German daily WELT even carried an article titled: “A government authority declares the climate debate over“.

"It took me much longer than it should have to realise that educating people about climate change science was not enough. Due perhaps to my personality type (highly rational, don’t talk to me about horoscopes, please) and my background (the well-educated daughter of a high school teacher and an academic), I have grown up accepting the idea that facts persuade and emotions detract from a good argument. Then again, I’m a social scientist. I study people. I deal mostly in feelings, not facts. A joke I like to tell about myself during speeches is that I’m an expert in the opinions of people who don’t know what they’re talking about. Over the 15 years I’ve been a social researcher, I’ve watched with concern the increasing effects of climate change, and also watched as significant chunks of the electorate voted for political parties with terrible climate change policies.  There is clearly a disconnect between what people say they are worried about and want action on and who, when given the chance, they pick to lead their country. The science behind climate change has been proven correct to the highest degree of certainty the scientific method allows. But climate change is more than just the science. It’s a social phenomenon. And the social dimensions of climate change can make the science look simple – the laws of physics are orderly and neat but people are messy. When social researchers like me try to analyse how a person responds to climate change messages the way they do, we’re measuring much, much more than just their comprehension (or not) of the climate science. We’re analysing the way they see the world, their politics, values, cultural identity, even their gender identity. It wouldn’t be a stretch to say we’re measuring their psyche, their innermost self. In his book Why We Disagree About Climate Change, the British professor Mike Hulme argues that this is one of the reasons we argue so much about the issue. “The sources of our disagreement with climate change lie deep within us, in our values and in our sense of identity and purpose,” he writes. “They do not reside ‘out there’, a result of our inability to grasp knowingly some ultimate physical reality.” It follows that to help resolve, even to some degree, the conflict and disagreement about climate change in the community, we need to understand those different belief systems and the emotional responses and social forces that shape them. And take them into account when we communicate about climate change and what should be done. This is even more important given how politicised climate change has become, especially in countries like the US and Australia. US research from has shown that reactions to climate change as a topic were becoming increasingly polarised along partisan lines around the late 1990s. He argues that the climate change views of Democrats and Republicans were not significantly different until the Kyoto protocol negotiations of 1997, when policymakers started to explore possible solutions to global warming. In an article for the academic journal Risk Analysis, the head of Yale’s program on climate change communications, Tony Leiserowitz, showed that in 2003, when respondents were asked in surveys for their first reaction to the phrase “global warming”, only 7% reacted with words like “hoax” or “scam”. By 2010 that had risen to 23%. There was a parallel trend in the UK: between 2003 and 2008, the belief that claims about climate change had been exaggerated almost doubled from 15% to 29%. The huge success and positive impact of Al Gore’s first documentary, 2006’s An Inconvenient Truth, had the less-than-positive side-effect of strongly associating the issue with the progressive side of politics. Today, as Leiserowitz comments, climate change scepticism and even denial in the US have become part of a cluster of beliefs (along with anti-abortion and anti-immigration) that are obvious markers of Republican allegiance. In my own social research with Australian voters, I see this politicisation all the time. Nowadays, I don’t even have to ask how someone voted in the last election to hazard a guess about their views on climate change. Sometimes all it takes is for me to ask them how they feel about the role of government (Are you taxed too much? Do you feel there is too much regulation?) and what media they trust the most (blogs and social media or public broadcasters?). The degree of polarisation in places like Australia and the US is not universal. The esteemed Pew Research Center found in 2015 that in “Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, followers of conservative parties are much less likely than followers of liberal or green parties to believe they will be harmed by climate change”. But in many other countries there are much less pronounced political differences, and much less public and political interest in contesting the science. For environmental activists in these less-polarised countries – often countries already feeling serious impacts from climate change but emitting negligible amounts of CO2 –the endless debate about the truth of the climate science in the big western countries is gobsmacking. Activists have expressed their frustration and disbelief, and it’s contributed not a little to their despair about progress at an international level. So when it comes to talking to people about climate change, it helps enormously to think about it not just as a scientific question but as a social and political one. But understanding how people’s already existing (and often entrenched) political allegiances influence their response to climate change is only part of the picture. Understanding their emotional reactions is even more important, and that leads us from politics towards psychology. Viewing the climate change issue through a psychological lens yields endless important insights into why we are where we are. Have a look at the must-watch 2018 Ted Talk by the meteorologist J Marshall Shepherd, on three kinds of bias that shape your worldview. As a self-proclaimed weather geek, he often gets asked if he believes in climate change. He finds the question odd because science isn’t about belief. It’s about proof that things are real or not. He is agog at the chasm between what scientists know to be true and what surveys have shown the US public believes about issues like vaccinations, evolution and, of course, climate change. This has led the natural scientist to start thinking about psychology, namely what biases shape our perceptions of the world around us. He picks three big ones. The first, and probably the most obvious, is confirmation bias, namely that we zero in on evidence that supports what we already believe. Confirmation bias is even more pronounced in a world where we can use our social media to filter out information we don’t want to absorb and where we follow influencers who reinforce our existing beliefs. The second bias is called Dunning-Kruger, which describes our human tendency to think we know more than we do as well as to underestimate what we don’t know. Again, I see this happen in focus groups all the time, when participants with no scientific credentials or training pick apart the science of climate change. The third and final bias is cognitive dissonance. When people encounter actions or ideas they cannot reconcile psychologically with their own beliefs, they experience discomfort. They then try to resolve their discomfort by arguing away the new evidence. Given that climate change is such a discomforting topic, I see this cognitive dissonance all the time in focus groups, where people try to find reasons other than climate change for the events happening around them, even when faced with a strong scientific explanation. They pick it apart because of Dunning-Kruger and then, because of confirmation bias, try to find a blog that states something other than what the scientific evidence shows. J Marshall Shepherd argues that we need to close the gap between public perception and scientific fact, to create a better future and preserve life as we know it. He challenges us to take an inventory of our biases and of the beliefs we use to prop them up. Think about where you get your information, how reliable it is and whether you only read the things that agree with what you want to think rather than the actual truth. Then share what you’ve learned – about yourself and about the world – with other people. I’m not saying facts don’t matter or the scientific method should be watered down or we should communicate without facts. What I am saying is that now the climate science has been proven to be true to the highest degree possible, we have to stop being reasonable and start being emotional.  More science isn’t the solution. People are the solution. • This is an edited extract from How to Talk About Climate Change in a Way That Makes a Difference, by Rebecca Huntley (Murdoch Books, $32.99)"

Press Release: **Labour Party**



This week [ Oct 25th], we’re taking action on climate change, expanding trades education – and celebrating two years of progress!



Here’s what we’ve been busy with this week:



We have a plan to put New Zealand on a path to a zero-carbon future.



This week, we took the next step, joining forces with farming leaders to **announce a plan** to measure and price emissions at the farm level **by 2025.**



We’re tackling the long-term challenge of climate change by making sure 100% of New Zealand’s emissions will be on the path downwards. For too long, politicians have passed the buck and caused uncertainty for everyone, while the need for climate action was clear. This plan provides the primary sector with certainty and puts us shoulder-to-shoulder on a path to reduce emissions.



Want to know more? Here’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Climate Change Minister James Shaw discussing the plan.



We’re committed to reversing the long-term decline in trades training. This week, we announced we’re expanding two secondary school initiatives to help more young New Zealanders take up a trade, helping close the skills gap.



We’ll be funding 2,000 more Trades Academy places from next year and up to 2,000 more places for the Gateway programme. We want schools better linked to the world of work, and for students in school to have clearer and more direct pathways into vocational education in the workplace and the tertiary system.



We also announced we’re supporting a further 140 Ministry of Education careers events that connect schools, employers and communities, and are establishing a contestable fund to support schools to run their own trade events.



We know that investing in research and innovation is the main route to a more productive, sustainable and inclusive economy.



We’re putting New Zealand at the forefront of emerging data science technologies, by investing in four new projects that make good use of unique New Zealand data sets. The four projects range from teaching Siri to speak te Reo M?ori to crunching large data sets collected via satellites. [Read more here](https://www.mbie.govt.nz/science-and-technology/science-and-innovation/funding-information-and-opportunities/investment-funds/strategic-science-investment-fund/)



This week marks two years since we came into Government – and although the long-term challenges facing New Zealand won’t be solved overnight, we’re proud of all we’ve achieved so far.



From building more than 2,300 state houses to funding more cancer treatment equipment and drugs, we’re making progress on the issues that matter to New Zealand. [Check out everything we’ve done here](https://www.labour.org.nz/progress-2yrs-2019)

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis week’s hard copy of Spiegel features the front cover story dubbed “Der verheizte Planet” – The heated planet – (see right image below). Thus, Spiegel is returning and keeping to its long tradition of promoting end-of world scenarios.
The following image sequence shows how the burning planet is just the latest and newest climate catastrophe designed to get an apocalypse-weary public to worry (and to buy its magazines). So far the reaction, however, has been a big yawn. The world is, after all, full with other real concerns.

Spiegel depictions over the last decades. 1986 and 2015 were even front cover images. 1974: cooling. 1986: sea level rise. Now, 2015: it’s a burning planet.
1974 – 10,000 to 1 chance at best of planet returning to warming
In 1974 Spiegel warned of global cooling, writing that climate change was leading to growing deserts and global cooling. The article even claimed that the North Atlantic had cooled 0.5°C – this after “The global annual mean temperature increased by 0.7°C from 1890 to 1945.” During that warming period, Spiegel writes: “Near the poles the temperature was even several degrees warmer.”
In the lengthy article Spiegel even quoted meteorological researcher James McQuigg who said the chances of the climate returning to warmer conditions such as those in the 1930s were “at best 10,000 to 1”.
Also in Spiegel’s 11 February, 1974 edition an article titled The Desert is growing shows a temperature chart that tells us the global temperature fell from 16.0°C to 15.7°C from 1945 to 1970. Someone needs to tell this to NASA GISS. Today aren’t they saying the global temperature is now 14.9°? Weird.
1986: “Die Klimakatastrophe”
Then, just 12 years later in 1986, scientists realized the ocean cycles had flipped to their warm phase and so suddenly global warming was back in the pipeline. Immediately Spiegel ran with its legendary August 11, 1986 edition bearing the front page headline “Die Klimakatastrophe“, which depicted the Cologne Cathedral half submerged in sea water.
Forest die-off scare, acid rain
Spiegel not only spread fear about climate catastrophes, but it was also instrumental in spreading the acid-rain/forest die-off scare in the 1980s. In 1981 the magazine featured a 3-part series depicting the German forests as being doomed and certain to be forever lost.

Back to some rationality
Over the past years, it seemed Spiegel had been backing off from global climate catastrophe meme. The flagship news magazine often featured balanced reports, foremost by science journalist Axel Bojanowski, who often questioned the claims of a climate catastrophe and challenged the shrillness of the IPCC’s warnings. NoTricksZone often wrote about these articles. It seemed the magazine was back to rational and critical journalism on the topic of climate change, and this fostered hopes of a balanced debate someday taking place in Germany.
2015 Spiegel returns to the apocalypse
But this was wishful thinking, it turns out, as this week on Monday Spiegel rolled out its latest apocalyptic issue with the front page bearing the headline: “The Heated Planet” and an image of a planet on fire. The article is a repackaging all the doom and gloom scenarios that rest of the German mainstream media had been crowing about for a good two decades now. Balance has disappeared, regrettably.
Plummeting circulation
So why suddenly the change in tone? One can only speculate. Clear is that Spiegel circulation has been taking a massive beating over the recent years. For example in the 3rd quarter of 2014 alone Spiegel newsstand sales fell a whopping 12 percent, so reports the online horizont.net. 
The European Institute for Climate and Energy presents the chart for subscriptions to Spiegel:

Source: EIKE
Veteran science journalist Ulli Kulke of flagship Die Welt writes at his blog:
Does the new editorial board at Spiegel want to scale the magazine back to being a warrior on behalf of the environment? Will the critical journalism over the past years that questioned the increasingly baseless end-of-world-mood now come to an end? The new frontpage cover “The Heated Planet“ appears to be going back to the good old days of the apocalypse…”
PS: So far none of the catastrophes have come to pass.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski has an online interview with the Chairman of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo: The Church believes in science“.
Anyone with doubts the Vatican would abandon a neutral position on the science of climate change can now lay them to rest. Under Pope Francis the Vatican has been sending unmistakable signals that it is joining the junk-science based global warming movement, perhaps with the hopes of resurrecting the notorious system of indulgences (or a form of it) which for centuries swindled common people of their wealth and sent it to the coffers of the Roman Catholic Church.
The Church preaches that as stewards of the planet man must make responsible use of God-given resources, to use them sparingly, and that we share the fruits of our labors with the poor. Yet the Vatican never will do the same with its tens of billions in assets it has stashed away over the centuries.
In the interview Chairman Sorondo tells Bojanowski that “the Church believes in science – especially Galileo“. And on the upcoming encyclical on climate change, to be released in either June or July, Sorondo refuses to tell Spiegel what is going to be in it. “We will see.”
As to why there is even an encyclical on the climate to begin with, Sorondo tells Spiegel that it is to “provide an impulse” for the upcoming Paris Conference. The Lima Conference “disappointed the Pope”, Sorondo tells Spiegel.
On why a climate treaty is important, Chairman Sorondo spills the beans, telling Spiegel that “climate change has adverse impacts on the poorest two thirds of the world’s population who have no access to fossil energies but who have to bear the consequences of their consumption. Bartholomeos I, the Patriarch of Constantinople, compared climate change to modern slavery at the Conference of Religious Leaders in December.”
Clearly the Catholic Church is sympathetic to this extreme and preposterous position. Why would Chairman Sorondo cite it if it wasn’t. Unfortunately the Vatican fails to see that over the past 50 years fossil fuels have helped the poor far more than any Church’s redistributive plundering ever has over the last 1000 years. More often than not Church obstinate dogmatism often put the brakes on progress and as a result caused far more misery. It’s appalling that the Church fails to recognize that no God-given resource has been such a blessing to the poor as has affordable fossil fuels and that life as we know it today would be unimaginable without it.
Vatican sees Galileo as a “leading figure”
On why the Church is suddenly interested in environmental protection, Sorondo says it is so because “The Church believes in science.” A somewhat taken aback Bojanowski reacts skeptically and brings up the incident surrounding Galileo. Sorondo responds, claiming the Church never condemned Galileo: “He was only put to the test because his scientific evidence had not been convincing. Our Academy today views him as a leading figure.”
Isn’t that the way things usually turn out whenever blind consensus gets asserted and dogmatism prevail in science? For the Vatican unfortunately it took almost 400 years and man going to the moon before they became “convinced”.

Bojanowski responds forcefully, seemingly scoffing at the Chairman’s claim:
Galileo’s writings were banned by the Church, or were allowed to appear only in censored versions. He was no longer allowed to freely express himself on his theories. In court he was forced to accept what the Catholic Church regarded as true and was then subsequently punished with arrest. And his colleague Giordano Bruno had to endure much worse: Because he refused to recant his astronomical theories that opposed those of the Church, he was executed.”
Chairman Sorondo admits: “That was in any case a great injustice, and the Church acknowledged that.”
Bojanowski reminds the Chairman: “Well yeah, 400 years after the execution.”
That alone ought to drive home the dangers of religion deciding science. Can we really trust this Catholic Church and current pope on climate science?
Bojanowski also makes another important point: If the consensus of science supports a climate treaty, then why is the Vatican not playing along with the consensus on other scientific issues, like birth control? Here the Chairman is clearly in over his head.
So why is the Catholic Church taking the step of endorsing what is likely the most dubious, tampered and politicized science that civilization has seen in has seen in at least 100 years? Why is it teaming up with groups and political parties that are notorious proponents of abortion, population control, waging war, anti-Christianity and self-centered hedonism? One can only speculate.
To me it all reeks of Chicago-style politics. Perhaps there is a lot more rot in the Vatican than we may think – in addition to the scandals involving child molestation and shady finances. Someone seems to have gotten the goods on the Vatican, and now it’s: play along and everything will be okay, or else there’s going to be lots of trouble. Has the Vatican sold its soul?
As if it ever had one.

"In his controversial article “What if we stopped pretending?” published by The New Yorker magazine recently, acclaimed novelist Jonathan Franzen referred to the looming climate “apocalypse”, asserting  that, to prepare for it, we need to admit that we can’t prevent it. Naturally, it caused quite a stir among the climate-change vanguard. Some accused Franzen of scaremongering, saying it would drive people to anxiety or paralysis, thereby hindering action. Others felt it essential to people understanding just how bad the crisis is – and that this justified the tone of the story. The irony is that disagreement about the merits of the article seemed to cause more angst than its subject matter. Actually, while it’s easy to pick fault with some of the facts and suggested actions (as many people have) the article is fairly balanced. The key message for me was not one of defeat, but of hope, despite the vulnerability of the situation – or as Franzen says: If your hope for the future depends on a wildly optimistic scenario, what will you do 10 years from now, when the scenario becomes unworkable, even in theory? Give up on the planet entirely? … It’s fine to struggle against the constraints of human nature, hoping to mitigate the worst of what’s to come, but it’s just as important to fight smaller, more local battles that you have some realistic hope of winning. Franzen’s take on the climate crisis reminds me of an anecdote referred to as the “Stockdale Paradox”, named after Admiral James Stockdale, which was popularised by Jim Collins in his business book Good to Great. Stockdale was kept prisoner for seven years during the Vietnam War, regularly tortured and kept in solitary confinement; the paradox is based on what he observed during that time. When Collins asked Stockdale who didn’t make it out of the PoW camp, he replied: “Oh, that’s easy. It was the optimists.” Stockdale explained that it was the optimists who always said: “We’re going to be out by Christmas.” Then Christmas would come and it would go. Then another Christmas would go by. And they simply gave up. Stockdale said: “You must never ever ever confuse … the need for absolute, unwavering faith that you can prevail despite those constraints, with … the need for the discipline to … [confront] the brutal facts, whatever they are.” Or as Collins paraphrased it in his book on leadership and great companies: confront the brutal facts, but never lose faith. The Stockdale Paradox is widely quoted in leadership and management courses. Marketing and management academic Martin Bressler uses it to explain what he calls “balancing the now and the next”: Stockdale held beliefs of optimism about the future, while simultaneously acknowledging the current reality of the desperate situation in which he found himself. This contradictory tension enabled him and his followers to emerge from their situation not just unbroken, but stronger … This apparent dichotomy provides an important lesson for leaders who must remain optimistic, yet face the reality of their present condition, and is symbolic of an overarching, general tension leaders face in addressing “the now and the next”.  Whatever you may think of its tone, Franzen’s article does just that – setting out the hard facts about what could happen as the crisis plays out, but also providing an optimistic take on what we can do in the here and now. It’s similar to what Al Gore did in An Inconvenient Truth and Naomi Klein in This Changes Everything. Now it is the turn of Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg. Thanks to them we are all properly starting to face the “brutal facts” of our climate crisis, while also embracing the positive opportunities that will come if we actively pursue a transition to sustainable systems. They are all showing leadership. This paradox lies at the heart of how I teach sustainable development. First, understand the enormity of what has gone wrong: look at the scale of environmental destruction caused by mining as well as the toxic level of pollutants released by industry. Bear in mind how every bit of plastic ever made is still in existence, breaking down into smaller and smaller particles which are detected in our food, our water and the air we breathe. Look at the sheer misery of human life in the squalid rubbish mountains we have created in far-flung parts of the world, which all too closely resemble Franzen’s apocalyptic scenes. At the same time embrace the fact that we do know how to turn this around – we do have the technology, we do have renewable energies, we do understand the science – all we need is the collective will to just do it. This balance between optimism and pragmatism is taken up in a review of Franzen’s article, in a blog post by Ajay Gambhir of the Grantham Institute, a centre for research and education on climate change:  Pragmatic optimism, rather than complacency or despondency, is the best way to tackle the climate emergency. Being mindful of potential disasters gives us a context in which to plan for them and potentially increase our actions to minimise their impacts. To do so we need to be optimistic. This needn’t be blind optimism. We should temper our hopes that we will achieve our climate goals with active planning towards the possibility that we will fall short. A consistent message shines through: face the reality but know it can be changed. Be pragmatic – don’t pretend the climate emergency is anything less than an emergency, but remain optimistic and proactive. Take part in civil actions such as the Climate Strike. Lobby politicians. Make little changes in how you live and shop and get about. Talk about it with your children, friends, neighbours, colleagues. And be encouraged that by taking whatever actions are necessary, humanity can avert the worst-case scenario and revert to a sustainable way of living."

 ** _Policymakers should_**



• seek to dampen excessive alarmism over the issues of nuclear proliferation and atomic terrorism;  
• consider that nuclear proliferation is unlikely to accelerate or prove to be a major danger;  
• be wary of the potentially destructive consequences of some counter‐​proliferation policies;  
• understand that one way to reduce the likelihood that errant regimes will seek nuclear arsenals is to stop threatening them; and  
• recognize that the likelihood terrorists will be able to acquire a nuclear capacity is vanishingly low.



The foreign policy establishment has long taken it as a central article of faith that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is an overwhelming danger and that great efforts, including perhaps even war, must be undertaken to keep it from happening. Alarm escalated after the experience of September 11, 2001, which raised concerns that terrorists might obtain nuclear weapons — even though the terrorists on that tragic day used weapons no more sophisticated than box cutters.



However, nuclear proliferation is unlikely to accelerate or prove to be a major danger. Terrorists are likely to continue to find that obtaining and using nuclear weapons is exceedingly difficult. And aggressive counter‐​proliferation policies can generate costs far higher than those likely to be inflicted by the proliferation problem they seek to address. Those policies need careful reconsideration.



Except for their effects on agonies, obsessions, rhetoric, posturing, and spending, the consequences of nuclear proliferation have been largely benign: those who have acquired the weapons have “used” them simply to stoke their egos or to deter real or imagined threats. For the most part, nuclear powers have found the weapons to be a notable waste of time, money, effort, and scientific talent. They have quietly kept the weapons in storage and haven’t even found much benefit in rattling them from time to time. If the recent efforts to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons have been successful, those efforts have done Iran a favor.



There has never been a militarily compelling reason to use nuclear weapons, particularly because it has not been possible to identify suitable targets — or targets that couldn’t be attacked as effectively by conventional munitions. Conceivably, conditions exist under which nuclear weapons could serve a deterrent function, but there is little reason to suspect that they have been necessary to deter war thus far, even during the Cold War. The main Cold War contestants have never believed that a repetition of World War II, whether embellished by nuclear weapons or not, is remotely in their interests.



Moreover, the weapons have not proved to be crucial status symbols. How much more status would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? Would anybody pay a great deal more attention to Britain or France if their arsenals held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or much less if they had none? Did China need nuclear weapons to impress the world with its economic growth or its Olympics?



Those considerations help explain why alarmists have been wrong for decades about the pace of nuclear proliferation. Most famously, in the 1960s, President John Kennedy anticipated that in another decade “fifteen or twenty or twenty‐​five nations may have these weapons.” Yet, of the dozens of technologically capable countries that have considered obtaining nuclear arsenals, very few have done so. Insofar as most leaders of most countries (even rogue ones) have considered acquiring the weapons, they have come to appreciate several drawbacks of doing so: nuclear weapons are dangerous, costly, and likely to rile the neighbors. Moreover, as the University of Southern California’s Jacques Hymans has demonstrated, the weapons have also been exceedingly difficult for administratively dysfunctional countries to obtain — it took decades for North Korea and Pakistan to do so. In consequence, alarmist predictions about proliferation chains, cascades, dominoes, waves, avalanches, epidemics, and points of no return have proved faulty.



Although proliferation has so far had little consequence, that is not because the only countries to get nuclear weapons have had rational leaders. Large, important countries that acquired the bomb were run at the time by unchallenged — perhaps certifiably deranged — monsters. Consider Joseph Stalin, who, in 1949, was planning to change the climate of the Soviet Union by planting a lot of trees, and Mao Zedong, who, in 1964, had just carried out a bizarre social experiment that resulted in an artificial famine in which tens of millions of Chinese perished.



Some also fear that a country might use its nuclear weapons to “dominate” its area. That argument was used with dramatic urgency before 2003 when Saddam Hussein supposedly posed great danger, and it has been frequently applied to Iran. Exactly how that domination is to be carried out is never made clear. The notion, apparently, is this: should an atomic rogue state rattle the occasional rocket, other countries in the area, suitably intimidated, would bow to its demands. Far more likely, threatened states would make common cause with each other and with other concerned countries (including nuclear ones) against the threatening neighbor. That is how countries coalesced into an alliance of convenience to oppose Iraq’s region‐​threatening invasion of Kuwait in 1990.



Yet another concern has been that the weapons will go off, by accident or miscalculation, devastating the planet in the process: the weapons exist in the thousands, sooner or later one or more of them will inevitably go off. But those prognostications have now failed to deliver for 70 years. That time period suggests something more than luck is operating. Moreover, the notion that if one nuclear weapon goes off in one place, the world will necessarily be plunged into thermonuclear cataclysm should remain in the domain of Hollywood scriptwriters.



Also keep in mind that anti‐​proliferation efforts can be counterproductive in their own terms. Thus, “one of the unintended ‘demonstration’ effects of the American anti‐​proliferation war against Iraq,” notes Mitchell Reiss, an expert on nuclear proliferation, “was that chemical and biological weapons proved insufficient to deter America: only nuclear weapons, it appeared, could do this job.” North Korea has apparently learned this lesson. Insofar as nuclear proliferation is a response to perceived threat, one way to reduce the nuclear pace is simple: stop threatening countries that might consider acquiring them.



The impulse to prevent nuclear proliferation through any means available should be weighed against the potentially very high costs of counter‐​proliferation wars. The war in Iraq, with well over a hundred thousand deaths, is a key case in point. The war against Saddam Hussein was a militarized counter‐​proliferation effort substantially sold as necessary to keep his pathetic regime from developing nuclear and other presumably threatening weapons, and to prevent him from transferring some of them to eager and congenial terrorists. Karl Rove, President George W. Bush’s top political adviser, reflected in 2008 that, absent this belief, “I suspect that the administration’s course of action would have been to work to find more creative ways to constrain him like in the ‘90s.”



The possibility that small groups could set off nuclear weapons is an alarm that has been raised repeatedly over the decades. However, terrorist groups thus far seem to have exhibited only limited desire and even less progress in going atomic. Perhaps, after a brief exploration of the possible routes, they have discovered that the tremendous effort required is scarcely likely to succeed.



One route a would‐​be atomic terrorist might take would be to receive or buy a bomb from a generous, like‐​minded nuclear state for delivery abroad. That route, however, is highly improbable. The risk would be too great — even for a country led by extremists — that the source of the weapon would ultimately be discovered. Here, the rapidly developing science (and art) of “nuclear forensics” — connecting nuclear materials to their sources even after a bomb has been detonated — provides an important deterrent. Moreover, the weapon could explode in a manner or on a target the donor would not approve — including, potentially, the donor itself. Almost no one, for example, is likely to trust al Qaeda: its explicit enemies list includes all Middle Eastern regimes, as well as the governments of Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Russia. And the Islamic State, or ISIS, which burst onto the international scene in 2014, has alienated just about every state on the planet.



Nuclear‐​armed states are unlikely to give or sell their precious weapons to nonstate actors. Some observers, though, worry about “loose nukes,” especially in post‐​Communist Russia — meaning weapons, “suitcase bombs” in particular, that can be stolen or bought illicitly. However, as a former director at the Los Alamos National Laboratory notes, “Regardless of what is reported in the news, all nuclear nations take the security of their weapons very seriously.” Careful assessments have concluded that it is unlikely that any nuclear devices have been lost and that, regardless, their effectiveness would be very low or even nonexistent because nuclear weapons require continual maintenance.



Moreover, finished bombs are outfitted with devices designed to trigger a nonnuclear explosion that will destroy the bomb if it is tampered with. Bombs can also be kept disassembled with the component parts stored in separate high‐​security vaults (a common practice in Pakistan). Two or more people and multiple codes may be required not only to use the bomb, but also to store, maintain, and deploy it.



There could be dangers in the chaos that would emerge if a nuclear state were to fail, collapsing in full disarray. However, even under those conditions, nuclear weapons would still have locks or be disassembled and would likely remain under heavy guard by people who know that a purloined bomb would most likely end up going off in their own territory.



Most analysts believe that a terrorist group’s most promising route would be to attempt to make a bomb using purloined fissile material — plutonium or highly enriched uranium. However, as the Gilmore Commission — the advisory panel on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction — stressed, building and deploying a nuclear device presents “Herculean challenges.” The process requires a lengthy sequence of steps; if each is not fully met, the result is not simply a less powerful weapon, but one that can’t produce any significant nuclear yield at all or can’t be delivered.



First, the terrorists would need to steal or illicitly purchase the crucial plutonium or highly enriched uranium. This would most likely require the corruption of a host of greedy confederates, including brokers and money transmitters, any one of whom could turn on the terrorists or, out of either guile or incompetence, furnish them with material that is useless. Any theft would also likely trigger an intense international policing effort.



Second, to manufacture a bomb, the terrorists would need to set up a large and well‐​equipped machine shop and populate it with a team of highly skilled and extremely devoted scientists, technicians, machinists, and managers. These people would have to be assembled and retained for the monumental task while generating no consequential suspicions among friends, family, or police about their sudden and lengthy absence from normal pursuits back home. Throughout, the process of fabricating a nuclear weapon would require that international and local security services be kept perpetually in the dark, and that no curious locals, including criminal gangs, get wind of the project as they observe the constant coming and going of outside technicians over the months or even years it would take to pull off.



Physicists who have studied the issue conclude that fabricating a nuclear weapon “could hardly be accomplished by a subnational group” because of “the difficulty of acquiring the necessary expertise, the technical requirements (which in several fields verge on the unfeasible), the lack of available materials and the lack of experience in working with these.” Others stress the “daunting problems associated with material purity, machining, and a host of other issues,” and conclude that the notion that a terrorist group could fabricate an atomic bomb or device “is far‐​fetched at best.”



Finally, the resulting weapon, likely weighing a ton or more, would have to be moved to a target site in a manner that did not arouse suspicion. Then a skilled crew would have to set off the improvised and untested nuclear device, hoping that the machine shop work has been perfect, that there were no significant shakeups in the treacherous process of transportation, and that the device, after all the effort, isn’t a dud.



The financial costs of such an extensive operation could easily become monumental: expensive equipment to buy, smuggle, and set up and people to pay — or pay off. Any criminals competent and capable enough to be effective allies in the project would likely discover boundless opportunities for extortion and be psychologically equipped by their profession to exploit them.



Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the designated “mastermind” behind the 9/11 attacks, reportedly said that al Qaeda’s atom bomb efforts never went beyond searching the Internet. Even so, that raises the popular notion that the Internet can be effective in providing operational information. However, that belief seems to be severely flawed. Researcher Anne Stenersen finds that the Internet is filled with misinformation and error and with materials hastily assembled and “randomly put together,” containing information that is often “far‐​fetched” or “utter nonsense.”



Some members of al Qaeda may have dreamed about getting nuclear weapons. The only terrorist group to actually indulge in such dreams has been the Japanese millennial group Aum Shinrikyo. However, its experience can scarcely be much of an inspiration to other terrorist groups. Aum Shinrikyo was not under siege or even under close watch, and it had some 300 scientists in its employ, an estimated budget of $1 billion, and a remote and secluded haven in which to set up shop. After making dozens of mistakes in judgment, planning, and execution in a quest for nuclear weapons, it abandoned its efforts.



The rise of ISIS in 2014 does not alter these conclusions. The vicious group is certainly a danger to the people under its control and to fellow Muslims and neighboring Christians. It is actually more visible — that is, easier to find — than al Qaeda in that it seeks to hold and govern physical territory, a task that is increasingly difficult in a hostile world. In the process, it is unlikely to be able to amass the finances, the skills, and the serenity to go atomic.



The notion that terrorists could come up with a nuclear weapon seems remote. As with nuclear proliferation to countries, there may be reason for concern, or at least for interest and watchfulness. But alarm and hysteria are hardly called for.

"Republicans on Thursday took one of their first steps to officially dismantle   environmental regulations by easing restrictions on coal mining, bolstering an industry that President Trump has made a symbol of America’s neglected heartland. Using an obscure law that allows Congress to review regulations before they take effect, the Senate voted to reverse the Stream Protection Rule, which seeks to protect the nation’s waterways from debris generated by a practice called surface mining. The Interior Department had said the rule would protect 6, 000 miles of streams and 52, 000 acres of forests by keeping coal mining debris away from nearby waters. The Senate vote was 54 to 45, following a House vote for repeal on Wednesday. “Make no mistake about it, this Obama administration rule is not designed to protect streams,” Representative Bill Johnson, a Republican from Ohio who sponsored the move to reverse the rule, said on Wednesday. “Instead, it was an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business. ” The Senate also moved to reverse a separate rule requiring publicly traded oil, gas and mineral companies to disclose payments to foreign governments for licenses or permits. The disclosure rule was aimed at curbing bribery and at helping   developing countries hold   companies, and their governments, accountable. After a procedural vote on Thursday, final Senate action to cancel the rule is expected Friday, with Mr. Trump’s signature to follow. The Trump administration, which has vowed to peel back regulations, is particularly close to the fossil fuel industry. On Wednesday, the Senate confirmed President Trump’s pick for secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, the former chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil. Exxon had argued that forcing American oil companies to reveal payments to foreign governments would put them at a competitive disadvantage. Full disclosure could also have made it trickier for Exxon to pursue business deals in countries like Russia, where the state plays a central role. Both the coal and   rules were made final in the last days of the Obama administration, putting them in the cross hairs of the   Congress, together with other   Obama regulations yet to take effect. The Stream Protection Rule, which requires companies to restore mined areas to their original physical and ecological state and to monitor for environmental effects, would have effectively made mountaintop removal uneconomical, experts said  —   especially when coal prices remain depressed amid competition from natural gas and renewable energy sources like wind and solar. But the rule was challenged in court almost immediately by Republican attorneys general in states across the country, as well as the   coal giant Murray Energy. The company had previously filed 14, 000 pages of comments opposing stronger regulations. “This unlawful and destructive rule is nothing but a thinly veiled attempt to destroy our nation’s underground coal mines and put our nation’s coal miners out of work,” Robert E. Murray, the company’s chief executive, said in comments released ahead of Thursday’s vote. A report released by the Congressional Research Service last month laid out the environmental and health benefits of the rule. Stream restoration requirements would reduce human exposure to contaminants in the drinking water, and the probability of adverse health effects, the report said. The replanting of trees also required by the rule would increase carbon storage and reduce emissions, aiding in the fight against climate change, the report said. The report also outlined the costs to industry: $52 million in annual compliance costs for the coal industry as a whole, of which roughly half was expected to be borne by mining operations in Appalachia. The rule could endanger up to 590 coal mining jobs in the region, the report estimated, though the losses would be partly offset by engineers and biologists that companies would need to hire to comply with its terms. Even without the rule, coal industry employment would shrink by more than 15, 000 workers, from a total of 90, 000 in 2012, the report noted. Still, on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump had pointed to coal mining’s decline as a symptom of overzealous environmental regulation and the neglect of   Americans by coastal elites. He vowed that, as president, he would “put our miners back to work”  —   a promise that resonated with voters in battleground states, including those in Appalachia. But the American market for coal is shrinking, with or without new rules and regulations. Utility companies have drastically reduced their reliance on coal. Nationally, about 300   power plants have closed since 2008, according to the National Mining Association, a trade group. Many of those plants are not coming back, whatever the policy out of Washington, making it imperative that Appalachia diversify its economy, industry analysts say. Daile Rois, 56, lives about 2, 000 feet from a shuttered coal mine outside Charleston, W. Va. The mine, Keystone Development No. 2, released debris and chemicals into two creeks that meet at the edge of her property and run past her home. After intense opposition from environmental groups, which documented streams clouded by sediment and monitored rising acidity levels, West Virginia’s Department of Environmental Protection permanently closed the mine last year and ordered the operator to restore the site  —   a rare victory for local environmentalists. “Here in West Virginia, many creeks run orange” from the contamination, said Ms. Rois, who moved to West Virginia in 2012 with her partner to take care of elderly relatives. She called the Republican vote to repeal the Stream Protection Rule devastating, a move that would allow mines like Keystone to stay open. “Of course I care about miners’ jobs, and I care about their safety,” Ms. Rois said. “But orange is not the color of water. ”"
"Official dietary advice across the world is harming both the environment and people’s health, according to scientists who have carried out the most comprehensive assessment of national dietary guidelines to date. Food is responsible for a quarter of the emissions driving the climate crisis and millions of early deaths. The analysis assessed all available dietary guidelines, covering 85 countries and every region of the world. The researchers said governments’ failure to help people eat good diets was “shocking”.  In every country studied, the study found the diets people are eating today contain more red and processed meat than recommended by national or World Health Organization guidelines, and too little fruit and vegetables, beans, nuts and whole grains in all but a few countries. However, even if these guidelines were followed, the research showed only two countries had dietary guidelines in line with health, climate and pollution targets set by governments. The researchers also assessed the impact of a “planetary health diet”, published by scientists in 2019, which recommends cutting red meat consumption by three-quarters in developed countries. Adopting this diet, and using campaigns and regulation to help people meet its requirements, would lead to big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the number of diet-related early deaths from illnesses including heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes. In the UK, following the planetary health diet would cut food-related emissions by 70% and diet-related deaths by 104,000 every year, compared with people’s current diets. In the US, where the study found the average citizen’s actual diet does not meet national advice for any food groups, emissions would fall 74% and deaths by 585,000. The emissions cut would be even greater in Australia – 86% – with a 31,000 fall in deaths. “Countries are surprisingly bad in helping their populations to eat what they say is a good diet,” said Marco Springmann, at the University of Oxford, who led the study. “It was really shocking.” “Most governments shy away from providing clear recommendations on limiting the consumption of [meat and dairy], despite their exceptionally high emissions and resource use,” he said. “The evidence of the environmental impact of our dietary choices is mounting, so it is really essential that official dietary advice is in line with that.” The research, published in the British Medical Journal, assessed the dietary guidelines against five environmental targets and one health target to which governments have signed up. The health target is to cut early deaths from non-infectious diseases by a third, while the environment targets related to the 2C limit in global heating set by the Paris deal, the destruction of wild areas, freshwater use and nitrogen and phosphate pollution from farming. The national dietary guidelines of just two of the 85 countries – Indonesia and Sierra Leone – were compatible with all six of these targets while the guidelines from 74 countries failed to meet the Paris goal. The researchers recommend that nations set new dietary guidelines in line with the current science, including “stringent” limits on beef and dairy in countries where they are eaten in large amounts. Governments should also provide examples of healthy and sustainable diets, including plant-based ones. “But even the best dietary guidelines are meaningless if they are not backed up by targeted health promotion programmes,” Springmann said. “These really need much bigger investment. Also needed is much stronger regulation of the whole food system, including food companies.” Governments also buy a lot of food, in schools for example, and could use this to encourage shifts in diets. Public sector caterers serving billions of meals a year in UK schools, universities, hospitals and care homes have already pledged to cut the amount of meat they serve by 20%. “In overall terms, the [planetary health diet] seems superior in terms of reducing mortality from non-communicable diseases and cutting greenhouse gas emissions,” said Lukas Schwingshackl, at the Institute for Evidence in Medicine at the University of Freiburg, Germany, and two colleagues in a commentary in the BMJ. “However, adopting the [planetary health diet] globally would not be affordable for many in low income countries without economic growth and improved local food production and supply,” they said. Springmann said people in poor countries often eat monotonous diets based on a single grain or root and that any addition of other foods would increase costs. He said the question was how to help improve these diets: “Do you want them to adopt a more western diet that will be unhealthy and unsustainable? Or do you want them to transition to a healthy and sustainable diet in the medium term?”"

…or Introductions to the Impacts of El Niños on Global Weather Patterns and to the Long-Term Effects of Strong El Niño Events on Global Surface Temperatures 
Since the first of the year, there have been hundreds, possibly thousands, of news stories about the growing possibility of a strong El Niño evolving this year. Your local weather forecaster has probably mentioned it a couple of times over the past few months. Joe Bastardi of WeatherBELL Analytics has made regular visits to the cross posts of this series at WattsUpWithThat. Also in that time, the blogosphere has been alight about the possible El Niño…with many of the posts by climate alarmists providing more misinformation than facts. We discussed one of those alarmist posts in The 2014/15 El Niño – Part 2 – The Alarmist Misinformation (BS) Begins.
Because El Niño events are typically tied to the seasonal cycle, this El Niño, if it continues to develop and it likely will, would peak in November 2014 to January 2015. So you may be wondering why there’s all the interest in some slow-developing weather event that may happen to grow throughout the rest of the year.
In short, El Niño events cause massive changes in “normal” weather patterns around the globe and El Niño events can cause long-term changes in global surface temperatures. A more detailed answer…

THERE ARE NO OTHER WEATHER-RELATED EVENTS ON EARTH THAT COMPARE IN MAGNITUDE TO AN EL NIÑO
El Niño events are by far the largest of any weather-related phenomenon taking place on the planet, and they impact weather around the globe. If you think tropical cyclones (hurricanes) are big, sometimes it takes two cyclones straddling the equator in the western Pacific just to kick start the initial processes that might cause an El Niño to form. Only catastrophic explosive volcanic eruptions like El Chichon in 1982 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 can counteract the global effects of an El Niño.
We’ve all seen animations of hurricanes forming over the eastern tropical North Atlantic, just west of Africa, and we’ve watched the satellite images of those hurricanes spiraling as they march their way westward toward the Americas. (Those of us living along the Atlantic or Gulf coasts watch a little more closely.) As an El Niño develops thousands of miles west in the tropical Pacific, that developing El Niño suppresses the formation of hurricanes by chopping off their tops…through a phenomenon called wind shear. That’s why forecasters reduce the number of possible hurricanes during an El Niño-development year. The impact of El Niños on hurricanes was first reported by longtime hurricane forecaster Dr. William Gray, Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. See Gray (1984) Atlantic Seasonal Hurricane Frequency. Part I: El Niño and 30 mb Quasi-Biennial Oscillation Influencesand Atlantic Seasonal Hurricane Frequency. Part II: Forecasting its Variability.
Parts of the U.S., Australia and other regions around the globe have been plagued recently by drought. The persons living through them understand that the lack of precipitation has been influenced, to some extent, by the recent dominance of La Niña events (or the non-Niño 2013/14 season). La Niña events, though the processes behind them are not the opposite of El Niño events, can have effects on regional weather that tend to be the opposite of El Niños—with tend being the operative word in that sentence. So droughts might be lessened in some parts of the globe if an El Niño forms this year.
Correction:  I’ve crossed out Australia in the above paragraph.  As I was reminded in comments, in Australia, droughts are associated with El Niño. And that agrees with my later description of precipitation migrating eastward during an El Niño, accompanying the warm water. (Thanks, Nick and Angech.)
On the GRID-Arendal webpage Climate impacts of El Niño Phenomenon in Latin America and the Caribbean, they provide a map (Figure 1) which shows the impacts of the 1997/98 El Niño on those regions. Note the graph that presents the impact of that El Niño on the fishing industry. Fisherman there would not be looking forward to a strong El Niño.

Figure 1
The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) webpage Effects of El Niño on world weather illustrates the typical impacts of El Niño events on precipitation, temperature and tropical cyclones around the globe, on seasonal (quarterly) bases. Lots of detail.
Because El Niño events can have strong impacts on Australia’s weather, their Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has numerous El Niño-related webpages, including, for example:

ENSO Wrap-Up – Current state of the Pacific and Indian Ocean
Risk Management and El Niño and La Niña
Australian rainfall patterns during El Niño events

NOAA has a multitude of webpages about the impacts of El Niño events, including:

El Niño Impacts
El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Diagnostic Discussion, which includes their Weekly ENSO Update (pdf)
Weather Impacts of ENSO

The UK Met Office (UKMO) has a similar webpage titled ENSO Impacts, where ENSO stands for El Niño-Southern Oscillation. El Niño in that commonly used term represents the ocean component and the Southern Oscillation represents the atmospheric side. Figure 2 shows the maps prepared by the UKMO for El Niños, with precipitation on the left and temperature on the right.

Figure 2 (Click to enlarge.)
The UKMO includes the following note of caution (their boldface):
Each ENSO event is different, and occurs in conjunction with other climatic events. Not all impacts occur in all events, and impacts may not be confined to the regions indicated. Thus these maps should not be regarded as forecasts for a current event, but rather as an indication of areas where impacts are likely, based on historical evidence.
Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also has El Niño Monitoring and Outlook discussions.
Researchers at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) have been studying the differences in the impacts on weather of Central Pacific El Niño events (El Niño Modoki) and East Pacific El Niño events. Yes, El Niños come in different flavors depending on which part of the equatorial Pacific they directly influence. As their names imply, some El Niños are focused more toward the central part of the equatorial Pacific, while others, the stronger ones, also extend into the eastern portion. See Ashok et al. (2007) El Niño Modoki and Its Possible Teleconnection.
Now you may be wondering how a weather-related event in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific causes all of those changes in weather patterns around the globe.
It’s a matter of scale.
WEATHER PATTERNS AROUND THE GLOBE DEPEND ON THE STATE OF THE TROPICAL PACIFIC
I’m going to borrow parts of a couple of illustrations from my book Who Turned on the Heat? for this portion of the discussion. But first, I want to try to impress on you the size of the tropical Pacific.
There are lots of stats about the monstrous scale of the Pacific. The Pacific Ocean covers about 33% of the surface of the globe, more than the continental land masses combined. El Niño events take place along the equator in the Pacific, and the equatorial Pacific stretches almost halfway around the globe as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3
The 1997/98 El Niño had caused warm water from the western equatorial Pacific to shift eastward about one-quarter of the way around the globe, Figure 4, temporarily raising the sea surface temperatures west of the Galapagos Islands 5 to 6 deg C (9 to 11 deg F). (See the discussion of Animation 1 and Figures 7 through 9 in the post here.)

Figure 4
Figure 5 is a cartoon-like image of the Pacific Ocean during “normal” conditions (aka ENSO-neutral conditions). The trade winds blow across the surface of the tropical Pacific and the sunlight-warmed water accumulates in an area of the western tropical Pacific known as the West Pacific Warm Pool. In effect, it’s “stacking up” against the land masses there. As a result of that trade-wind-blown process, the West Pacific Warm Pool contains some of the warmest ocean water on the planet. With the warm water comes lots of evaporation. As the warm moist air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds and eventually falling as rain. Rainfall in that part of the world is also extremely high.

Figure 5
(Note: For a detailed cartoon-based introduction to El Niño and La Niña events see the post here. Where most introductions to ENSO include 3 cartoons—one each for El Niño, ENSO-neutral, and La Niña conditions—that post includes 29 illustrations.)
Back to scale and the enormity of the Pacific: the West Pacific Warm Pool can grow to be the size of Russia or about twice the size of the United States, and that pool of warm water can be 300 meters deep in places.
Because West Pacific Warm Pool is so large, and because the water is naturally so warm, it is one of the primary sources of moisture for the atmosphere globally, and because of its enormity and warmth and because of its impact on atmospheric circulation, the West Pacific Warm Pool helps to direct the locations of the jet streams in both hemispheres. So “normal” weather on the planet is, in effect, partly governed by the location of all of that warm water in the western tropical Pacific.
During an El Niño, that warm water floods eastward. See Figure 6.

Figure 6
The convection, the clouds, and the precipitation accompany the warm water, so they too head to the east during an El Nino. The jet streams in both hemispheres shift as well, impacting regional weather around the globe. (See the brief introductory discussion of the impacts of El Niños on the jet streams at the NOAA webpage here.) Some places are warmer than normal during an El Nino, others are cooler, but because the areas that warm and the amount they warm (as a result of those El Niño-caused changes in atmospheric circulation) are greater than the regions that cool, global surface temperatures around the globe rise in response to the El Nino…and they do it without a direct exchange of heat from the tropical Pacific. (See Trenberth et al (2002) for a detailed scientific discussion of how, where and why portions of the globe warm during an El Niño without a direct exchange of heat with the tropical Pacific.) The shifts in the locations of the jet streams in both hemispheres also alter precipitation patterns globally. In some parts of the globe, precipitation increases, and if it escalates enough, there’s flooding. In other regions, precipitation decreases, and if rainfall and snowfall decline enough, there’s drought. Globally, drought is more likely that flooding during an El Nino, because precipitation on land decreases during an El Niño and increases over the oceans. This can be seen in the comparison graph of global precipitation for land and oceans, Figure 7, which I borrowed from an earlier post here. The large upward spike in ocean-based precipitation in the late 1990s is the response to the 1997/98 El Niño, as is the massive dip and rebound in land-based precipitation. Most of the other spikes in ocean precipitation are also responses to El Niños, as are most of the dips in land precipitation. (The significant dip in land precipitation in the early 1990s appears to be a response to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.)

Figure 7
Much of the increase in precipitation over the oceans during an El Niño occurs in the tropical Pacific. As the warm water from the West Pacific Warm Pool spreads east across the tropical Pacific during an El Niño (centered along the equator), more of the tropical Pacific is covered by warm water. With the warm water covering a greater surface area of the tropical Pacific, there’s much more evaporation, cloud cover and precipitation there. (Evaporation is the primary way that an El Niño releases heat from the tropical Pacific to the atmosphere.) El Niño events cause global sea levels to rise, because precipitation increases over the oceans and decreases on land. This relationship can be seen if we detrend global satellite-based sea level data and compare it to a commonly used index for the strength, frequency and duration of El Niño and La Niña events (the Multivariate ENSO Index). See Figure 8. (See the post here for a further discussion.)

Figure 8
Back in the late 1990s, in response to the very strong 1997/98 El Niño, almost every weather event on the planet was blamed on El Niño. Cartoons about El Niño effects became commonplace. There used to be a collection of them at the Florida State University (FSU) Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies (COAPS) website. Sadly, it appears FSU has removed them. Some were quite funny. Of course, there’s still a portion of the Saturday Night Live El Niño skit with Chris Farley on YouTube.
To sum up this section, El Niño events can cause drastic changes in “normal” weather patterns. Some of the changes may be good for some parts of the globe, and in others, the changes caused by a strong El Niño may be catastrophic. One thing for sure: there will be people blaming any weather catastrophe on hypothetical human-induced global warming.
WHY PROPONENTS OF HUMAN-INDUCED GLOBAL WARMING ARE HOPING FOR A STRONG EL NIÑO 
It has been well known for decades that global surface temperatures warm in response to El Niño events and cool in response to La Niñas. (But they don’t cool proportionally during La Niñas, and we’ll expand on this later in this section.) Figure 9 presents the global surface temperature anomalies based on the average of the three suppliers: GISS, NCDC and UKMO. Also shown are the average of the global lower troposphere temperature anomalies based on the RSS and UAH datasets. Both averages have been smoothed with 12-month filters to reduce the seasonal components and weather noise. I’ve highlighted the spikey responses of global surface temperatures to the stronger El Niño events. La Niña events are responsible for most of the dips. The exception to that is the large dip caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991.

Figure 9
It should be obvious from Figure 9 why global warming alarmists are looking forward to a strong El Niño for the 2014/15 ENSO season. It’s possible 2014 would be the warmest on record. But because the global effects of an El Niño peak a few months after the event tops out in the tropical Pacific around December, it’s likely that 2015 would be the warmest on record if there was a strong El Niño in 2014/15, bringing a quick end to the hiatus in global warming. Well, that’s what they’re hoping for.
As I noted on Figure 10, proponents of human-induced global warming believe, and would like you to believe, that the manmade greenhouse gases are responsible for the warming over that time period, while El Niño and La Niña events only create noise in the temperature record. Their hypothesis of human-induced global warming depends on that relationship.

Figure 10
We can see evidence of this in the way that alarmists portray the instrument temperature record. Refer to the SkepticalScience animation on their recent ENSO Temperature Trends webpage. There they write in explanation of the first frame of their animation:
First Frame: The Cowtan & Way (2013) global surface temperature data show a clear increasing trend, but it is “noisy” because multiple influences are present in the data (AGW, ENSO, volcanoes, solar cycle).
Of course, any portrayal of El Niño and La Niña events as noise is intended to mislead or misdirect. It’s nothing more than nonsense based on their misunderstandings or misrepresentations of El Niño and La Niña processes. There are a number of other examples being used by the global warming enthusiasts.
But last year one of the former lead authors of two IPCC assessment reports and a well-known expert on El Niño presented a different view of how global warming occurred: in steps, in “big jumps”, not continuously. Apparently proponents of manmade global warming failed to understand the significance of that simple presentation. The graph is presented as Figure 11. It is the only illustration in the Royal Meteorological Society article “Has Global Warming Stalled”, written by NCAR’s Kevin Trenberth. (Note: The dashed horizontal blue lines are not explained in the article. They are period-average temperatures, not trends.)

 
Figure 11
Dr. Trenberth failed to discuss the causes of the “big jumps” in his RMS article. In the blog post Open Letter to the Royal Meteorological Society Regarding Dr. Trenberth’s Article “Has Global Warming Stalled?” (WattsUpWithThat cross post is here.), however, I illustrated and discussed the reasons for them. They were the Pacific Climate Shift of 1976, the 1986/87/88 El Niño and the 1997/98 El Niño. See Figure 12. In that blog post, I provided a short introduction to the processes through which those two strong El Niño events caused upward shifts in the sea surface temperatures of the global oceans. I also provided a link to my well-illustrated essay “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge” (42MB), which is a more detailed introductory discussion of the processes through which strong El Niño events cause the upward shifts in sea surface temperatures, and in turn global surface temperatures.

 
Figure 12
We have been illustrating and discussing the long-term effects of El Niño and La Niña events for more than 5-years. My first presentations of those effects were in the two-part January 2009 blog series “Can El Niño Events Explain All of the Global Warming since 1976?” Part 1 is here and Part 2 is here, with the cross posts at WattsUpWithThat hereand here. Since that time, we have confirmed in numerous blog posts and in numerous ways that an El Niño is the discharge phase of a recharge-discharge-redistribute process that is chaotic, naturally occurring and sunlight fueled. (Thanks to all of you, here at ClimateObservations and at WattsUpWithThat, who contributed to our understanding of ENSO.) The instrument temperature records (NODC ocean heat content data and Reynolds OI.v2 satellite-enhanced sea surface temperature data) indicate the oceans warmed as a result of naturally occurring processes, not in response to manmade greenhouse gases. Again, if this topic is new to you, please refer to the essay “The Manmade Global Warming Challenge” (42MB).
In later interviews and articles, Dr. Trenberth has confirmed that El Niño events do cause the upward steps in global surface temperatures. See Trenberth’sAugust 2013 interview on NPR . His mention of 1998 is, of course, a reference to the response of global surface temperatures to the 1997/98 El Nino. Trenberth stated (my boldface):
The oceans can at times soak up a lot of heat. Some goes into the deep oceans where it can stay for centuries. But heat absorbed closer to the surface can easily flow back into the air. That happened in 1998, which made it one of the hottest years on record.
Trenberth says since then, the ocean has mostly been back in one of its soaking-up modes.
“They probably can’t go on much for much longer than maybe 20 years, and what happens at the end of these hiatus periods, is suddenly there’s a big jump [in temperature] up to a whole new level and you never go back to that previous level again,” he says.
You can think of it like a staircase. Temperature is flat when a natural cool spell cancels out the gradual temperature increase caused by human activity. But when there’s a natural warm spell on top of the long-term warming trend, the story is dramatically different.
In summary of this section: At the beginning of it, I noted it has been well known for decades that global surface temperatures warm in response to El Niño events and cool in response to La Niñas. But only a few portions of the surface of the global oceans respond, warming and cooling, proportionally to El Niño and La Niña events. And that’s important. The eastern Pacific Ocean from pole to pole and from the dateline to Panama is one of them. The East Pacific (90S-90N, 180-80W) covers about 33% of the surface of the global oceans (about 24% of the surface of the globe), so it’s not a small area. While it responds proportionally to El Niño and La Niña events, the surface of the East Pacific shows little to no warming over the past 32+ years, which is the satellite era of sea surface temperature data. Refer to the graph here from the March 2014 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Update. And the sea surface temperature anomalies of the East Pacific serve as a reasonable indicator of the timing, magnitude and duration of El Niño and La Niña events. So I’ve compared the sea surface temperature anomalies of the East Pacific to those of the rest of the world (Atlantic-Indian-West Pacific, also from pole to pole) in Figure 13. Note the step-like response of the sea surface temperatures of the Atlantic, Indian and West Pacific Oceans in response to the 1986/87/88 and 1997/98 El Niño events. Those are what cause Trenberth’s “big jumps” in global surface temperatures. It’s blatantly obvious that the sea surface temperatures of the Atlantic, Indian and West Pacific Oceans are not cooling proportionally to the La Niña events that follow the 1986/87/88 and 1997/98 El Niños. Refer also to the color-coded graph of the sea surface temperature anomalies of the Atlantic, Indian and West Pacific Oceans here from the March 2014 Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Update.

Figure 13
And if you haven’t yet read the post and essay linked earlier in this section, here’s a relatively brief explanation of what causes those step-like shifts in the sea surface temperatures of the Atlantic, Indian and West Pacific Oceans. An El Niño releases a vast amount of warm water from below the surface of the West Pacific Warm Pool. (Important thing to consider: When the warm water was below the surface of the west Pacific Warm Pool it was not included in the surface temperature record. During and after the El Niño, the warm water is included. The result: A quick, naturally caused rise in global surface temperatures.) That warm water floods into the East Pacific, where it temporarily raises the sea surface temperatures. See the spike in 1997/98 in Figure 13 in response to the 1997/98 El Nino. After the El Niño, the trade winds push all of the left over warm surface water back to the western tropical Pacific, where it is distributed poleward and into the eastern Indian Ocean. There is also a phenomenon called a slow-moving Rossby wave that returns warm subsurface water (left over from the El Niño) back to the western extratropical Pacific. (The slow-moving Rossby wave is visible in the animation here, at about 10N in the tropical Pacific, after the 1997/98 El Niño.) That subsurface warm water left over from the El Niño is redistributed around the globe, where it eventually rises to the surface, and it is also fed back to the equatorial Pacific to serve as fuel for secondary weaker central Pacific El Niños, like those that occurred in 2002/03, 2004/05, and possibly 2006/07. The leftover warm water accumulates in regions of the western extratropical Pacific, areas known as the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), where sea surface temperatures rise drastically during the La Niñas that trail the strong El Niños. Those leftover warm waters counteract the La Niña taking place in the tropical Pacific and prevent surface temperatures around the globe from responding fully to the La Niña.
CLOSING
There is much more to El Niño event than a simple warming of the eastern tropical Pacific. They have strong impacts on weather around the globe. A strong El Niño event can also cause an upward shift in the temperatures of two-thirds of the surface of the global oceans, while having no apparent long-term effect on the other one-third. Those upward shifts in surface temperatures give the appearance of a relatively steady rise in global surface temperatures when the data are looked at globally. As a result, the rise in global surface temperatures have been incorrectly attributed to human-induced global warming. That means the climate science community is no closer to finding evidence of the human fingerprint in global warming than they were in the early 1990s, the early years of the IPCC. The IPCC has no one to blame for that than themselves, with their focus on carbon dioxide.

Via the Stanford University press room: Stanford’s Chris Field has spent five years leading a large team of international scientists as they prepared a major United Nations report on the state and fate of the world’s climate. The hours were long, the company was good and the science is crucial.
By Rob Jordan

In the summer of 2009, Stanford Professor Chris Field embarked on a task of urgent global importance.
Field had been tapped to assemble hundreds of climate scientists to dig through 12,000 scientific papers concerning the current impacts of climate change and its causes.
The team, Working Group II, would ultimately produce a 2,000-page report as part of a massive, three-partU.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, which details a consensus view on the current state and fate of the world’s climate.
 

The job would take nearly five years, spanning time zones and languages, and requiring patient international diplomacy, dogged organizational discipline and a few napkin doodles. Marathon debates conducted over Skype crashed the service more than once.
“It’s got lots of moving pieces, personalities and opportunities for things to go right or wrong,” said Field, who co-chaired the effort. “You end up with a report that reflects the balance of understanding across the scientific community.”
In addition to being a professor of biology and of environmental Earth system science, he heads the Department of Global Ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science, and is a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and the Precourt Institute for Energy.
This team conducted most of the work behind closed doors, but Field and other Stanford faculty members who played key roles shared a behind-the-scenes story of what it takes to generate the most comprehensive diagnosis of the health of the planet and the risks it faces.
Beginning the journey
For Field’s group, the long road began in earnest at a July 2009 meeting in Venice, Italy, where 209 scientific experts and IPCC members from around the world developed a chapter-by-chapter outline of the report. Their outline was later formally accepted at a meeting in Bali, Indonesia.
But before Field and his team could begin the heavy lifting of writing the report, they hosted a kind of American Idol-style search for scientists to serve as authors and editors.
Over several months, they sifted through 1,217 nominations representing 73 countries. Field’s team read every nominee’s resume and consulted with observer organizations and senior climate science leaders on each. “There’s a full diversity of opinions,” Field said, pointing out that some of those selected are outspokenly skeptical of computer climate modeling, for instance.
After participants from all IPCC countries vetted the final selections, the 310 new colleagues – including a number of Stanford researchers – were ready.
Putting the pieces together
Much of the work was done at night or on weekends. Among the authors and editors staying up late were Stanford Woods Institute Senior Fellows Terry Root, a professor, by courtesy, of biology, and David Lobell and Noah Diffenbaugh, both associate professors of environmental Earth system science. “There is no institution as richly represented as Stanford,” Field said.
Stanford even hosted a U.S. government-funded office on campus, with five scientists and four technical staffers. The university also provided library research privileges for IPCC authors from developing countries.
“Stanford didn’t see it as a distraction, but as a fundamental function of the university,” Diffenbaugh said. His 9-year-old daughter, however, had a different perspective. Her father, worn out from after-hours work on the assessment, would often fall asleep while reading bedtime stories.
“There were definitely a lot of late nights,” Diffenbaugh said. “You want to know the answer, and you want to get it right. In that sense, it’s not a punch-the-clock kind of activity.” Authors were told during orientation that they should expect to devote about 25 percent of their time for three years to the report.
“Overall, it’s a process designed to not let any nonsense through, so that policymakers get only the best of what science can say,” said Lobell, a lead author on a chapter about food production systems and food security. “That takes a lot of checking, rechecking and outside review, which is not always the most exciting, but you do it realizing that it’s part of the process.”
Sometimes, it took pen sketches too. Lobell recalled a group effort to come up with a key summary figure for the chapter he worked on about food security. “We ended up doodling on napkins over dinner, and then I went back and made a version that ended up in the final report. One of the senior authors described that as the highlight of his career.”
Reaching consensus
The journey to the final draft was a delicate exercise in international relations.
“It is a tough job,” said Root, a review editor for a chapter on terrestrial and inland water systems. “You must be very current with the literature, and due to space constraints there are always ‘battles’ to include what each author thinks is important. It is wonderful, though, getting the opportunity to work with the best scientists around the world.”
Root and her fellow chapter editors in Spain and Switzerland would hash out their different perspectives during early-morning conference calls. Their Skype sessions sometimes went for more than four hours.
The chapter teams pored over dozens of peer-reviewed studies, some of them from nonscientific journals, discussed and debated findings, and then settled on language they were all comfortable using. “Instead of telling your fellow scientists they were full of it, you just had to say, ‘Where’s the traceable evidence?’ and they would change their tune,” Lobell said. Still, “there was nearly always a friendly atmosphere.”
“The challenge is also to communicate things clearly,” he added. “For example, it doesn’t help much to say, ‘Things are uncertain.’ It’s better to say something like, ‘If we knew A, we would know B, but we don’t really know A.'”
With consensus on their minds, representatives of IPCC member countries met in Switzerland in late February to review the report’s final draft.
“If the countries don’t agree on particular text, generally the text doesn’t get in there,” Field said. In some cases, representatives from a small group of countries might decamp to a separate room to work out differences of opinion. “For the exceptionally rare cases where every country but one agrees on something, sometimes text will go into the report saying every country but one agrees on this.”
The homestretch and beyond
Leaders in business, national security, public health, agriculture and other fields can make good use of the data, said Michael Mastrandrea, a Stanford Woods Institute consulting assistant professor. “Climate change is not just something for governments to be thinking about.”
Field acknowledged that the report’s continued value depends on making it more accessible and relevant to a wider audience. “There are a number of things I think the IPCC does spectacularly well. There are some things we don’t do so well,” he said. Field would like to see more author participation from the private sector, such as oil companies and reinsurance firms, and more integration of IPCC working groups.
Perhaps most important, Field envisions providing more user-friendly, customizable and interactive electronic data on an ongoing basis, as opposed to one massive report every six or seven years.
The report will serve as a foundation for international negotiations at events such as the U.N. Climate Leaders Summit scheduled for September. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called on world leaders to make “bold” pledges at the meeting and to demonstrate they will achieve ambitious emissions cuts as part of a legal agreement to be signed in early 2015. Field remains optimistic that the report can spur policy and technology that will steer the Earth toward a more sustainable future.
“Even though we face some serious challenges, we have some really attractive opportunities for building a better world in the future,” Field said. “The thing we need to wrap our collective brains around is that building a better world is going to require taking advantage of the scientific knowledge and being smart about managing the risk.”

"LOS ANGELES  —   Now it’s war: Nickelodeon, once again winning the children’s ratings race against Disney Channel, has decided to throw its weight behind . .. a princess. Nickelodeon has always had its share of magical kingdoms, but this   cable network has tended to leave the princess business to Disney. (And what a business it is, generating an estimated $5. 5 billion a year in merchandise revenue alone.) But here comes “Nella the Princess Knight,” which Nickelodeon will introduce on Monday in a programming block for preschoolers. The   Princess Police, mostly academics who use Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and their slender ilk to make  points about their negative impact on young girls, have been a perennial thorn in Disney’s side, even as the company has introduced black and Latina royals, along with a preschool one, “Sofia the First. ” Will Nickelodeon now find itself in a similar position? Maybe not. The   Nella pushes boundaries, at least for television aimed at    in the areas of race and gender. She is biracial, with a black father and a white mother, a decision informed by Nickelodeon research indicating that most children under 12 will be nonwhite by 2020 and that already 17 percent are biracial. The character also mashes together traditional boy and girl gender norms. Nella may ride a unicorn with a pink mane (à la My Little Pony) but she does it while brandishing a sword and wearing knight gear, a bit like a preschool version of Brienne of Tarth from “Game of Thrones. ” She is a girlie girl but does traditional boy activities (battling a dragon) and does not spend the majority of her time in a ball gown. Nickelodeon’s princess may strike some adults as subversive, particularly given the surge of conservatism that helped push Donald J. Trump into office. But children see   families and the blurring of gender lines as normal, said Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon’s longtime chief. “Adults might say, ‘Oh, look  —   she’s biracial,’ but our viewers just say, ‘That looks like my friend,’” she said. “An older generation was taught tolerance, and this audience is demanding difference,” said Ms. Zarghami. She led Nickelodeon to ratings strength in 2016 among total viewers and children ages 2 to 11, even as competitors like Disney Channel and Cartoon Network recorded sharp    drops. (According to Nielsen, Disney still has a big lead among viewers 6 to 14.) She added, “This series seems to be taking on a life of its own, which is incredibly exciting. ”"

Earlier this year, the millennial generation (those born roughly between 1980 and 1997) overtook the baby boomers as the largest generation of Americans alive today. As such, they are poised to have a big impact on the 2016 elections, and the oldest millennials, now 35, are starting to occupy important leadership positions in the private and public sector.



In our recent study, published by the Cato Institute and based on an analysis of a wide range of polling data, we find that millennials share a distinct set of foreign policy attitudes, compared with their elders. They view the world as less threatening, are more supportive of international cooperation and diplomacy, and are far more averse to the use of military force.



Surprisingly, despite the fact that 9/11 is the defining event of their generation, the data suggest millennials see the world as a less dangerous place than their elders. Compared with other generations, millennials are less worried about international terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism.



Millennials grew up after the Cold War, without the specter of nuclear holocaust fueled by a decades‐​long superpower confrontation. Terrorism is dangerous, but it does not fuel the same threat perceptions that the Cold War did for older generations. In addition, many millennials were simply too young for 9/11 to have had the direct emotional impact it did for many older Americans.





Millennials share a distinct set of foreign policy attitudes, compared with their elders.



More broadly, for millennials, the meaning and impact of 9/11 appears to have become entangled with the U.S. response to it. A majority of millennials, like other generations, view the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as a mistake, but millennials are also three times more likely to believe that Obama’s foreign policy is too aggressive and the least likely to believe that using military force is the best way to solve problems.



This is why polls show that millennials are the only generation in which a majority believes that the United States probably did something to provoke 9/11. Millennials don’t view 9/11 as evidence that the world is a dangerous place as much as they see it as evidence that aggressive U.S. military action is counterproductive.



As a result of this discomfort with the war on terror, many millennials have internalized an “Iraq Aversion”—a significant reluctance to support the use of military force abroad.



Others have argued that Americans of all ages have become more cautious in the wake of too many casualties and exorbitant costs for too little gain. But millennials experienced 9/11 and the U.S. response during their “critical period,” when sociologists argue that people form their lifelong attitudes and worldview. So, while the effects of the war will be temporary for older Americans, the Iraq Aversion is likely to be permanent for millennials.



What will millennial foreign policy attitudes mean for 2016 and beyond? Some have worried that the millennials’ preference for military restraint signals a shift toward isolationism, but we believe that instead millennials are adopting their own approach to engaging the world.



Polls consistently show that millennials are the generation most supportive of cooperating on global issues, including working with the United Nations, collaborating on international treaties to deal with issues like climate change, and accommodating the views of allies in the pursuit of U.S. interests.



China serves as a prime example of the millennial view. Millennials are the only generation in which a majority sees China more as a partner than a rival and is far more supportive of cooperation with that nation than confrontation. So in contrast to charges of isolationism, millennials favor cooperative rather than military engagement around the world.



It’s important to note, however, that the millennial generation is not monolithic. Despite their tendency to gravitate toward cooperation and to reject the use of force, millennials remain politically polarized in many of the same ways as their parents, which inhibits agreement on many foreign policy priorities.



Longer term, American millennials will have to find ways to engage constructively with other millennials in the Middle East and around the world, as the latter are becoming increasingly influential in their countries. For global millennials, like those at home, the United States’s war on terror, including military operations in five Middle East nations over the past 15 years, has left an indelible mark on attitudes toward war and foreign affairs.



Given the levels of anti‐​American sentiment generated by U.S. efforts since 9/11 and the turbulence of the Middle East, the millennials are likely to be dealing with the aftermath for a lifetime. How millennials eventually meet that challenge will be a defining element of future U.S. foreign policy.

"**A major agreement governing the transfer of EU citizens' data to the United States has been struck down by the European Court of Justice (ECJ).**
The EU-US Privacy Shield let companies sign up to higher privacy standards, before transferring data to the US.
But a privacy advocate challenged the agreement, arguing that US national security laws did not protect EU citizens from government snooping.
Max Schrems, the Austrian behind the case, called it a win for privacy.
""It is clear that the US will have to seriously change their surveillance laws, if US companies want to continue to play a role in the EU market,"" he said.
US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said his department was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision.
He said he hoped to ""limit the negative consequences"" to transatlantic trade worth $7.1 trillion (Â£5.6tn).
The EU-US Privacy Shield system ""underpins transatlantic digital trade"" for more than 5,300 companies. About 65% of them are small-medium enterprises (SMEs) or start-ups, according to University College London's European Institute.
Affected companies will now have to sign ""standard contractual clauses"": non-negotiable legal contracts drawn up by Europe, which are used in other countries besides the US.
They are already used by many big players. Microsoft, for example, has issued a statement saying it already uses them and is unaffected.
The last time a major deal like this was struck down in 2015 - also from a case involving Max Schrems \- a grace period was brought in as companies figured out what to do.
Mr Schrems had also challenged the validity of the SCCs, but the ECJ chose not to abolish them.
But it did warn that those contracts should be suspended by data protection watchdogs, if the guarantees in them are not upheld.
Mr Schrems' case was partly prompted by leaks from ex-CIA contractor Edward Snowden which revealed the extent of US surveillance.
European data protection law says data can only be transferred out of the EU - to the United States or elsewhere - if appropriate safeguards are in place.
But the ECJ said US ""surveillance programmes... are not limited to what is strictly necessary"".
""The requirements of US national security, public interest and law enforcement have primacy, thus condoning interference with the fundamental rights of persons whose data are transferred,"" it said.
""The limitations on the protection of personal data arising from the domestic law of the United States... are not circumscribed in a way that satisfies requirements.""
""This is a bold move by Europe,"" Jonathan Kewley, co-head of technology at law firm Clifford Chance, said.
""What we are seeing here looks suspiciously like a privacy trade war, where Europe is saying their data standards can be trusted but those in the US cannot.""
He also warned that standard contractual clauses (SCCs) will be much more closely scrutinised from now on.
Data protection expert Tim Turner agreed, saying the ECJ's warning over the standard clauses could spell further trouble for US companies.
""If the law in the relevant country - let's say the USA - could override what the contract says, they don't work,"" he said.
""I don't know how much appetite they have to do this, but it's hard to imagine that any European regulator would say that SCCs work for the US, and the pressure will pile on for them to make the assessment.
""I don't think SCCs escaped the court's judgement - for some key countries, it's probably just a stay of execution."""
"LONDON  —   The European Union is accustomed to crises. But it is probably safe to say that none of the 28 leaders who are gathering in Malta on Friday expected the crisis that has overtaken the agenda: the United States of America. Like much of the world, the European Union is struggling to decipher a President Trump who seems every day to be picking a new fight with a new nation, whether friend or foe. Hopes among European leaders that Mr. Trump’s bombastic tone as a candidate would somehow smooth into a more temperate one as commander in chief are dissipating, replaced by a mounting sense of anxiety and puzzlement over how to proceed. If many foreign leaders expected a Trump administration to push to renegotiate trade deals, or take a tough line on immigration, few anticipated that he would become an equal opportunity offender. He has insulted or humiliated Mexico, Britain, Germany and Iraq engaged in a war of words with China and Iran and turned a routine phone call with the prime minister of Australia, a staunch ally, into a minor diplomatic crisis. With the possible exception of NATO, where he has softened his tone, Mr. Trump has expressed disdain for other multilateral institutions such as the European Union. His praise has been reserved for populists and strongmen, like Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U. K. Independence Party, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and, of course, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Trump is convinced that the United States has been played for a patsy by the rest of the world and is vowing to set things straight. “We’re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually,” he said on Thursday at a prayer breakfast. “It’s not going to happen anymore. ” Against this forbidding backdrop, some European leaders are urging their counterparts to recognize that Mr. Trump may represent a truly dire challenge, one that threatens to upend not only the   European project of integration and security, but just about everything they stand for, including liberal democracy itself. A European official, Donald Tusk, created a stir this week when he wrote a letter to 27 leaders of the bloc’s 28 member states suggesting that the Trump administration presented a threat on a par with a newly assertive China, an aggressive Russia and “wars, terror and anarchy in the Middle East and Africa. ” Intentionally, he left out Britain, because it has voted to leave the bloc and its prime minister, Theresa May, has rushed with what some Europeans consider unseemly rapidity to the side of Mr. Trump, who has derided the European Union and praised Britain’s withdrawal, or “Brexit,” saying, “I don’t think it matters much for the United States. ” In his letter, Mr. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who is the president of the European Council, made up of the national leaders, wrote of “worrying declarations” from the Trump team, adding: “Particularly the change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation, with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy. ” Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian ambassador working in Brussels, said that Mr. Tusk “is prone to exaggeration” and that he had a specific Polish fear of Mr. Trump’s apparent coziness with Mr. Putin. But Mr. Tusk “has some justification,” Mr. Stefanini said, because he is also reacting to a complacent Brussels establishment “that he believes is shrugging off Brexit, Trump and   populism and believes it’s business as usual. ” Others say Mr. Tusk is adapting realistically to a series of new dangers posed by the new administration in Washington. Mr. Trump’s open protectionism, his contempt for the European Union and his ambivalence toward NATO are serious and damaging, which Mr. Tusk understands, said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Trump is the first American president since the E. U. was created not to be in favor of deeper European integration,” Mr. Leonard said. “Not only that, but he’s against it and sees the destruction of the European Union as in America’s interest. ” Worse, he said: “Europeans see Trump as the biggest threat to global order and the European ideal of how the world should be organized. The U. S. has been a crucial part of the ballast meant to be upholding the global order in the face of these other challenges Tusk mentions, from Russia and China to Islamic radicalism. ” “But rather than acting as a check on these forces, Trump seems to be amplifying them, and that’s pretty terrifying,” Mr. Leonard continued. “It’s like you suddenly discover that the medicine you’ve been taking is making you sicker than the illness itself. ” For his part, Mr. Trump described his confrontational diplomatic style as a necessity. “The world is in trouble, but we’re going to straighten it out, O. K.?” he said at the prayer breakfast on Thursday. “That’s what I do  —   I fix things. ” He added: “Believe me, when you hear about the tough phone calls I’m having, don’t worry about it. Just don’t worry about it. ” There have been other moments when Europeans judged American policies as harmful, including the Iraq war and the assaults on multilateralism early in the first term of President George W. Bush. “But Trump’s attacks are of a different scale and come when there’s a lot of indigenous turmoil anyway,” Mr. Leonard said. “He seems to be linking up with some of the scariest and darkest forces within European societies,” which all want the European Union to fail, he said. Mr. Trump’s views about Europe and his reluctance to commit to summit meetings with the European Union or even with NATO are deeply troubling for Europeans, said Leslie Vinjamuri, a professor of international relations at London’s School of Oriental and African Studies. “America’s strategy towards Europe has always been highly consequential, but up until now that strategy has been aimed at bolstering Europe,” she said. The United States has provided “that overarching protection and alliance that underpins the whole thing and makes it work,” she said. “But dealing with Russia and China is suddenly a whole different calculus if you don’t have America behind you. ” Then there is Germany and the euro. Traditionally, Europeans view Germany as the bulwark of the European Union, its largest, richest and most influential country, but uncomfortable with open leadership. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, up for   this autumn, is viewed as practical, pragmatic and devoted to the European project, and Germans see the euro as a political sacrifice they made of the revered deutsche mark to please the French. So they deeply resent Mr. Trump’s attacks on Ms. Merkel for her refugee policy and his statements that the European Union itself is a “vehicle” for German  . Ms. Merkel was angry over comments by Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump’s new National Trade Council, that Germany was manipulating a “grossly undervalued” euro to gain trade advantages over other Europeans and the United States. While Germany depends heavily on exports, annoying some of its neighbors, the value of the euro is the same for all that use it, and Ms. Merkel made clear that its value was up to the European Central Bank, not Berlin. But a protectionist America that opposes free trade is certainly unhelpful to Germany. Added to that are the comments by Ted Malloch, who has been advertising himself as Mr. Trump’s top choice to succeed Anthony L. Gardner as ambassador to the European Union. Mr. Malloch, a strong supporter of Britain leaving the bloc, has publicly said that Mr. Trump “doesn’t like an organization that is supranational, that is unelected, where the bureaucrats run amok, and is not frankly a proper democracy. ” Mr. Malloch has also referred to   Juncker, the European Commission president, as “a very adequate mayor of some city in Luxembourg,” predicted that the euro would collapse and compared the bloc to the Soviet Union. “I had in a previous career a diplomatic post where I helped bring down the Soviet Union,” he said on British television. “So maybe there’s another union that needs a little taming. ” Mr. Malloch may not get nominated, and if he does, the bloc may not accept his posting, Mr. Gardner said. Mr. Trump is “getting advice that is a caricature of the E. U. as a dysfunctional entity, not delivering and wholly inaccurate, despite all the challenges,” Mr. Gardner said, citing joint   efforts in counterterrorism, trade, sanctions, security, digital privacy and policing. “Even Mrs. May has said Britain sees a cohesive E. U. in British interests. She doesn’t want to see a disintegrating E. U. on its doorstep and nor do we. Hopefully that will be heard by others in the administration. ” Mr. Tusk, he said, has a point, trying to dissuade other European Union nations, like Hungary and Poland, from rushing to Washington to try to make separate deals, which would be illegal, with the Trump administration. China and Russia, too, have always tried to ignore the European Union and deal bilaterally with member states, something Mr. Trump seems to be encouraging. The French, who are being tough on a British withdrawal and are deeply disconcerted by Mr. Trump, see him as a bigger threat to European cohesion, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform. “They see the three great world powers  —   Russia, China and now the U. S.  —   wanting to destroy the E. U.,” he said. One impact of Mr. Trump that Mr. Tusk is clearly hoping for, Mr. Grant said, is “to reinforce a feeling of solidarity among mainstream European politicians. ” Another result, said François Heisbourg, a senior adviser with the French Foundation for Strategic Research, may be a more serious European effort at forming its own defense capacity, which may not be in the interests of NATO or the United States. The American commitment to NATO and the European Union has been unconditional since their creation, Mr. Heisbourg said. “But Trump sees alliances as transactional, and once you state that, countries like Poland, Hungary and Japan start to hedge their bets. ” But Mr. Heisbourg also notes the impact of Mr. Trump’s dark view of the world as a helpless America being taken to the cleaners by its allies. “In the Trump world there are no sunny uplands, just darkness and hatred,” he said. “And in a continent that has had its share of hatred, this resonates. ”"
"You may think of volcanic eruptions as spectacular but brief explosions. But in reality, these destructive forces wreak havoc before headlines are made and continue long after they fade. As our new research shows, it is the drawn-out nature of volcanic eruptions that can be most fatal – and understanding why is the key to saving lives. Most commonly, volcanoes will emit pulses of gas and solids for six to seven weeks, with quiet fizzling and rumbling punctuated by more intensive bouts of activity. Some go on for years and even decades. The recent fatal explosion in the Italian island of Stromboli is part of an eruptive sequence that officially began in 1934) but stretches back millennia – the Romans referred to the island as the “lighthouse” of the Mediterranean).  But despite this sustained risk, many who live within the reach of volatile volcanoes choose to stay in high hazard zones during an eruption, risking their lives. Studies report that between 15 and 85% of evacuated populations revisit dangerous areas while warnings are still in place. However, research examining why so many choose to do so is limited. To better understand how to protect lives and livelihoods in the wake of eruptions, we investigated the impacts of past eruptions on the communities around volcanoes with a three-pronged approach. Reporting on what happens to entire populations during eruptions can be a bit patchy, but what is usually well covered is when people died and where and what they were doing. We examined the circumstances of human deaths from all eruptions globally with available data over a 30-year period. We also conducted detailed interviews with people who had experienced prolonged volcanic activity in Latin America and the Caribbean. Finally, we compiled and analysed existing case studies of communities affected by recent eruptions, to understand the relevant data they had uncovered. Data on deaths showed that where warnings were in place, about 75% of the fatalities happened inside a zone where people had been asked to to leave, or stay away from. More than 90% of these were people who were either protecting their assets or engaged in activities that contributed to their livelihoods – farming for instance. More than 70% of all fatalities happened a week or more after the initial eruption, despite warnings being in place. Interviews gave us more insight into the pressures that might have led to those risky decisions. Most people who chose to return to evacuation zones were aware of the risks, but pressures to protect livelihoods and well-being override those considerations. Many returned to look after property, animals or crops. Some people simply wanted to protect and be with their community and seek solace in their home. Few just returned out of curiosity. Difficult conditions in evacuation shelters also contribute. After the Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat began to erupt in 1995, some people lived for months in refuges where supplies of fresh vegetables were in short supply. By 1997, some were returning to the evacuated zone to tend to crops in an attempt to provide for not only their families but others too. In June of that year, 19 people died during an upsurge in activity in the exclusion zone. What ours and and the other studies we analysed show is that promoting awareness of the sustained risks of volcanoes is a good start, but it’s not enough to ensure people’s safety. Evacuation strategies also need to find ways of minimising long-term impacts on livelihoods and well-being – especially when they last for more than a few days. For example, authorities could provide alternative pasture for animals, or ensure market prices don’t fall if they have to sell them. Allowing populations at risk to anticipate sudden changes in activity would also be helpful. The better we can forecast sudden upsurges in activity, the less disruption there will be to affected populations. Scientists are hopeful that new technologies such as drones, space-based monitoring and better micro-analyis of erupted rocks will soon allow us to better detect when unrest turns to more violent eruptions and, just as importantly, when a volcano will settle for a longer period of time. Improving communication networks in at-risk areas is also crucial for improved forecasting to be useful. Of course, most important of all is that strategies are designed by working collaboratively with and for communities at risk. There are already some wonderful examples where scientists, authorities and communities collaborate to share and rapidly transmit information when activity changes. For example, at Tungurahua in Ecuador, “watchers” have direct radio contact with the local observatory and are trusted members of their community. This network enabled populations to respond rapidly when the volcano started generating pyroclastic flows between 2006 and 2014.  All of this applies not just to volcanoes, but other protracted hazards such as flooding, coastal erosion and landslides too – many of which we will face with increased frequency in the future. By truly understanding and addressing what drives people to return to dangerous zones, and helping them anticipate times of extreme risk, we can save countless lives and countless more livelihoods."

It’s a measure of how low the once-great Labor party have sunk that they’ve spent no doubt a massive consultant’s fee for two has-been politicians to tell them what any punter in the street could have told them for free. The only difference is that ~~Weatherill and Emerson~~ Sherlock and Obvious used somewhat politer language than the average punter would.



Still, Sherlock and Obvious get to pocket a handsome fee for coming to the stunning conclusion that Labor lost the May election because their policies sucked and Bill Shorten is a creep. Oh – and the party has abandoned its traditional constituency in order to chase the votes of a tiny clique of inner-city trendoids.



Labor’s campaign review has declared “Bill Shorten’s unpopularity contributed to the election loss” and he failed to formulate a narrative that unified the party’s policies.



The review finding […] say Labor “did not settle on a persuasive strategy for winning the election”.



The findings say the negative gearing and franking credits policies exposed Labor to attacks from the Coalition and the party had “no clear voter-choice message”.



The policies only exposed Labor to attacks because the policies were so diabolical. Voters had a clear choice, all right – just not the one Labor wanted.



Even worse for Labor, formerly rusted-on workers have rejected the “party of the workers” in droves.



The review outlines how its traditional base turned against the party […]“Outer-metropolitan, provincial and rural Australia swung against Labor while inner-metropolitan areas swung to Labor.



“Economically insecure, low income voters in outer-urban and regional Australia swung against Labor.”



Christians and Chinese-Australians also swung against Labor. Tertiary-educated and higher-income Australians “swung strongly to Labor”.



The pattern is clear: Labor is now the party of the elites: the rich, university-educated in the inner-cities. Gough Whitlam won back Catholic voters long-estranged by the 1950s. But Christian voters, alarmed by the constant attacks on their freedoms from the left, and Labor’s infatuation with “queer” activism, are walking away from Labor again. Labor can’t even rely on the “wog vote” any more.



But, even if they have identified **where** it’s gone pear-shaped for Labor, Sherlock and Obvious still can’t bring themselves to admit **why**. Instead of admitting that their policies were crap, Labor are insisting that voters were just too stupid to realise how wonderful they were.



Attempting to explain the swings, the review authors blamed it on the “complexity and frequency of Labor’s policy announcements”, which crowded out policies and made it “difficult for local campaigns”.



It also turns out that banking on the nosey-nannas and dreadlocked unemployables of green activism is not a winning strategy.



“Labor’s climate change policy won the party votes among young and affluent older voters in urban areas” […] associating Labor with the Greens in voters’ minds also had a negative impact on Labor’s disastrous results in regional electorates and “devastated its support in the coal mining communities of regional Queensland and the Hunter Valley”.



But Labor’s blindness to its own unelectability goes right to the top.



Bill Shorten has declared political attacks by Clive Palmer and the Liberal Party “successfully tarnished my public standing” […]the review did not consider the merits of the policies the party took to the election.



You just keep telling yourself that, Bill.

"Greta Thunberg and some of the world’s leading climate scientists have written to EU leaders demanding they act immediately to avoid the worst impacts of the unfolding climate and ecological emergency. The letter, which is being sent before a European council meeting starting on Friday, says the Covid-19 pandemic has shown that most leaders are able to act swiftly and decisively, but the same urgency had been missing in politicians’ response to the climate crisis. “It is now clearer than ever that the climate crisis has never once been treated as a crisis, neither from the politicians, media, business nor finance. And the longer we keep pretending that we are on a reliable path to lower emissions and that the actions required to avoid a climate disaster are available within today’s system … the more precious time we will lose,” it says. The EU unveiled its green new deal proposal this year, aiming to transform the bloc from a high to a low-carbon economy without reducing prosperity and while improving people’s quality of life, through cleaner air and water, better health and a thriving natural world. But the authors of the letter dismiss its target of net zero emissions by 2050 as dangerously unambitious. “Net zero emissions by 2050 for the EU – as well as for other financially fortunate parts of the world – equals surrender,” they say. They add that the target is based on a carbon budget that gives only a 50% chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the figure set out in the 2015 Paris agreement. “That is just a statistical flip of a coin, which doesn’t even include some of the key factors such as the global aspect of equity, most tipping points and feedback loops, as well as already built in additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution. So in reality it is much less than a 50% chance.” The letter also argues that the climate and ecological emergency can only be addressed by tackling the underlying “social and racial injustices and oppression that have laid the foundations of our modern world”. It says the EU, with its political and economic clout, has a moral obligation to lead the fight to create a fair and more sustainable world. “We understand and know very well that the world is complicated and that what we are asking for may not be easy. The changes necessary to safeguard humanity may seem very unrealistic. But it is much more unrealistic to believe that our society would be able to survive the global heating we’re heading for, as well as other disastrous ecological consequences of today’s business as usual.” Thunberg and the other signatories – including the scientists Michael Mann and Johan Rockström – call on EU leaders to immediately halt all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction and end subsidies. They say the EU must advocate to make ecocide an international crime and establish annual, binding carbon budgets."
"In cities the world over, men (and, to a lesser extent, women) who urinate in the street  —   al fresco  —   are a scourge of urban life, costing millions of dollars for cleaning and the repair of damage to public infrastructure. And, oh, the stench. Now, Paris has a new weapon against what the French call “les pipis sauvages” or “wild peeing”: a sleek and   public toilet. Befitting the country of Matisse, the urinal looks more like a modernist flower box than a receptacle for human waste. You can even grow flowers in its compost. The Parisian innovation was spurred by a problem of public urination so endemic that City Hall recently proposed dispatching a nearly   “incivility brigade” of   officers to try to prevent bad behavior, which also includes leaving dog waste on the street and littering cigarette butts. Fines for public urination are steep  —   about $75. Even that was not deterrent enough, officials say. A small brigade of sanitation workers still has to scrub about 1, 800 miles of sidewalk each day. And dozens of surfaces are splattered by urine, according to City Hall. Enter the boxy Uritrottoir  —   a combination of the French words for “urinal” and “pavement”  —   which has grabbed headlines and has already been lauded as a “friend of flowers” by Le Figaro, the French newspaper, because it produces compost that can be used for fertilizer. Designed by Faltazi, a   industrial design firm, its top section also doubles as an attractive flower or plant holder. The Uritrottoir, which has   paint and does not use water, works by storing urine on a bed of dry straw, sawdust or wood chips. Monitored remotely by a “urine attendant” who can see on a computer when the toilet is full, the urine and straw is carted away to the outskirts of Paris, where it is turned into compost that can later be used in public gardens or parks. Fabien Esculier, an engineer who is known in the French media as “Monsieur Pipi” because of his expertise on the subject, said the Uritrottoir was more   than the dozens of existing public toilets which dot the capital and are connected to the public sewage system. “Its greatest virtue is that it doesn’t use water, and produces compost that can be used for public gardens and parks,” he said. So far, Paris’s Gare de Lyon, a railway station that has become ground zero in the capital’s war against public urination, has ordered two of the toilets, which were installed on Tuesday outside the station, and the SNCF, France’s   national railway, says it plans to roll out more across the capital if the Uritrottoir is a success. “I am optimistic it will work,” said Maxime Bourette, the SNCF maintenance official who ordered the toilets for the railway. “Everyone is tired of the mess. ” He said it remained to be seen whether the toilets were cost effective  —   he said the SNCF paid about $9, 730 for two, while it would cost about $865 a month to pay a sanitation worker to clean the toilets and take away the waste. A designer of the Uritrottoir, Laurent Lebot, 45, an industrial engineer who has also invented an   vacuum cleaner, said Nantes, in western France, had ordered three for the spring. He had also had inquiries from local councils in Cannes, France Lausanne, Switzerland London and Saarbrücken, Germany. A large model can handle the outflow of 600 people a smaller model absorbs 300 trips to the toilet. “Public urination is a huge problem in France,” Mr. Lebot said. “Beyond the terrible smell, urine degrades lamp posts and telephone poles, damages cars, pollutes the Seine and undermines everyday life of a city. Cleaning up wastes water, and detergents are damaging for the environment. ” France is far from alone in combating public urination. In San Francisco, a street lamp whose base was damaged by urine recently collapsed, almost injuring a driver. The city has since installed public urinals adorned by plants. New York has also long suffered from drunken urinating revelers, but the City Council recently downgraded the offense, along with littering and excessive noise, as part of its effort to divert minor offenders from its already overstretched court system. Nevertheless, offenders face a fine of $350 to $450 if they commit a third offense within a year. In Chester, northwest England, the local government has clamped down on public urination amid concerns it was damaging the city’s medieval covered walkways. In France, the acrid smell of urine has been a particular blight on the nation’s capital stretching back centuries, and Mr. Lebot noted that the carbon of the straw had the added benefit of combating the odor of urine. His next challenge, he added, was to design an aesthetically pleasing public toilet that women could use. Among the steepest fines for an act of public urination  —   about $37, 500  —   was meted out to Pierre Pinoncelli, a French citizen who urinated on the artist Marcel Duchamp’s Dadaist porcelain urinal “Fountain” in 1993  —   considered a masterpiece of conceptual art  —   before hitting it with a hammer. In 2006, he was fined about $230, 000 after he attacked the artwork a second time."

The Edo period in Japanese history ran from 1603-1867. For most of that period, 1639-1854, the nation kept itself deliberately aloof from all Western influence. Japan was closed to foreigners. Meanwhile, the aristocratic samurai class developed an intriguing and elegant method of demonstrating piety in their Shinto temples.
They would carve geometric problems, typically involving circles, on timber shingles, paint them colorfully, inscribe them in kanbun (Chinese characters with diacritical marks to distinguish the Japanese usage), and affix them to the temple walls as an inspiration to subsequent visitors.

The use of kanbun by the samurai was akin to the use of Greek by Roman orators or of Latin by the English aristocracy. The sangaku tablets, therefore, were near-exclusively of samurai origin and were comprehensible to their caste alone, and of course to the delighted deities.
Contemplating the monstrosity of the Navitus Bay wind farm proposal, I was struck by the irregularity of the suggested area for the wind farm (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. The proposed site for the Navitus wind array.
Looking at the shape of the proposed site, it is at once clear that the array is as close to the shore as the developers dare to make it, partly to reduce construction and maintenance costs and partly to minimize the formidable transmission losses in the undersea cable. But the edges of the array are defined more by sight-lines from the shore than by any other consideration.
How would a mathematician go about moving the array further out to sea and compensating for the transmission losses by minimizing the shadowing effect by which turbines take each other’s wind, regardless of the wind direction, as well as minimizing the visual impact?
The prevailing wind is south-westerly, but stretching a line of wind turbines north-west to south-east to capture it would represent an unacceptable hazard to coastal shipping.
One answer is to arrange the turbines in a circle, which provides minimal visual impact. But how to dispose the turbines within the circle to minimize wind shadowing still further?
Fig. 2 shows possible solution for 192 turbines, just two fewer than the Navitus array, and occupying approximately the same area of 68 square miles (the “8” was inadvertently omitted from my recent posting on the array – mea culpa).

Figure 2. An array of 192 wind turbines, each with a 505-ft span and separated from its neighbors by five spans, intended to minimize both visual impact and wind shadow.
Assuming that each turbine’s span is 505 feet, and that turbines must be five spans apart, the diameter of the array is approximately 9 miles 3 furlongs.
Before I reveal what all this has to do with sangaku tablets and their geometric problems based on properties of circles, this method of arranging the wind turbines can also be used to create an ingenious board – the mathematician’s version of the chessboard, if you like – where equal numbers of playing-spaces (let us call them “forts”) guard each straight row (let us call it a “street”), and an equal number of streets meet at each fort.
In the board shown in Fig. 3, there are 44 forts on 77 streets, with exactly four forts guarding each street and exactly seven streets meeting at each fort.

Figure 3. The mathematician’s chessboard
Some 30 years ago I successfully marketed a board game based on a layout similar to this one. The rules I came up with are below this posting. Gentle readers, your challenge – should you choose to accept it – is to devise as many sets of new rules as you can for this board. Then I shall relaunch the game with multiple sets of rules. One board, many games.
The criteria for your rules as follows. The game must be one of pure skill, with no element of chance. It must involve simple pieces placed on the board. The rules must be short, simple and quick to learn, yet the strategy should be complex enough to make the game both exciting for all and intellectually satisfying for good minds. Try out your rules before you send them in. If they’re any good, people will become hooked by the game. That’s how we’ll get the big sales, and you’ll get your royalties.
Now for the connection to the Japanese sangaku tablets. The extraordinary and surprising feature of the layout is that, although the forts are connected by straight streets, it is circles that determine the exact positioning of the nodes coincident with the forts. This is a startling and – as far as I know – hitherto-unsuspected property of circles. The samurai would have appreciated that.

Figure 4. The surprising relation between a network of straight lines and the intersections of a set of circles rotated at equal intervals about a common point on their circumferences.
Below, as promised, are my own rules for the game of Battle. I hope this harmless diversion involving “puzzling things in life” will have given pleasure.

Rules of engagement
The objective is to drive all opposing forces from the battlefield.
The battlefield has 44 forts guarding 77 streets. Four forts guard each street. Seven streets meet at each fort. At the outset, the city is empty of all forces.
Alliances: Blue with Green, Red with Yellow may fight as pairs of allies, or armies may fight singly.
The attack: Each army attacks in turn: Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, etc. Each army’s sortie is in two phases: first, expulsion (wherever possible), then occupation.
Suppose that it is Blue, allied with Green, whose turn is to attack.
1. Expulsion
On every street, street by street, every soldier Blue outnumbers is expelled (at the beginning of the battle, of course, there are no soldiers to expel) –
Ø 2 or 3 Blues on a single street expel 1 Red, Green or Yellow soldier on that street.
Ø 1 Blue stands off against 1 Red, Green or Yellow soldier on the same street.
Ø 2 Blues stands off against 2 Red, Green or Yellow soldiers on the same street. But …
Ø 2 Blues expel 2 soldiers of different colours (e.g. Red & Green) on the same street.
Ø If expulsion exposes soldiers of other colours on cross streets, Blue expels them too.
Ø Blue must expel even outnumbered Green allies on any street (this is friendly fire)
Ø Blue returns all expelled soldiers to their commanders for later re-use.
Some examples:

2. Occupation
When Blue has expelled all possible soldiers, a Blue soldier is stationed at any empty fort, ending the attack. Occupying a fort marks the end of Blue’s sortie.
Victory: An army whose last soldier is expelled retires defeated, though its ally, if there is one, may fight on. The army or alliance that drives all enemy soldiers out of the city wins.
Some hints on basic strategy
Strategy: You will learn the rules of engagement in five minutes. But the strategy, especially with two armies in each of two alliances, is surprisingly complex.
Know the terrain: The battlefield gives equal weight to each fort and each street.
Force deployment is critical. At the beginning, there are no soldiers to expel. Deploy soldiers so as to maximize their power to attack opposing armies, to minimize the risk that they themselves will be attacked, to avoid friendly fire against allied armies, and to command as much of the field as possible.
Attack is the best form of defense. The Rules of Engagement favor aggressive tactics and penalize defensiveness.
Superior force wins. On any street, outnumbered soldiers are expelled.
Choice of position is key. Look for – and eventually learn to create – chances to attack on two or more streets by the deployment of a single well-placed soldier.
Alliances can be made or broken. Armies can fight either as standalone units or as allied forces. With three armies in play, for instance, two armies can form a temporary alliance to target the third. This game can be particularly challenging, as the two trailing forces form temporary alliances to try to fight back against the dominant army.
Unity is strength: On any street, two soldiers of the attacking army defeat and expel two soldiers from different armies, but stand off against two soldiers of one army. This rule reflects the fact that a single, united force is often stronger than divided forces. It also makes the classic game between two Generals each commanding two allied armies a particularly fascinating challenge.
Friendly fire must be avoided if possible. Under the Rules of Engagement, the attacking army must always expel all soldiers from armies that it outnumbers on any street, even if those expelled are from an allied army.
Rout: In Battle, the disastrous knock-on effects of losing one or two vital units in the field are simulated. During an army’s sortie, if it expels a soldier from one street, opposing soldiers on other streets intersecting with the fort previously occupied by the expelled soldier may become outnumbered too. If so, they, too, are expelled before the attacking army stations its soldier at any vacant fort. Beware! A defeat can quickly become a rout.
Attrition: The army or alliance in the lead can pressure its opponents to concede victory at any time.
Blitzkrieg: The game can be played against the clock, with a time limit on each move. Or the whole game can be ended at a fixed time, when the army or alliance with the most soldiers in the field is declared victorious.

"Beach and spa vacations are typically associated with relaxation while urban getaways tend to be all go, go, go, but that doesn’t always have to be the case, according to Michael Bonsor, the hotel manager of Rosewood London. “You can absolutely head to a city for a relaxing vacation,” he said. Here, Mr. Bonsor shares his tips on how to have a   trip in a busy city setting: SET THE MOOD BEFOREHAND Use the journey to your destination as an opportunity to get into vacation mode: If you’re flying, use a pair of   headphones and order a glass of Champagne or another drink you enjoy when you get on board. And watch movies or listen to music on your iPad or on the airline’s   entertainment system. If you’re driving, plan to hit the road when it isn’t rush hour, so you don’t spend hours sitting in traffic have a playlist on hand with your favorite songs and carry indulgent snacks such as a bar of good chocolate. The idea, Mr. Bonsor said, is to start unwinding before your vacation starts. PICK A MANAGEABLE CITY Large cities like New York City, Paris and Tokyo usually don’t lend themselves to relaxation because visitors are often overwhelmed by the number of attractions and can tire themselves out trying to take them all in. Smaller cities such as Vancouver, British Columbia San Miguel de Allende, Mexico and Washington, while still appealing, are more manageable. “You might want to hit a site or two, but there’s not that feeling of sensory overload that comes with larger urban settings,” Mr. Bonsor said. HOTEL LOCATION MATTERS Maximize your getaway by staying in a neighborhood you want to explore  —   you will probably be able to get around by walking or biking and won’t waste time commuting to other parts of town. If you like shopping, choose a property in the city’s main shopping district. If art is of interest, go for a hotel near art museums or galleries. BOOK A SPA TREATMENT UPON ARRIVAL There is nothing like a massage or a spa treatment to help you   and set the tone for a relaxing getaway. In advance of your trip, make an appointment for the day you arrive at your hotel’s spa or one nearby. And if there are particular techniques that the destination is known for, ask for these so you get a greater sense of place. PLAN FOR RELAXATION Give yourself plenty of unscheduled time to decompress by napping or reading by the hotel pool,   at cafes, lingering at wine bars and wandering through the streets soaking up the surroundings. Of course, you should hit tourist sites, but plan to visit them early in the day when they tend to be less crowded."

From the Chalmers University of Technology

Greenhouse gas emissions from food production may threaten the UN climate target of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, according to research at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden.
On Monday 31 March the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) presents their report on the impacts of climate change. 
Carbon dioxide emissions from the energy and transportation sectors currently account for the largest share of climate pollution. However, a study from Chalmers now shows that eliminating these emissions would not guarantee staying below the UN limit. Emissions from agriculture threaten to keep increasing as global meat and dairy consumption increases. If agricultural emissions are not addressed, nitrous oxide from fields and methane from livestock may double by 2070. This alone would make meeting the climate target essentially impossible.
“We have shown that reducing meat and dairy consumption is key to bringing agricultural climate pollution down to safe levels,” says Fredrik Hedenus, one of the study authors. “Broad dietary change can take a long time. We should already be thinking about how we can make our food more climate friendly.”
By 2070, there will be many more of us on this planet. Diets high in meat, milk, cheese, and other food associated with high emissions are expected to become more common. Because agricultural emissions are difficult and expensive to reduce via changes in production methods or technology, these growing numbers of people, eating more meat and dairy, entail increasing amounts of climate pollution from the food sector.
“These emissions can be reduced with efficiency gains in meat and dairy production, as well as with the aid of new technology,” says co-author Stefan Wirsenius. “But the potential reductions from these measures are fairly limited and will probably not suffice to keep us within the climate limit, if meat and dairy consumption continue to grow.”
Beef and lamb account for the largest agricultural emissions, relative to the energy they provide. By 2050, estimates indicate that beef and lamb will account for half of all agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, while only contributing 3 percent of human calorie intake. Cheese and other dairy products will account for about one quarter of total agricultural climate pollution.

A new pharaoh is rising in Egypt. Gen. Abdel Fata al‐​Sisi is preparing to grasp supreme power, most likely as the country’s next president. He is posing as democracy’s savior while his troops are detaining or killing those who oppose him. The arrests and shootings continued during last week’s constitutional referendum.



After some time out of the news, Egypt has reemerged as perhaps the administration’s greatest foreign policy failure. Washington has proved impotent in the face of political revolution, Islamist activism, and military repression. Terrorism is accelerating, and Egypt is likely to end up without stability, liberty, democracy, or prosperity. America should disengage from a crisis which it helped create but has no ability to resolve.



During the Cold War the U.S. stole Cairo away from the Soviet Union and buried the Egyptian government in cash, enriching political and military elites while the population suffered under authoritarian political and dirigiste economic policies. When revolution loomed in 2011 the administration endorsed Hosni Mubarak, before trying to work with newly elected President Mohamed Morsi, of the long repressed Muslim Brotherhood. Whatever his desire, Morsi lacked control of the army, police, judiciary, and bureaucracy, and thus had no opportunity to create an authoritarian Islamic state. He failed to expand his popular appeal and discredited his movement, making the Brotherhood’s defeat almost certain in the next poll.



However, Gen. Sisi and his confederates were in a hurry to seize power. The police faded from the streets, inviting chaos. Business elites created artificial shortages. And the general encouraged demonstrations to justify military intervention. He then staged a coup and cemented his personal control.



Gen. Sisi looked to Joseph Stalin for guidance, initiating a show trial of Morsi. One charge was incitement to murder because the Brotherhood sought to protect the presidential palace from protestors—after the police refused to defend the building. The regime also contended that the former president had insulted the Mubarak‐​dominated judiciary. Last month Morsi was charged with having escaped from prison even as protestors were overthrowing the Mubarak dictatorship. Morsi also was cited for having “opened channels of communication with the West via Turkey and Qatar.”



Morsi’s supporters are paying an even higher price than Morsi as Gen. Sisi’s forces arrest and shoot those who refuse to genuflect to the new pharaoh. Although the Brotherhood was not without blame, the military chose repression over reconciliation. Gen. Sisi killed hundreds or more in the August crackdown in Cairo—probably more than the number killed in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. Since then thousands more have died and been arrested.



The putative pharaoh has been actively restoring the Ancien Regime. Gen. Sisi has tapped military officers as provincial gauleiters, recreated Mubarak’s secret and intelligence police, reinstituted military trials, enacted strict new restrictions on demonstrations, arrested journalists, deployed private thugs against Morsi supporters and regime critics, and prosecuted protestors. McClatchy’s Amina Ismail and Nancy Youssef reported: “Egyptians caught in the roundup have told McClatchy they were tortured while awaiting charges. Islamist leaders claim that the government is rounding up family members in the night as leverage against them. Lawyers tasked with representing arrested Morsi supporters often are arrested when they go to be with their clients during prison interrogations.”



In November 21 women were sentenced to up to 11 years in prison for protesting Morsi’s trial. Seven were under 18 years old. After widespread public outrage, they were freed on appeal. But the same month the “democratic” interim government issued new regulations banning at the regime’s discretion almost any demonstration.





Military rule is about more than politics.



Last month three democracy activists involved in the 2011 revolution were sentenced to three years each in prison for violating the repressive new rules. Ahmed al‐​Maher, one of the three, told his countrymen: “Torture in police stations remains, while the Ministry of Interior is back to what it was. The protest law was passed, and the oppression of freedoms is back. Now the youth of the revolution are in prison.”



On Sunday a prosecutor charged political scientist Amr Hamzawy with insulting the judiciary. In June the latter tweeted a criticism a court ruling against three American non‐​governmental organizations. The military apparently is determined to exterminate any hint of dissent. Samer Shehata of the University of Oklahoma told the _New York Time_ s: “Anyone who would question the current rulers is subject to this kind of persecution.”



The press has been a special military target. Observed the _Washington Post_ : “A once‐​diverse press has swung into line behind the government, parroting its far‐​fetched claims about opponents.” The regime closed four television stations for allegedly sympathizing with the Brotherhood. Comedian Bassem Youssef’s television show was banned after he targeted the general.



Newscaster Shahira Amin, dismissed from her position for “implying” the coup was a coup, told the _Wall Street Journal_ that “now is the worst ever.” She added: “It’s more Mubarak policies, but more dangerous for journalists.” In December the Committee to Protect Journalists said Egypt had become the world’s ninth most prolific jailer of journalists. The Committee on Academic Freedom of the Middle East Studies Association cited a “worsening climate for free speech and peaceable assembly.”



Overall, human rights activists say the situation is worse than under Mubarak. Bahey al‐​Din Hassan, head of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, told the _Journal_ , “It is more horrible than the old regime.” Gamel al‐​Eid of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information argued that the military was sending pro‐​democracy activists a message: “It is time to shut up, to stay quiet. There is only one choice—to support the military or to be in jail.”



Nor does the new constitution matter. The document maintains the military’s privileged status and protects repressive state institutions from outside control. Approval was never in doubt: the regime arrested opponents of the new charter and controlled the vote count.



However, military rule is about more than politics. Today the Egyptian armed forces are an economically exploitative class, managing as much as 40 percent of the economy. Officers operate as a caste, with sons following fathers into service. Robert Springborg of the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School told NPR the officers are collecting “billions and billions and billions” and are “focused on consumption.”



Gen. Sisi has begun to toss unnecessary allies overboard. For instance, when some of the liberal coup supporters began protesting against his policies, the general arrested them. The regime even called them Islamists or terrorists. Coptic Christians were long persecuted by the Mubarak regime and the army, yet Coptic Pope Tawadros II publicly endorsed the coup. It didn’t help. When Islamists retaliated by attacking Copts, the military did little to protect them. Today Gen. Sisi is more interested in appealing to Islamists to draw them away from the Brotherhood.



The regime’s overriding objective is to destroy the group. Cairo has banned the “terrorist” organization and made it a crime to participate in Brotherhood activities or promote the group “by speech, writing or any other means.”



However, the Brotherhood withstood decades of repression by previous dictators and joined the political process strong enough to win Egypt’s first legislative and presidential elections. My Cato Institute colleague Dalibor Rohac warned that past prohibitions—at one point membership was a capital offense—“strengthened the organization’s narrative of victim hood and enabled it to reemerge strengthened and relying on broader popular support.”



Moreover, by confirming the extremist critique that democracy is a fool’s errand, Gen. Sisi has left opponents of his incipient dictatorship little choice but to use violence. Although the organization’s leadership denounced recent bombings, government repression likely will further fragment the leadership and encourage radicalism. Moving to violence “will be small extremist groups and cells, which probably are only now gelling and will be led by organizers who point to Egypt’s history over the past year as demonstrating that the Brotherhood’s commitment to peaceful political competition is foolish and ineffective,” argued former diplomat Paul Pillar.



In fact, Mubarak’s crackdown on the Brotherhood four decades ago sparked the formation of new radical groups, including al‐​Qaeda. Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, both formerly with the State Department, explained: “Repression of Islamists in Egypt was an essential stage in the emergence of contemporary jihadism. As splinter groups that were significantly more radical than the Muslim Brotherhood formed, Islamists became more violent.” The result was radical groups leading up to al‐​Qaeda. Indeed, before joining al‐​Qaeda current leader Ayman al‐​Zawahiri was tortured by the Mubarak regime.



Violent opposition to the Sisi’s incipient dictatorship is rising. Traditionally the security forces faced little resistance. However, more than 150 policemen were killed between August and December. Bombings are increasing in frequency. Worse for America, warned Max Boot: “as long as Washington is seen on the side of the generals, some of their violence will be directed our way.”



Egypt’s stability could be at risk. The London risk consultancy firm Maplecroft warned: “the impact [of violence] this time is likely to be far worse [than in the past], given wider turmoil in the country and the proliferation of weapons.” Even modest unrest and sporadic terrorism would discourage investors and tourists. If Egypt slides toward the sort of civil war which consumed Algeria during the 1990s, the human and economic cost would be incalculable.



However, the Obama administration still refuses to call a coup a coup. It eventually, though reluctantly, withheld portions of the $1.55 billion in annual foreign aid, while assuring Cairo that doing so was not “punitive.” Then the administration pushed to relax aid conditions.



But most of the roughly $75 billion given to Cairo over the years enriched political and military elites and funded the purpose of prestige weapons from American arms makers. The U.S. never received much “leverage” in return. The knowledge that the Egyptian military would cease to exist after a war with Israel kept the peace. Cairo never could afford to close the Suez Canal. The regime could drop preferences currently accorded the Pentagon, but the Egyptian military needs the U.S. more the U.S. needs the Egyptian military. Washington could respond by cutting off spare parts or maintenance contracts.



Anyway, the U.S. had no credibility to enforce conditions since it never was willing to stop the money. The administration finally (kind of) did so last fall, but if America runs back to Cairo, cash‐​in‐​hand, the former will never again have the slightest hint of leverage. Moreover, the regime now is flooded with money from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states and doesn’t need American assistance.



Andrew Cordesman advocated “refocusing U.S. aid to slowly push Egypt’s military toward compromise and restraint, building up Egypt’s more secular and liberal forces, and making it clear that the U.S. supports the role of Egypt’s moderate Islamists.” However, Washington failed to achieve these ends before despite decades of trying. The secular and liberal forces are a political nullity. The military doesn’t need America’s money and won’t let U.S. pressure get in the way of regime preservation.



Sam Holliday of the Armiger Cromwell Center argued that the U.S. should push the Egyptian military “to focus on effective ways to achieve stability within Egypt, rather than relying on suppression tactics and retention of centralized power.” However, military control is based on centralized power and Gen. Sisi has demonstrated no interest in sharing authority. Armiger also suggested that Washington “encourage the Egyptian military to form a coalition with business, the judiciary, young liberals, and those Muslims who oppose the Third Jihad.” But the military doesn’t need them.



Others who support aiding the Egyptian government do so for delusional or even blood‐​thirsty reasons. Rep. Michele Bachmann incongruously blamed the Brotherhood for 9/11. Rep. Louie Gohmert compared blood‐​drenched Gen. Sisi to both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. After the Egyptian military’s slaughter of unarmed men, women, and children, columnist Kurt Schlichter wrote: “I just can’t work up a lot of caring because a pack of murderous subversives whose declared goal is returning the globe to a permanent state of Seventh Century Bedouin theocracy tried to fight it out with a tough, well‐​armed and patriotic Egyptian military and got their teeth kicked in.”



Conservative columnist Lucius Madaurus contended that the Brotherhood, which peacefully participated in Egypt’s _first free elections in history_ , “is a terrorist organization that opposes the idea of Western‐​style democratic government in Egypt.” While endorsing killing by Egypt’s military, he advocated “selling Western ideas of personal liberty and democracy in the Muslim world.” Since the Persian Gulf’s corrupt, repressive, and Islamist monarchies “would prefer a return of dynastic rule in Egypt,” _USA Today_ columnist DeWayne Wickham contended: “The Obama administration and Congress should do the same.”



Jeff Moore of Muir Analytics talked of “massacres,” as if the cold‐​blooded sniping of civilians was not a massacre. He seemed upset that decades ago the Brotherhood tried to assassinate Abdel Gamel al‐​Nasser, a left‐​wing dictator who allied Egypt with the Soviet Union and battled Israel. Moore complained that “Egypt’s domestic war is on, yet again,” but ignored the fact that the military fired first.



Some advocates are more practical. Argued John Bolton, “Today’s struggle is ultimately between the Brotherhood and the army. Like it or not, it is time for the U.S. to choose sides.” The _Journal’s_ Bret Stephens similarly contended that “Politics in Egypt today is a zero‐​sum game: Either the military wins, or the Brotherhood does. If the U.S. wants influence, it needs to hold its nose and take a side.”



Yet for decades Washington has taken sides and gained little benefit. Irrespective of Washington’s financial or rhetorical support, Gen. Sisi is likely to take America’s preferred positions out of his country’s own interest. More important, underwriting a murderous regime inevitably stains the hands of American policymakers. Who can believe Washington’s bleating about human rights any where when it is actively funding a grotesquely repressive regime in Egypt?



The administration should disengage from Egyptian politics. There is no reason to support either side. Explained Charles Dunne of Freedom House: “It is a matter of standing up for American principles and applying them to America’s own foreign policy.”



Washington should stop underwriting repression and killing. The U.S. should demonstrate to Egyptians that it does not believe America’s interests, however defined, warrant wantonly sacrificing their lives, liberty, and dignity. Although Gen. Sisi is widely supported today, his popularity has declined. Growing repression and declining prosperity likely will ultimately make him very unpopular, like Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf. Washington stepping back would send an equally important message to people elsewhere in the world, who see the U.S. repeatedly back corrupt dictators in the name of stability.



Former Reagan official Daniel Oliver declared: “however great the interest of the Egyptian people in their own freedom and human rights, it is eclipsed, even if they don’t realize it, by the national security interest of the United States.” However, promoting U.S. security cannot justify underwriting the slaughter of innocents. And underwriting the slaughter of innocents will ultimately have disastrous consequences for U.S. security.



It’s time for America to exit the Egyptian imbroglio. Washington is far more likely to make the chaos along the Nile worse than better.

One of my farming friends used to say, “Never criticise farming while you’ve got a full belly”. While a bit long on self-righteousness (the same farmer also freely acknowledges that many farmers are prone to whinging and demanding handouts), there is a rock-solid foundation of truth: without agriculture, you don’t have much else. Remember that someone farmed the avocados you have on your hipster cafe smashed avo breakfast en route to the Extinction Rebellion protest.



But what’s even worse is that, for every swivel-eyed vegan storming an [innocent lettuce farm](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/vegan-vegetable-doesnt-know-a-carrot-from-a-cow/), there’s also a taxpayer-funded bureaucrat doing just as much damage.



Most people who work in agriculture scratch their heads in wonderment, perplexed about when and why the western world declared war on food and fibre producers? It seems that at every turn there is a new piece of legislation designed to shut down farming, causing irreparable harm to our national food security. As a sixth-generation primary producer, it can be hard to come to grips with a nation that seems to be intent on imploding. As any thinking person can tell you, without a robust agricultural sector, we are only a hair’s breadth away from being a third-world nation.



As was recently revealed, the vegan activist behind the rash of farm raids in Australia is enthusiastically backed by his mother – [who just happens to be a high-level agriculture bureaucrat](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/vegan-activist-targets-farms-except-the-ones-his-family-own/) in the Federal public service. Well-fed, inner-city green politicians relentlessly campaign against the agriculture industry.



At every turn, the politicians and bureaucrats seem to be working together with the UN to bring about a globalist agenda, rather than look for the national good. The climate cult is causing a mass shift of the wealth and resources to the global elite.



Michael Crichton’s _Climate of Fear_ put forward the case that a culture of fear is being deliberately inculcated in order to manipulate the gullible West. Simon Briscoe’s non-fiction _Panicology_ detailed this very cult of fear being used to derail every endeavour, from medicine, to science, to politics.



Vast numbers of people […] are governed by the agenda of fear. They now march in the street screaming about bringing in total renewable energy by 2030 otherwise we are completely doomed […]Sadly, they don’t realise that they are dooming themselves if [their agenda] is enacted. There will be very few jobs, electricity will be unaffordable, and people will be reduced to extreme poverty. These very same people also have a belief system that has been fed to them over the past decades, that agriculture is cruel, and the farmers are just plain greedy, and need to be closely monitored, as they can’t be trusted with land or animals.



Governments fall over themselves to enact legislation that is in line with the hysteria of this generation.



While the terror-like campaign of farm invasions is obvious, the most insidious weapon being wielded against agriculture is bureaucracy. Water management in Australia has become a bureaucratic nightmare, exacerbating the current drought ten-fold. Farmers whose properties are turning into dust-bowls are forced to watch millions of litres of water go by in “environmental flows”.



Take, for instance, the legislation that has been recently passed by the Queensland State Government regarding the Great Barrier Reef. This legislation has used “erroneous” science to cripple agriculture along the coast of Queensland, extending inland many hundreds of kilometres to “save the reef”.



Despite the evidence that the “science” used to justify this legislation is deeply suspect, farmers are threatened with massive fines and criminal convictions for such things as allowing leaves, bark or animal manure to enter creeks and rivers. Likewise, if they are caught feeding their animals the natural fodder, mulga tree, during drought.



It doesn’t seem too paranoid, any more, to see this war on agriculture as marching in lockstep with the culture of fear. It’s all about control.



Control of the food production and the water equals control of the nation’s future.

"There is a one-in-five chance annual global temperatures will be at least 1.5C warmer than in pre-industrial times in the next five years, experts have said. Annual global temperatures are likely to be at least 1C above the levels they were before the industrial era in each year between 2020 and 2024, a long-range forecast by experts led by the UK Met Office shows.  And there is a 20% likelihood that annual temperatures will exceed 1.5C above pre-industrial levels in at least one year, with the chances increasing over time, according to the analysis published by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). Under the global Paris agreement countries have committed to keep temperature rises “well below” 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to curb them to 1.5C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. While experts say a single year exceeding 1.5C does not mean the targets have been breached, it shows how close to that level the world already is. The forecast marks a new international collaboration coordinated by the WMO and led by the Met Office, drawing on analyses from climate prediction centres in the UK and nine other countries including Australia, the US and China. The climate forecast also predicts there will be enhanced warming of the Arctic, compared to other regions of the world, and there will be an increased risk of storminess across the Atlantic Ocean. It also says that this year, many parts of South America, southern Africa and Australia are likely to be dryer than the recent past. The Earth’s average temperature is already more than 1C over the pre-industrial era, and the last five-year period has been the warmest five years on record. WMO secretary-general Petteri Taalas said: “This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris agreement on climate change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C.” The world may have warmed by about 1C (1.8F) over the past century but the Arctic far outstrips this global average and is warming at about twice the rate of the rest of the world. In places, the rate of warming has been astonishing. Novembers in the Alaskan town of Utqiaġvik, formerly Barrow, are now 5.5C warmer than they were in 1979. In the summer of 2019, an Arctic heatwave had parts of Greenland reach temperatures 40C hotter than normal. The Arctic is dominated by sea ice, unlike the Antarctic, which is essentially a huge land-based ice sheet. As the ocean and atmosphere warm, sea ice is shrinking in extent, at about 13% a decade since 1979, according to Nasa. The bright white surface of ice, known as albedo, is giving way to the dark ocean, meaning that sunlight is being absorbed rather than reflected, amplifying the warming effect. These rapid and unprecedented changes are transforming the Arctic and threatening traditional ways of life, according to US government scientists in a 2019 report card. The sea ice is younger, thinner, more fragile and less extensive, making hunting on the ice harder and more perilous. The marine ecosystem is shifting as warmer water forces fish species to retreat to more northern waters. What is a significant challenge to communities in the Arctic, is a boon to the shipping industry, which can navigate the area more easily. This task will become even simpler once the Arctic is ice-free in summertimes, forecast as soon as the 2040s. The assessment takes into account natural variations as well as human influence on the climate to forecast temperature, rainfall and wind patterns over the next five years. But it does not take into account changes to greenhouse gas emissions and aerosol pollution as a result of coronavirus lockdowns around the world. Prof Taalas said the WMO had “repeatedly stressed” that the industrial and economic slowdown from Covid-19 was not a substitute for sustained and co-ordinated climate action. Due to the long lifetime of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, this year’s emissions drop would not lead to a reduction in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. He said: “Whilst Covid-19 has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human wellbeing, ecosystems and economies for centuries. “Governments should use the opportunity to embrace climate action as part of recovery programmes and ensure that we grow back better.” Climate spokesman for the Met Office Grahame Madge said temporarily exceeding 1.5C in one year did not mean the Paris targets were breached. “But what it does show is how close 1.5C is to where we are at the moment,” he said."
"Protests continue unabated in Venezuela over inequality and abuses of power, with even the anniversary of Hugo Chavez’s death unable to restore calm to the country. Despite sitting on the world’s largest oil reserves, many of Venezuela’s citizens struggle to afford basic goods. Indeed, Venezuela has a long history with commodity boom-and-bust cycles and the inequalities and unrest they produce.  And by long history, I don’t mean since the 1920s, when Venezuela’s oil boom began. I mean since the 1520s when the promise of pearls wrested from coastal oyster beds transformed the region’s economy. It is hard not to marvel at how the exploitation of natural resources has shaped this country’s history, and to ponder the economic and social costs of these periodic bonanzas. In the early sixteenth century, as today, Venezuela’s future hinged on the promise of a particular commodity and the problems associated with its exploitation. It was pearls, not oil or precious metals that first drew Spanish attention to this section of the South American coastline. Treasure hunters initially traded for pearls with indigenous residents of the coast and adjacent islands of Margarita and Cubagua.  When relations with the locals soured, Spaniards cast their net wider, enslaving people from the Bahamas to Brazil. In pursuit of profits, the colonial elite forced thousands of divers into a brutal labour regime in search of the jewel. The patterns of natural and human resource exploitation established in the Venezuelan pearl fisheries long outlasted the profits they produced. As the desire for pearls prompted a forced diaspora of labourers from the Caribbean to the West African coast, it also brought shifts in political and economic capital within Europe. Then as today, the promise of this natural resource brought important foreign investment to Venezuela. The Spanish crown granted the German banking family, the Welsers, administration of the colony in return for financial and political support. But even at the height of the pearl boom there were naysayers, people who observed the high costs of this extractive regime. Some residents of the Pearl Coast (as the region came to be called) lamented the effects of such intensive harvesting on the region’s ecology and sought protective measures for the oyster banks. Other observers focused on the human costs of the pearl industry. Dominican friar Bartolomé de Las Casas, the famed defender of America’s indigenous peoples, condemned prevailing practices, claiming that the horrors of pearl diving exceeded those of labouring in the silver mines on the American mainland. The dangers of pearl diving were considerable: exploding eardrums, shark attacks, a punishing whip for divers who moved too slowly or failed to deliver the right numbers of oysters to the boat. The greed of Spanish investors led to over-fishing, with enslaved divers harvesting young and mature oysters willy-nilly, tearing up the seabed that nourished them in the process. In the frenzied atmosphere, the corpses of slaves who drowned or died while in the water were often left there, the lifeless bodies drawing sharks to the vicinity and further endangering the surviving divers. Today’s oil refineries do not rely on similar labour regimes. Profits are greater and less easily shared than those created in the pearl fisheries. Pearls, unlike petroleum, do not need to be refined in order to render profit. Pearls’ immediate perfection and accessibility gave those who strived to retrieve them a small but important degree of power. The divers at the heart of this industry would secret away the best specimens for themselves and relinquish the pearls to their putative  masters only in return for highly-desired goods, such as playing cards, wine and clothes. Slippery, small pearls constantly evaded monopoly control. It is worth recalling how this long-ago maritime boom ended: in the exhaustion of a natural resource; in the creation of a labour regime and social order that undermined monopoly control; in the formation of a regional economy where pearls abounded and all else was scarce. Reflection on the enduring costs of extractive economies is not new in Venezuela, where the influence of the country’s early pearl boom on a national culture of exploitation has long been a matter of public and literary reflection. But in Venezuela as elsewhere throughout the Americas, colonial legacies of violence and inequality continue to defy resolution. It is sobering to remember how long and tortured a history the country has with the natural wealth that sustains and warps its present as it did its past."
"Sixty per cent of studied fish species will be unable to survive in their current ranges by 2100 if climate warming reaches a worst-case scenario of 4-5C (7.2-9F) above pre-industrial temperatures, researchers have found. In a study of nearly 700 fresh and saltwater fish species, researchers examined how warming water temperatures lower water oxygen levels, putting embryos and pregnant fish at risk.  “A 1.5C increase is already a challenge to some, and if we let global warming persist, it can get much worse,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, a climatologist who co-authored the study published in the journal Science. The world is already more than 1C hotter than before industrialization, and it is on track to be about 3C hotter. In the best-case scenario the authors considered – where the climate heats a total of 1.5C – only 10% of the surveyed species would be at risk in the next 80 years. That scenario still puts fish which are also economically and ecologically important at risk, including Atlantic cod, swordfish, Pacific salmon, Alaska pollock and Pacific cod, which is used to produce frozen fish sticks. Study co-author Flemming Dahlke said it was challenging to assess the impact of a 10% loss in species because a single species can be critical to the overall ecosystem. “Consider the North Sea, where we will expect to see by the end of the century that the temperature will get too high for Atlantic cod to reproduce in that area. If this one species is pushed out of the system, this has a large impact on the ecosystem itself and all the processes and interactions with species because it’s an important predator,” Dahlke said. The study specifically considered how vulnerable to temperature changes different species are in early life stages. As temperatures increase, fish use more energy and require more oxygen. But with the heat, there is less oxygen available. Those circumstances are particularly hard on embryos – which cannot regulate their oxygen levels well – and spawning fish, which need extra oxygen to produce offspring. Some fish species are more adaptable. Ocean species can move to cooler areas, if they are available. But freshwater fish are geographically constrained by their river or lake. Dahlke noted this assessment was conservative – it does not take into account other climate crisis factors that could affect marine life, like ocean acidification, that could amplify the effects on sensitive populations. “Some tropical fish are already living in zones at their uppermost tolerance, their areas are already 40C,” Pörtner said. “Humankind is pushing the planet outside of a comfortable temperature range and we are starting to lose suitable habitat. It’s worth investing in the 1.5C goal.”"

It’s notable that geologists and meteorologists tend to be rather more openly skeptical of climate alarmism than many of their colleagues. Meteorologists are used to being held to account for their predictions, while geologists are used to evaluating the Earth’s environments in deep time. Geologists tend to take the long view, and to also be well aware that the Earth has seen many dramatic changes in its history.



At the Sydney Writers Festival in 2012, veteran journalist Alex Mitchell scoffed at the bright young things of modern journalism who almost never leave their desks to pursue stories. What does that have to do with climate change? Like their journalistic colleagues, fieldwork and gathering empirical data too often seem to be deprecated by many scientists, in favour of computer modelling. At the same time, researchers in some fields seem to take a foolishly short-term view of change.



But they **do** have a very good idea of how to skew their research for maximum funding.



Today, we have a whole generation of researchers whose entire experience of the [Great Barrier Reef (GBR)] has been in the context of finding, investigating and promoting environmental “threats” and they tend to perceive every fluctuation of nature as evidence of them.



The GBR is over at least half a million years old. Which means that it has so far survived far more extreme climatic variations that the less than one degree rise experienced over the last century, not to mention sea levels which have risen hundreds of metres. The idea that the Reef is about to suddenly keel over and die now is a historic nonsense.



Reefs are highly dynamic and variable communities […]The most easily accessible coastal reefs are especially subject to natural extremes of temperature, floods and storms that result in extensive coral mortality. The huge geographic area of the GBR means that damaged areas can always be found somewhere. For those with limited direct experience of reefs and primed by belief in a litany of hypothetical threats, every fluctuation of nature provides evidence that appears to confirm their hypotheses.



I’m old enough to remember when the Crown of Thorns starfish was on the verge of destroying the reef. The Crown of Thorns has vanished from popular imagination today, replaced by climate change – a “threat” based on little more than computer models.



Another factor in the growing detachment of environmental science from empirical reality has been the rise of computer modelling. This can be done comfortably in office hours, presents an aura of advanced expertise and certainty, can be “adjusted” to give desired results, and is inaccessible to independent examination.



Although computer modelling can be a powerful tool for analysis and prediction, this is true only where good input data are available, dynamics are well understood, and models are mathematically verified and empirically validated. None of this is true of environment modelling and the results are only the modeller’s opinion of a possibility.



In regard to GBR water quality and runoff, the following, from a 2006 study by Professor Robert Carter, remains true: “the claim of human-related nut­rient enrichment in the Tully River, and regionally, is without substance […]”



There is no actual evidence of decline in water quality and no reason to expect any. In fact, the opposite is true. The use of fertiliser and agrichemicals in the GBR catchment has decreased over recent decades. Traces of pesticides at their highest are well below any levels known to be harmful. Nutrient runoff to the reef is orders of magnitude less than natural fluctuations caused by internal waves from the open ocean and that are considered to be beneficial[…]



In any event, the corals on nearshore reefs are species adapted to turbid conditions and their frequent mortality from runoff is entirely due to fresh water, not to sediment, nutrients or agrichemicals.



Lack of evidence is no barrier however, to an activist with an ideological (not to mention government grant-fuelled financial) axe to grind. With a tweak of a computer model, the Reef is suddenly at death’s door, evidence be damned.



This is classic case of what Richard Feynman derided as [“Cargo Cult Science”](http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm): “science that isn’t science”. As Feynman said, **if scientific research is being skewed to the demands of politicians or activists, “you’re not giving scientific advice. You’re being used”**.



In this case, it’s the Australian taxpayers who are being had, who are being bilked to fund tendentious, sloppy research. Not to mention the farmers, manufacturers and tourist operators who are labouring under an ever-increasing burden of environmental red tape.

Another day, another Muslim whining about “oppression” and “racism”. Given Muslim majority countries’ [marked intolerance of anyone else](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/maps-and-graphics/mapped-the-most-tolerant-countries/), it’s somewhat remarkable just how fragile a glass jaw many Muslims seem to develop when **they’re** in the minority.



Even in Sydney, where [commuters have been advised against wearing Christian regalia](https://www.fox5ny.com/news/australian-wearing-cross-beaten-by-muslims) due to attacks by Muslims, and police and military are cautioned against wearing their uniforms in public, Muslims too frequently take great umbrage at being asked to abide by the same rules as everyone else.



A Muslim woman has accused a popular Sydney pub of discrimination, claiming she was barred from entering unless she removed her hijab.



Soaliha Iqbal said she was lining up with friends to enter the Paragon Hotel in Circular Quay for dinner after attending a climate change protest in Sydney’s CBD on Friday night. 



The 21-year-old journalism student alleges a hotel bouncer demanded she take off her religious veil in order to be allowed to enter the premises…’Before viewing my ID, the security pointed at my head and said ”take that off”,’ Ms Iqbal told Daily Mail Australia.



Leaving aside the small matter of why an apparently devout Muslim **was going to a pub** in the first place ([”the presence of alcohol means traditional pubs are off-putting to those who want to follow strict Islamic rulings”](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-558639/Welcome-Halal-Inn-Britains-alcohol-free-Islamic-pub.html)), the bouncer was making a perfectly reasonable request. Besides the security aspect, if premises are legitimately allowed to refuse entry because of someone’s shoes, shirt or shorts, there’s no reason they can’t do the same because of a silly hat.



Ms Iqbal alleges the bouncer became ‘instantly defensive’ before telling her to step aside.



‘You’re overreacting, you need to calm down,’ the bouncer told Ms Iqbal, she claimed.



Ms Iqbal said: ‘There was no dialogue, the first thing was ”take that off”. When I didn’t reply to that in a compliant way, I was told to stand aside.



Again, a perfectly reasonable request. Many years of watching bouncers in action suggests that she got off lightly. Many’s the argumentative prat I’ve seen cop a smack in the chops for being a pain in the arse.



Ms Iqbal and her friends then attempted to approach the entry to make a formal complaint with management. 



But as the group stood outside the venue, they were approached by a police officer.



Ms Iqbal said the group explained the altercation to the officer but were urged to ‘move along’.



The officer cited the NSW Liquor Act where people denied entry at a licensed premises are not allowed within 50 metres of the establishment.



Once again, all perfectly reasonable. She was told to leave, she and her pals decided to make a scene instead. So the law told them to move on.



But rules and laws are only for infidels, apparently.



‘The thing that I’m frustrated about is that everyone is questioning me swearing at the bouncer and nobody is really questioning why the bouncer upset me in the first place,’ she said.



Because the bouncer just did his job. Which shouldn’t have to entail being sworn at by some over-entitled prat with a persecution complex.

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel journalist Axel Bojanowski has an analysis on the Berlin climate negotiations now taking place among the leaders of 36 nations who have the aim of laying the groundwork for a binding climate treaty in Paris later this year.
The title: “They’re tricking; they’re getting creative.”
Bojanowski calls it the “big climate show”. Although big delcarations are being made, behind the scenes “creative steps” and “tricks” are the real order of the day.
Grandstanding
For example rich nations like France and Germany are climate grandstanding and promising to provide even more money to poor countries to help them fight climate change and switch over to renewable energy sources. But Bojanowski describes how no one appears to be really willing to make the hard compromises that alarmists are demanding. As a result countries are resorting to creative trickery to shirk real climate responsibility. For example climate insurances are to be set up in order to cover weather damages in poor countries, but not much else.
Ducking the real questions

Bojanowski writes, however, that the all-important and really decisive questions are being pushed to the sidelines, foremost:
How does the global community intend to curb the emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, which climate science says will result in considerable warming?”
Here the Spiegel journalist writes that it is still unclear for many EU countries how they will reach their stated targets. He also points out that it is unlikely the US Congress will vote for the government’s plan to curb emissions by 16% compared to 1990 levels. Especially unclear are also the plans for reductions from China, India and other developing countries.
One example of trickery comes from Russia, Bojanowski writes:
Although Russia has announced it wants to reduce emissions 25% by 2030 compared to 1990 – this is in fact trickery. Because of the collapse of its industry during the 1990s, the country is emitting only half as much CO2 as it did in 1990. That means with respect to climate targets, Russia intends to emit more CO2 in the future.”
And not less!
In Paris do expect the signing of a “binding international treaty”, but one that will be chock-full of non-binding requirements. The circus (which no one takes seriously anymore) thus will continue.

Share this...FacebookTwitterEarlier this year as the late autumn ran mild and the winter started well on the mild side  for Central Europe, meteorologists were projecting a “Majorca Winter”, after the tropical-like Spanish Island which is noted for its sunny and warm year-round weather. A sort of “barbeque winter” was all the talk.
But recently winter has tightened its grip over the continent, with snow and cold taking hold. Today Swiss meteorologist Jörg Kachelmann released his latest Youtube video calling that forecast nonsense.

Once again snow and winter refuse being relegated to a “thing of the past”.
The flamboyant Kachelmann, who is notoriously critical of seasonal forecasts, tells viewers the source of the current winter weather is a stubborn low centered over North central Europe that is pumping cold, unsettled air from the North Sea down over the mainland. Kachelmann sees the pattern sticking around for minimum 7 to 10 days, possibly longer.

Once you get away from the North Sea it really is winter everywhere and it’s going to stay that way for the next several days, with below normal temperatures; a longer winter phase – and so it was clear from the start with this nonsense of a Majorca winter with only very brief periods of cold and snow and so on; it was all stupidity – there’s going to be more snow…”
The NCEP forecast until mid February sees more of the same:
Winter extending to Spain. Image cropped here.
The above longer term forecast may change, of course. However the weather models runs have been pretty coming up with the same result for that last couple of days, and so don’t start dreaming of spring weather just yet.
Now is as a good a time as any to book a ski holiday in the mountains.

"**Facebook has begun labelling posts from US President Donald Trump about voting, including one that claimed current rules on postal votes could lead to a ""corrupt"" election.**
The Republican's posts now carry a link to official voting information.
The social network has also labelled several posts from Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.
It follows a promise to begin labelling all posts about voting in the 2020 election, from any politician.
This policy was implemented in June, following criticism that the social network was not doing enough to tackle misinformation.
Founder Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook would begin to label posts that mentioned voting, but said it was not going to be an easy job.
""If someone says on election day that a city has been identified as a Covid hotspot, is that vote suppression or simply sharing health information?"" he wrote in a blog.
""Because of the difficulty of judging this at scale, we are adopting a policy of attaching a link to our Voting Information Centre for posts that discuss voting, including from politicians. This isn't a judgement of whether the posts themselves are accurate, but we want people to have access to authoritative information either way.
At the time it was described by some as a compromise, because the blanket labelling would not allow people to distinguish legitimate posts about the election from misinformation.
Twitter began labelling some of the president's tweets in May, starting with one which referenced the Black Lives Matter protests, which was judged to glorify violence.
Some Facebook staff said at the time that they were ashamed that it did not remove or flag the same controversial post on its platform.
The Twitter labelling led to Mr Trump signing an executive order seeking to curb the longstanding legal protections of social media firms.
Mr Trump has also been vocal on social media about what he sees as the dangers of postal voting, known in the US as mail-out voting. He has repeatedly said that he does not trust it, but offers little evidence as to why he thinks it could lead to fraud.
Election experts have denied that this is the case. Postal voting could play a significant role in the 2020 election because of the coronavirus pandemic.
**By Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation reporter**
Facebook now looks to be following the blueprint set in May by Twitter in May, which first labelled Donald Trump's tweet when he criticised mail-out voting.
This does not come as a surprise, since the social media platform has been under increasing pressure from advertisers and campaign groups to do more to address misinformation on its site, especially from the US president in the build-up to the US election.
The approaches of the two social media platforms favoured by the US president still differ, though - as Facebook has pledged to label anything about voting in the US election that's shared, including by politicians, regardless of whether it's misleading.
This is a significant move from Facebook, which has previously seemed reluctant to tackle content shared by President Trump, and there is much speculation over why that is.
Nonetheless there are still big questions over Facebook's decision not to label other misleading claims made by President Trump about coronavirus, which Twitter has similarly refrained from flagging."

As we entered the dog days of summer, a flurry of negative economic news surfaced. The news from Continental Europe was worse than anticipated, catching most observers by surprise. Those who were caught off guard failed to keep their eyes focused on money and credit. In addition, they neglected to gauge geopolitical events and the state of economic confidence.



Money and credit fuel economies. Without enough fuel, economies stall. Moreover, money dominates fiscal policy. If monetary policy is loose and fiscal policy is tight, the economy will grow. Fiscal austerity won't throw things into reverse.



For example, when Bill Clinton entered the White House in 1993, the structural fiscal deficit was 5.3% of potential GDP. In the ensuing eight years, President Clinton squeezed out the fiscal deficits. When he left office in 2001, the government's accounts registered a structural surplus of 1.5%. Those Clinton years were marked by tight fiscal and loose monetary policies. The result was rapid economic growth. The reverse occurred in Japan during the 1990s. In an attempt to restart the economy, Japan engaged in repeated, massive, fiscal stimuli programs. These programs failed because monetary policy was tight.



The endless, post-crisis talk about fiscal austerity is misguided. When an economy is in a slump, all eyes should be on monetary policy.



With this monetary perspective, let's take a look at recent news from Continental Europe's three largest economies: Germany, France and Italy. Germany, Europe's economic locomotive, surprised everyone, shrinking by 0.2% in the second quarter of the year. The accompanying German money and credit chart tells the tale. Since early 2012, the money supply, broadly measured, has registered very anemic growth and credit has been declining. This tight monetary stance, coupled with the economic sanctions blow back from Russia, has taken the steam out of the German locomotive.





Recent economic data from France weren't much better than those from Germany. Growth was flat for the second quarter in a row. With no growth, and no growth in sight, Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, threw in the towel and announced that France would not be able to meet its fiscal deficit target of 3.8% of GDP. A review of France's money and credit picture shows why the economy is flat lining: money and credit growth have been flat since early 2012.





Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's Italian honeymoon ended abruptly in early August, when Italy achieved a rare feat. It entered a triple-dip recession. Yes, Italy's economy contracted for two successive quarters for the third time since 2007. As the accompanying chart shows, money growth in Italy has been flat for some time, and credit has been slowly shrinking since early 2009.





Why are Continental Europe's three largest economies in the grip of monetary austerity? To answer this, we must revert back to John Maynard Keynes at his best. Specifically, we must look at his two-volume 1930 work, A Treatise on Money — a work that Milton Friedman wrote about approvingly in 1997.



In particular, Keynes separates money into two classes: state money and bank money. State money is the high-powered money (the so-called monetary base) that is produced by central banks. Bank money is produced by commercial banks through deposit creation. Keynes spends many pages in the Treatise dealing with bank money. This isn't surprising because bank money was much larger than state money in 1930. Well, not much has changed since then. Today, bank money accounts for about 90% of the total Eurozone money supply, measured by M3.



So, bank money is the elephant in the room. Anything that affects bank money dominates the production of money. Bank regulations and their application have been aggressively ramped up since the crisis of 2009. These new regulations have been illconceived, pro cyclical, and fraught with danger, as the charts show.



Continental Europe's economic performance is, however, not only a problem of banks failing to produce money and credit; Europe's stagnation and slump are also the result of major structural economic rigidities (read: lack of free markets). Mario Draghi, the President of the European Central Bank, has repeatedly called for structural reforms in Europe's product and labor markets. He has a point. If market liberating reforms were implemented, they would give a much-needed confidence shock to the Eurozone.



Regardless of the particular problem being analyzed or the analytical apparatus used to diagnose it, confidence plays a critical role. Economists have long recognized the importance of confidence. Indeed, most economists find extremes hard to explain — either booms or busts — without reference to it. For example, the American economist Wesley Clair Mitchell (1874-1948) wove ""business sentiment"" into much of his pioneering work on business cycles. He was not alone.



Members of the Cambridge School of Economics, which was founded by Alfred Marshall (1842-1924), all concluded that fluctuations in business confidence are the essence of the business cycle. As John Maynard Keynes put it, ""the state of confidence, as they term it, is a matter to which practical men pay the closest and most anxious attention."" That is, of course, why Keynes put great stress on changes in confidence and how they affected consumption and investment  
patterns. Frederick Lavington (1881-1927), a Fellow of Emmanuel College and the most orthodox of the Cambridge economists, went even further in his 1922 book, The Trade Cycle. Lavington concluded that, without a ""tendency for confidence to pass into errors of optimism or pessimism,"" there would not be a business cycle.



Confidence enters into more modern discussions of business cycles, too. Robert Lucas, a Nobel Laureate and member of the Chicago School of Economics, has developed rational expectations tools for economic analysis. For members of the Chicago School, the credibility of government policies (read: their consistency and plausibility) is the major source of changes in confidence, and consequent swings in the business cycle.



The Cambridge economists rely on surveys of sentiments held by businessmen and consumers. These survey metrics are used to construct forecasts of economic activity. As reported in August, Germany's investor confidence index plunged — fueled by tensions with Russia — to a 20-month low. In France, the manufacturing business climate index has been falling for months. Italy's consumer confidence index was temporarily boosted, following Prime Minister Renzi's election in May, but has turned south since then.



If we move from Cambridge to Chicago, we find that the rational expectations crowd points to government policy as a generator of swings in confidence. In particular, these economists believe that the state of confidence hinges on whether governments and their policies are viewed as credible. This amounts to a perception about whether the various elements of a government's policy are logical and consistent. If policies are viewed as being illogical and/or internally inconsistent, confidence suffers. On this criterion, Continental Europe's confidence is very low. Many people believe that politicians are serving up a never-ending stream of ad hoc, incoherent, if not contradictory, policies.



Any way one looks at Continental Europe, the economic, political and geopolitical picture is not pretty.

"On a sunny day in early August 2019, screams broke the calm of a national park in East Africa. Researchers ran to find Kidman – an adult female chimpanzee – and her child being attacked by the dogs of poachers. In their desperate attempt to save them, the researchers fought off the dogs and removed a spear that poachers had lodged in Kidman’s back. She died shortly after the researchers had arrived, her infant a few days later. Primatologists around the world were in awe of the researchers’ heroic efforts, but we were also shocked that such a vicious attack could happen on the Ngogo apes of Kibale Forest in Uganda – one of the world’s best-known community of chimpanzees in one of Africa’s most famous national parks. Less than two months later, tragedy struck again. On September 13, less than 1,000km south of Kibale Forest in the Issa Valley of Tanzania, researchers found another two chimpanzees being attacked by dogs. Kitu, a two-year old infant, was mauled by four dogs while her mother, Kila, fought another six. The Issa chimpanzees live outside of national park boundaries and only became accustomed to human presence in 2018.  The researchers beat the dogs back, killing one and badly wounding the others. By the time the last dog limped away, Kila was bleeding badly and couldn’t stand. Kitu called despondently from a few trees away, but Kila didn’t look in her direction as she sat struggling to breathe. Eventually she recovered enough to stand and walk through the forest. Our team decided to stay with Kitu, monitoring the infant chimp, and assumed that Kila would return for her in time. They left her late in the day, with no sign of Kila. Like humans, infant chimpanzees nurse through the first years of their lives and rely on their mothers for transport and safety to show them what is safe to eat – and who is an ally and who an enemy. While chimpanzees often adopt orphans in their community, we knew Kitu was too young to survive long without Kila. The next morning, the team found Kitu not far from where they had left her, having travelled in the same direction as her mother the previous day. She was on the ground and seemed to have slept there – something chimpanzees rarely do when they live around predators. They’ve never been observed doing this at Issa. She could only muster groans, too weak to call. She died a few hours after the researchers found her, less than 24 hours since the dog attack. Chimpanzees led researchers to a feeding tree four days later, under which lay Kila, dead from her injuries. Chimpanzees and their cultures are under threat across Africa. Their forest habitats are being converted to farmland while human-transmitted diseases proliferate and decimate populations.  Chimpanzees are also hunted for the bushmeat trade – likely the single most acute threat to their survival in the wild. At Ngogo and Issa, it’s probable that bushmeat hunters were the culprits.  Combined, these threats have pushed chimpanzees onto the IUCN red list of endangered species. In some parts of Africa, chimpanzee populations have declined by 80% since 1990. Scientists are often forced into being advocates for the species they study – those who study primates often more so than others, simply because we share so much in common with our evolutionary cousins. To protect chimpanzees from the many threats to their survival, we often risk our own safety. Researchers at Issa advise armed patrols and support these teams when in the forest. Though we couldn’t save Kitu and Kila, the mere presence of researchers here helps protect chimpanzees. Besides collecting data on them, we monitor the forest for other wildlife, including leopards and antelope. We keep an eye on threats such as illegal logging and sponsor Tanzanian postgraduate students – the next generation of chimpanzee researchers.  In all this, we work closely with the district government, and the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI), a government research body that oversees all research in the country. TAWIRI expends tremendous effort to protect Tanzania’s chimpanzees, recently publishing a national conservation action plan.  We were too late to save Kila and Kitu, but as great ape scientists and conservationists, we’re determined to protect their community. If you would like to help us, please consider contributing to our cause. Our project - GMERC - has a registered non-profit sister group based in California that can receive your support – every dollar, euro, and pound which will go directly to facilitating anti-poaching patrols. Only with increased protection can we minimise the threat imposed by poaching and protect Issa’s chimpanzees."

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I posted on Part 1 of German ZDF television’s Terra-X series two-part documentary on climate and human history appearing on January 11  and 18. Part 1 covered the world’s climatic changes that occurred during the last ice age and up to the time of the Roman Empire.
Part 1 clearly showed that the earth’s climate changed naturally, at times very dramatically within a matter of a decade or two. Warm periods were accompanied by rains and periods of vibrant human prosperity. Cold periods saw droughts, crop failures, mass migrations and deadly political and societal instability.
Warm Roman Empire
Today the focus is on Part 2, which looks at the earth’s climate since the Roman Empire until today. It starts by stating how the “paradise-like” warmth during peak period of the Roman Empire was brought on by the optimal orientation between the earth and sun. The warm Roman period was marked by “stability” says Mark Maslin (3:10).

Tree ring studies from oak trees show that “the temperature 100 year before Christ indeed rose. On average the temperature was 2°C warmer than 100 years earlier” (3:37). Clearly such an increase is more than double today’s increase the globe has seen since 1900. That high Roman temperature level stayed some 300 years, the documentary tells us, allowing for “stable and strong growth“.
At the 4:30 mark the documentary tells us that glaciers in the Alps melted and allowed the Romans to expand their empire all the way to Scotland. The warm period also took hold globally, says the ZDF documentary, and was not a regional phenomena. The ZDF documentary shows at the 5:40 mark how the Chinese Empire blossomed at around 200 BC. All thanks to the sun.
Finally at the 8:24 mark German researcher Gunther Hischfelder of the University of Regensburg tells that the Romans eventually ran into an enemy they even could not vanquish: “Over the long-term there was one opponent that became so strong that even the Romans could not conquer it, and that was climate change.”
Always the sun
Surprisingly at the 8:38 mark, the ZDF documentary tells viewers something that has long been taboo in Germany:
Every climate change is controlled from outer space. It depends on the earth’s orbit around the sun, the tilt of its axis and on the predominant solar activity. After the change in times the solar activity was probably weaker and the Gulf current delivered less heat.”
This, the documentary says, led to a “clear [natural] cooling (9:00)“. Already in Part 2 we see that climate temperature changes of 2°C over a matter of decades were nothing unusual – and were all owing to natural factors that scientists today refuse to acknowledge are in play.
Cold…fall of Roman Empire
As the cooler temperatures began to take over during the Roman period, catastrophic droughts took hold and crop failures led to starvation. Rome was under pressure to supply food to its remote territories and outposts.
To illustrate the degree hardship, scientists analyzed the bones of a north German teenager uncovered from the swamps(10:10). DNA analysis of the arm and leg bones showed severe malnutrition. Twelve of the child’s 14 years were spent in a state of “severe hunger”. As had happened many times over the course of history, mass migrations occurred as cold led to crop failures.
Just before the end of the Roman Empire, these migrations were facilitated as natural borders and barriers such as large rivers and marshes froze over and allowed people easily walk across them (11:40).  For example in the year 406 AD, 90,000 Germanic tribespeople crossed a Frozen Rhine river and into Roman territory (11:58) in a single day. Bit by bit the Roman Empire was invaded before collapsing ushering in the post Roman dark ages.
llopango
This dark period was exacerbated further by the mega-eruption of llopango in El Salvador (13:02), which led to written records of extreme cold and darkness in the year 536 AD. Scientists believe the eruption ejected 84 cubic kilometers of ash into the atmosphere, destroying everything within a 1000 km radius and darkening the skies over Europe and even China. Ash from the llopango eruption is even seen in ice cores from Antarctica (15:55). The material reached into the stratosphere and caused an “18-month long climate anomaly of cold and darkness“. Millions of people of people died as a result.
As fear gripped the planet and nature regained the upper hand, the conditions became ideal for religions to thrive, warning of the wrath of God and offering the hope of salvation (20:00).
Rise of Central American civilizations
While war and fear plagued Europe, climate conditions were however ideal in Central America, and civilizations there blossomed (22:00). At the 22:30 mark we see the Nazca Lines (before they were ruined by Greenpeace). By 900 AD, natural climate change struck the Central American region again as prolonged droughts ground down the once mighty Latin American cultures (22:45). What was behind the sudden change? At the 23:20 mark the documentary again points at the sun.
Responsible was solar activity.”
Medieval Warm Period by the sun

But the documentary dances around about how solar activity impacts the earth, hinting at basic solar irradiance, and avoiding Svensmark’s theory.  At the 24:15 mark:
That also applies to the year 800 AD. The sun is at a maximum activity. It’s irradiance especially strong. The blue planet gradually begins to heat up.”
The warmth, the documentary says, “opened up the Arctic from North America to Europe” and allowed explorers to venture out and the Vikings to settle in “an almost ice-free” Iceland and in Greenland (25:30) 1050 years ago. Lief Ericson reached Newfoundland at about the year 1000 AD (26:30). In Europe the warming took hold with a vengeance. The documentary says at the 26:50 mark:
On average the temperature was 3°C warmer than the years before.”
Europe was transformed into a rich bread-basket (27:20). The weather was once again stable and planning was possible. At this point we get hints that the documentary is trying to tells us that normal weather in warm times is stable. Yet history tells us that storms also occurred during the warm Medieval Period.
Gunther Hischfelder tells that the warm period of the Medieval Period had consquences (29:25):
The creation of cities was a response to climate change and provided the spark for a take-off for human history, an explosion in culture and civilization, and is thus the reason it is the cornerstone for the creation of our modern world.”
All thanks to the Medieval Warm Period (MWP), which was as warm and even warmer than today. At the 29:50 mark we see that “three quarters of Germany’s cities were created during the Medieval Warm Period”. Growth exploded all over Europe. By the year 1250 AD, “Europe’s societies were as strong as never before” (31:35).
Strangely, and probably on purpose, the ZDF documentary focusses only on Europe for its look at the Medieval Warm Period, and presents no examples of it occurring at other locations on the globe – as it did for the earlier warm periods. Is the ZDF trying to have us believe that MWP was regionally isolated in Europe? Scientific proxy data tell us it was warm all over the globe.
Sun strangely disappears as a climate factor in the year 1250
At the 32:00 mark the documentary looks at the beginning of the end of the MWP: “In the second half of the thirteenth century it got markedly colder in Europe“. The reason was a number of erupting volcanoes at various locations around the globe, the documentary says (32:10) that it cooled the global climate for almost 500 years. So according to the ZDF, the sun stopped playing a role in climate change 800 years ago. Strange that all the other climate changes before that, the sun was always to blame.
No matter what the real reason for the post MWP cooling may have been, the ZDF tells us that it was warm during the Medieval Warm Period and that it then cooled substantially after 1300 AD. That de facto refutes the bogus claims of a steady climate made by Michael Mann.
Longest cold period since the last ice age
In fact, the ZDF documentary calls the Little Ice Age, which had a solid lock on Europe by the year 1500 AD, “the longest cold period since the last ice age” (33:15).  And there’s a huge magnitude of literature available from the times clearly documenting the extreme weather and hardship endured by Europe during this time. Here old records describe extreme storms and harsh weather, crop failures, starvation, pestilence and widespread death (36:00). In just 100 years, the population reduced by one third. Fear gripped the continent and sorcerers were blamed (36:50). (Sound familiar?) 60,000 people were burned at the stake for “cooperating with the Devil” in brewing bad weather. Today we have crazed lawyers wanting to put industries on trial for the same thing.
Clearly the ZDF documentary tells us that cold periods are disasters, and warm ones, like the one we are witnessing today, are hugely advantageous.
At the 37:30 mark the ZDF describes how glaciers advanced over North America, Scandinavia and the Alps, where entire villages were swallowed by the ice. Things got so bad that Europe plunged into war and mayhem (38:20), eventually culminating in the French Revolution (39:10). The final icing on the cake was delivered by the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815, which gave the world the year without a summer in 1816 (40:30).
Modern warming – sun nowhere near in sight
The Little ice Age ended around 1850 with what the ZDF suprisingly calls the “beginning of a period with moderate and stable temperatures. It characterizes the weather until today.” (41:30).
At the 42:00 minute mark the ZDF finally deviates from reason, claiming that for the first time in history, with industrialization, man has changed the climate of the earth. No more mention of the sun as a factor, which made its last appearance on the climate stage 800 years ago. Now it’s mankind’s fault. I was expecting the documentary to end in this silly way, and I was not wrong in doing so.
Mad Maslin
Mark Maslin at the end puts the icing on the cake, making a totally insane comment at the 42:30 mark where he proclaims that man actually now has the chance to take control of the climate – away from the sun, oceans and other forces of nature. Try not to burst out laughing:
We are now at the point where we can decide what the climate of the future will look like. When we as a world community, all nations working together, are able to really prevent global warming, that would be fantastic. That would be the first time that the climate doesn’t control us, but rather us would control it. We can make sure that all future generations will have a stable climate.”
Wow! Just pay them indulgences. Apart from Maslin’s and the ZDF’s sheer nonsense in the last two minutes, an excellent documentary on the climate since the last ice age.

Modern economic growth is an instance of an underdetermined problem, for which the number of potential explanations dramatically exceeding the number of available data points. In an earlier post, I compared the rise of the West to Mona Lisa. Just like the rise to prominence of Da Vinci’s painting, modern economic growth has no observed counterfactual and numerous alternative explanations, ranging from coal, through human capital, to institutions, or culture. Discriminating among them is far from straightforward.





Maybe it is time to give up on economics as a source of certain and quantifiable answers about the deep drivers of modern prosperity.



A recent paper by William Easterly and Ross Levine (discussed by Chris Blattman here) makes two important contributions to this field of inquiry. One is indirect but noteworthy to historians—providing a new database of the share of European population in colonies at the early stages of colonization. Secondly, the paper tries to give a partial answer to the _big question_ of what shaped comparative economic development around the globe by looking at the link between the size of early European population and present‐​day economic outcomes.



Clearly, colonialism was a source of terrible injustice and human suffering. Worse yet, European settlers typically brought diseases that wiped out large segments of local populations. Easterly and Levine don’t deny any of this. Instead, they are interested in the question of whether the presence of Europeans has generated—notwithstanding the obvious moral wrongness of colonialism—any significant long‐​term economic benefits.



In fact, the paper uses the immunity of local populations to European germs as a source of exogenous variation in European settlement patterns. Europeans colonized most prominently places with temperate climate and other desirable characteristics, which can be conceivably linked to long‐​term economic prosperity.



However, Europeans also settled more heavily in those regions where they encountered little resistance from the indigenous populations. Such resistance was weakened dramatically if exposure to European microbes triggered extremely high mortality rates amongst the locals. Because there is little reason to expect past microbial resistance to affect present‐​day economic outcomes through other channels than just by shaping the density of European settlements and because such resistance was unrelated to other characteristics of these areas, it provides us with a way of assessing the direct effect of European colonization on economic outcomes.



The results are quite remarkable. Practically one half of the variation in average global development levels today can be accounted for by the size of the initial European settlement. Their results are at odds, they argue, with the story told by Acemoglu and Robinson about extractive and inclusive institutions that colonists brought with them to different regions of the world. Their version of the institutional story predicts that in places where Europeans did not want to settle in large numbers were permanently damaged by the import of extractive economic institutions. Easterly and Levine, in contrast, find that the presence of any Europeans—however few and wherever they came from—had a strong positive effect on economic outcomes.



But what exactly is the channel through which the presence of Europeans influenced present‐​day economic outcomes? Easterly and Levine claim that their story is consistent with the notion of human capital playing a decisive role in shaping development. Europeans brought human capital and institutions underpinning the generation of new human capital. Obviously, their results lend only indirect support to that idea.



Europeans brought many things with them—informal norms and culture, legal norms, political institutions, specific technologies—and there is no easy way of disentangling the effects of those on economic outcomes. It may, of course, be possible to see human capital more broadly, as encompassing some of those other attributes, but that would take the analytical edge off the human capital‐​centered accounts of development.



At the same time, narrow understanding of human capital does not seem to resonate with experience. For example, the 19th‐​century Chinese immigration to South East Asia recruited disproportionate numbers of impoverished peasants from Southern China, which would become indentured laborers. Yet, within a couple of generations, this diaspora would becomea motor  of economic development in places like Singapore and Malaysia—often in spite of overt hostility and discrimination. It is quite plausible that the Chinese immigrants succeeded because of the social norms they brought with them, but it is much less likely that they succeeded because of some narrowly defined set of skills they brought with them.



Given that economics deals with humans, it cannot escape some degree of conceptual fuzziness. More importantly, the _big question_ seems unlikely to be elucidated significantly through further cross‐​country evidence, no matter how cleverly obtained. Maybe it is time to approach it in a more humble way—e.g. by studying growth miracles and growth disasters (ideally accompanied by natural experiments)—and to give up on economics as a source of certain and quantifiable answers about the deep drivers of modern prosperity.

 ** _Congress should_**



• repeal national air and water quality laws and regulations that involve localized pollution; and  
• set a price on emissions or limits on the quantity of emissions and funnel the proceeds from the sales to those who are exposed to pollutants.



Current federal air pollution regulations are heavily influenced by concerns about particulate matter (PM). According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), “particle pollution is made up of a number of components, including acids (such as nitrates and sulfates), organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles.” These emissions are linked to a number of different negative health effects. Reducing exposure to fine particulate matter often accounts for 90 percent of the estimated benefits of air regulations, according to the EPA.



How much should we reduce PM? Because pollution decisions necessarily involve one choice for many people, conflict arises when answering that question. Normal public‐​sector budgetary struggles result from participants having different preferences and willingness to pay for desired outcomes, with policymakers ultimately making choices that more or less correspond to the preferences of the median voter. But environmental policy conflict manifests itself as struggles over science. You can’t just want cleaner (or dirtier) air because of your willingness (or lack thereof) to pay for it. Instead your preferences must be supported by scientific estimates.



Science plays a disproportionate role in environmental quality policy disputes because the federal Clean Air Act demands it. Every five years the EPA must prepare a document that “accurately reflects the latest scientific knowledge” on the health effects of exposure. It must then set a standard that is “requisite to protect the public health, … allowing an adequate margin of safety” to ensure “an absence of adverse effect on the health of a statistically related sample of persons in sensitive groups.” The Supreme Court ruled in 2001 in _Whitman v. American Trucking Association_ that the Clean Air Act “unambiguously bars cost considerations from the [pollution limits]-setting process.” Thus, EPA decisions on conventional pollutants are all about the benefits of emission reduction as ascertained by science because that is exactly what the law instructs the EPA to do.



Science also plays a disproportionate role in environmental policy because of political benefits. Delegating decisions to the EPA and “science” allows members of Congress not to have to make explicit decisions about environmental benefits and their costs.



Estimates of the effects of reduction in exposure to PM come from two studies: the American Cancer Society Study (ACS) and the Harvard Six Cities Study (SCS). The ACS follows 500,000 adults and the SCS follows 8,000 adults over time, estimating their relative risk of dying prematurely given their differing levels of exposure to PM.



The two studies have been the subject of much criticism. The Health Effects Institute, an air pollution research institute funded by both the EPA and the auto industry, reanalyzed the ACS study in 2000 and found anomalies. Increased PM exposure was associated with increased mortality for men but not women, those with high school or less education but not college graduates, and those who were moderately active but not sedentary or very active. Such variation is difficult to explain biologically.



When migration rates were included as a control variable in the statistical analyses, the PM effect disappeared. Cities that lost population in the 1980s were Rust Belt cities that had higher PM levels. People who migrated away from those cities were healthier and younger. The PM effect was more likely nonrandom migration away from older cities rather than an actual pollution‐​exposure effect.



Over time, PM levels have decreased and medical advances have increased. Thus, the reduction in mortality associated with fine‐​particle exposure also could be the result of better medical care rather than fine‐​particle reduction.



Pollution epidemiology research usually involves associations of _levels_ of exposure with mortality rates. The association between higher PM concentrations and mortality rates is a cross‐​sectional relationship across cities with different levels of PM and different mortality rates. And yet the policy question is whether _changes_ in exposure produce _changes_ in health outcomes. It is certainly true that mortality rates among the elderly are higher in locations that have higher PM levels. But _increases_ in PM concentrations from one year to the next are _negatively_ associated with changes in mortality.



As part of their policymaking, the EPA also uses a consulting firm to survey 12 experts (including three of the authors of the ACS and SCS studies) to ascertain their confidence in whether the statistical relationship between PM exposure and premature mortality found in the studies was causal. Four of the 12 experts said there was a probability of 10–65 percent that there was no causal relationship between PM concentration and mortality. Three experts said there was a 5 percent probability of noncausality, while another five experts said there was a probability between 0 and 2 percent. Only one of those five said there was a 0 percent probability of noncausality. Under the standard requirement of keeping the probability of false positive effects to less than 5 percent, the majority of the surveyed experts did not reject a null hypothesis of noncausality. A 95 percent confidence interval would include zero mortality effect for any reductions below 16 micrograms per cubic meter. Yet, despite this “science,” in December 2012, the EPA set a fine‐​PM standard of 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air, to be met by 2020.



Critics of such regulation typically argue that “sound science” supports less stringent requirements. According to that view, if more people understood the tenuous nature of the evidence linking reduction in current pollution exposure to improved morbidity and mortality, political support for the current environmental policy regime would diminish.



But recent work by Yale law professor and cultural theorist Dan Kahan suggests that people’s views about environmental policy relate to their cultural group identity, not scientific literacy. Those who are _more_ scientific and numerate disagree _more_ about environmental policy than those who are less informed. When acceptance of scientific evidence conflicts with group values, science loses and group values win.



So when you hear someone invoke the term “sound science,” don’t think of it as a call for another review of the literature by the National Academy of Sciences. Instead, think about “sound science” as a signal about a struggle over the initial allocation of property rights — that is, the right to differing levels of environmental quality — and the possibility that people can realize large benefits from being able to trade those rights, even if they have strong preferences for different pollution levels.



In this view, the Clean Air Act gives implicit property rights to people who want very low pollution levels. Notice the language quoted above that the EPA must set standards that ensure “an absence of adverse effect on the health of a statistically related sample of persons in sensitive groups.” Entities that would prefer a lower level of environmental quality would be willing to pay a large amount to have relaxed requirements. “Persons in sensitive groups” — that is, people especially concerned about pollution (e.g., asthmatics) — might well accept such a payment in lieu of the EPA‐​required emissions reduction.



From this perspective, the most important irrationality of environmental regulation is not its allocation of rights to a pristine environment backed by questionable scientific evidence, but its not allowing those initial decisions to be altered by subsequent trading. In this view, the role of government is to facilitate the development of secondary markets for public goods that would enable flows of money in the form of emissions fees or rights transfers that go directly from emitters to citizens in return for consent to change ambient air quality.



What level of government should facilitate such bargains? Before the nationalization of environmental policy in 1970, environmental quality was a local issue. Some areas were dirty and others were not. But under the imposition of federal pollution requirements in 1970, the cheapest way for local areas to comply was for them to mandate dramatically taller smoke stacks, which in essence transferred local pollution to downwind areas. As long as smokestack heights are low and transport is minimal, environmental quality is a local issue. Thus, the relevant unit of government to facilitate these bargains is probably at the metropolitan level.

Eeny, meeny, NIWA, mo. Pick a number; you’re good to go. That’s the state of climate science at the Ministry for Environment, it’s absolutely farcical, and that’s a fact.   




Just two years ago NIWA announced that for the period 1993-2016 the oceans surrounding New Zealand showed **no discernible increase in temperature**. The monitoring of ocean temp’s from satellite observations has been relatively long-standing, the methodology comprehensively reviewed and standardised with NIWA proclaiming absolute faith in the processes and findings of their decades of research:



Fast-forward just two years and suddenly everything has changed. Beggaring belief our Ministry for Environment claims that, according to NIWA, New Zealand oceans have been heating up at some of the highest rates in the world for the last four decades! (The global average increase is 0.11° per decade)



“Key results were as follows: 



• **Oceanic SST** : Significant positive trends 1981-2018 in SST at the EEZ scale, and in four descriptive regions (Chatham Rise, Tasman Sea, Subtropical Water, Subantarctic Water), with average trends of 0.1–0.2°C per decade which is similar to the global average rate of ocean warming.”



What the heck happened here? Has pressure been put on NIWA to abandon their earlier science and produce something more suited to the doom-spruik global-warming narrative? And if so, how do they justify the new numbers because the differences between the two statements are irreconcilable. 



Confused, I asked MfE what was going on, and interestingly, the correspondent from MfE fibbed:



“the processing and spatial resolution of the satellite sensor data used in this recent 2019 analysis **improves on past updates** and this allows us to be more confident in determining trends. The statement “no trend could be determined” from 2016/2017 referred to a **different time period (1993-2016) where less data was available.** ” [emphasis mine]



The writer from MfE assured me NIWA were “ **confident** ” about the figures, quoting ‘ _Pinkerton, et al 2019’._  




I was surprised then, to find on reading [‘](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/marine/satellite-indicators-of-phytoplankton-and-ocean-surface-temperature-new-zealand) _[Pinkerton, et al 2019’](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/publications/marine/satellite-indicators-of-phytoplankton-and-ocean-surface-temperature-new-zealand)_ , the warming claim is **not** based on improvement but a **different analysis** including (curiously) the “temperature-estimation algorithms” of **the very same** **data** used to produce the earlier results, and that the authors are **not confident** at all of the re-interpreted results. In a section discussing the contradictions arising from the more recent figures the authors write:



“It is not known which [sst] product should be preferred for state of the Environment reporting…”



While in the summary they go further:



“At present, **it is not possible to recommend using one SST dataset over another**.”



You’ve got to feel a little sorry for Principal Scientist Matt Pinkerton; he put the riders in the report but MfE just went ahead and ignored them. While Pinkerton says, “it is not possible to recommend using one SST dataset over another”, MfE choose the one that suits them.



Amazing, eh? 



Poor Mr Pinkerton also pleads for something eminently sensible – he reckons they should go and physically take the ocean’s temperature:



“Comparison of satellite measurements of SST with in situ measurements (from coastal stations and research vessels) may be useful in helping to recommend the appropriate data to use for New Zealand environmental reporting in the future.”



Sorry; Matt, no chance. Why go out and measure the stuff when MfE can have you pore over the numbers and input different algorithms until they get a result they want?

"One of the last things that Theresa May did before she left office as the UK prime minister in July 2019 was to commit the country to a net zero carbon target in 2050. Weaning the entire economy off carbon-based fuels on this sort of timescale sounds ambitious, but several advanced economies have set targets considerably sooner than this.  Sweden and New Zealand are aiming for 2045, Finland for 2035 and Norway for 2030 – the most ambitious of any government. Extinction Rebellion has called for the UK to eliminate all carbon emissions by 2025. Our recent working paper explores the justification for these various targets. The starting point is the global carbon budget calculated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This is the total amount of carbon that can be emitted into the atmosphere from now until the end of this century. The most recent estimate of a global budget that would offer a 66% chance of limiting climate warming to within 1.5C above the pre-industrial average is 420 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. Working from here to a carbon budget for each country is both a technical and an ethical question. Using the UK as a detailed example, a simple proportional allocation would give the UK a budget of approximately 2.9 billion tonnes. But given the UK’s historical responsibility for carbon in the atmosphere and the undeniable need for development in the poorest countries in the world, there is a very strong argument that the UK should adopt a fair carbon budget somewhat lower than this. So, for example, if the poorer countries in the world were to have an allowable carbon budget just one-third higher than the richer countries, this would lead to a fair carbon budget for the UK of around 2.5 billion tonnes. The question of how long this budget might last has no simple answer, because it depends how fast carbon emissions are cut over time. Remaining within any given budget depends inherently on the emissions pathway the country follows. If we cut emissions faster, we can afford a later target. If we cut too slowly, the budget will be exhausted, and we would be faced with the task of installing uncertain and costly negative emissions technologies to take carbon out of the atmosphere for the rest of the century. The UK’s carbon footprint in 2018 was about 590m tonnes, measured on a “consumption basis”, which includes the carbon in imports but excludes that of exports. This footprint has been falling slowly (at around 1.5% a year) since 2010. But if it continued to fall this slowly, the carbon budget would be exhausted by 2023, in just four years’ time (Scenario a). Even if we assume a straight-line reduction to zero emissions in 2050 (Scenario b), we would still generate a carbon overdraft approximately three times our allowable budget. In fact, the latest date by which we could draw a straight line from our current level of emissions to zero and still remain within the budget would be 2025 (Scenario c). A target later than 2025 is possible only if the UK reduces emissions faster than the straight line pathway in the early years. In order to extend the target date for zero carbon to 2050, emission cuts would need to be in the region of 24% every year for the next three decades (Scenario d). What is notable about this pathway is that, within little more than a decade, carbon emissions must already have fallen to a very low level. With a 24% annual rate of reduction, UK emissions in 2030 would only be 22m tonnes – less than 5% of the current level of emissions. Only a small programme of negative emissions technologies would be needed to achieve net zero at this point. Clearly the challenge is still colossal. A 24% reduction in emissions amounts to a cut of 140 million tonnes in the very first year alone. The UK has never achieved anything close to this since its carbon footprint was first measured in 1990. In 2009, when the economy was in recession, the carbon footprint fell by 80m tonnes, while its best post-crisis reduction saw a fall of only 38m tonnes in 2016. It is dangerously misleading for advanced nations to set target dates as far out as 2050. Doing so ignores the importance of staying within a fair carbon budget and gives a false impression that action can be delayed. In reality, the only way to ensure that any developed country remains within its fair budget is to aim for an early net zero target. For the UK, that means bringing forward the government’s target by at least two decades. This might all seem daunting, but every year that progress is delayed, the challenge only gets bigger. Remaining within a fair carbon budget for the rest of this century requires deep and early decarbonisation. Anything else will risk a climate catastrophe.

Does Narendra Modi actually have a great Gujarat model, or just well packaged hype? Critics say that Gujarat has grown fast, but some others have grown faster.



The Raghuram Rajan Committee on development indicators says Gujarat’s social indicators are just middling. Looking at children of class 3–5 who can do subtraction, Gujarat has declined from 22nd among 28 states in 2006 to 23rd in 2012. However, economist Arvind Panagariya argues that Gujarat has made substantial social progress under Modi, starting from a low base.





EFSI and other studies show that Gujarat has good governance.



Forget this debate. Neither growth nor social indicators are accurate measures of Modi’s main election plank — good governance. Measuring governance is difficult, and hence neglected by statisticians. Yet it’s all‐​important. One annual report has long provided indicators of governance. This is Economic Freedom of the States of India (EFSI), written by Bibek Debroy, Laveesh Bhandari and me. The 2013 EFSI report shows Gujarat has been No. 1 in economic freedom for the last three years, widening its lead over others. On a scale from 0 to 1, its overall freedom score has improved from 0.46 to 0.65. Tamil Nadu comes a distant second with 0.54. Economic freedom is not identical to good governance. But lack of economic freedom typically means poor governance — a jungle of rules and obfuscating bureaucrats that promote corruption, delay and harassment. This hits everybody from farmers and consumers to industrialists and transporters.



What exactly is economic freedom? EFSI uses a methodology adapted from Economic Freedom of the World, an annual publication of the Fraser Institute. Data for Indian states is not available on many issues. So, EFSI limits itself to 20 indicators of the size and efficiency of state governments, their legal structure and property rights, and regulation of labour and business.



Many of these indicators directly measure governance — the proportion of stolen property recovered; proportion of judicial vacancies; proportion of violent crimes; proportion of investigations completed by police and of cases completed by the courts; and the pendency rate of corruption cases. The list is by no means comprehensive, but provides strong clues.



Gujarat is the best state in pendency of corruption cases, and in the proportion of non‐​violent crime. It is close to the top in completion of police investigations. It scores poorly in judicial vacancies and recovery of stolen property.



Its quality of government spending is high: it has the lowest ratio of administrative GDP to total GDP. Spending is focused on infrastructure rather than staff. Modi’s repeated state election victories show that his approach produces high voter satisfaction. Gujarat is not a classical free‐​market state. It has large, expanding public sector companies, and substantial taxes on capital and commodities. It has many subsidies, though fewer than in other states. Still, business thrives in its business‐​friendly climate. One businessman told me that in Tamil Nadu, it took six months and several visits (and payments) to ministries for industrial approval. But in Gujarat, the ministry concerned called him the day before his appointment, asking for details of his proposal. Next day, he found the bureaucracy had in advance prepared plans of possible locations for his project, and settled the matter on the spot. This was unthinkable elsewhere, and showed both efficiency and honesty. Corruption has not disappeared in Gujarat, but is muted.



Modi’s Jyotigram scheme provides 24/7 electricity for rural households, plus reliable power at fixed times for tubewells. This explains why Gujarat has India’s fastest agricultural growth (10%/year for a decade, say economists Gulati and Shah). Indian agriculture is crippled by regulations, but Gulati shows that Gujarat has the highest agricultural freedom among states. Modi charges farmers for power, and so all his three state power companies are profitable. By contrast, power companies in other states with free rural power have accumulated losses of almost Rs 200,000 crore.



Critics accuse him of giving cheap land to favoured industrialists. But state and national governments the world over use such sops to attract industries. Unlike most politicians, Modi has clearly not enriched himself.



Good governance includes communal peace. So, the 2002 Muslim killings reflect terribly on Modi. For some, it puts him beyond the pale. But since 2002 the state has been peaceful. In 2011-12 , Gujarat had the lowest Muslim rural poverty rate among all states. Its overall poverty rate for Muslims (11.4%) was far lower than for Hindus (17.6%). This was also true of six other states, so Gujarat is not unique in this.



In sum, EFSI and other studies show that Gujarat has good governance. It has social and communal flaws. But it is India’s top state in economic and agricultural freedom. That’s not hype.

Fossil fuel plants unexpendable
Days ago German flagship daily Die Welt here reported that Germany’s energy industry is not happy about the recent developments in the electricity markets. Industry representatives warn that the Energiewende (transition to renewable energies) will not work without conventional power plants.
As mentioned earlier, Germany’s grand coalition government led by Angela Merkel increasingly finds itself struggling to maneuver to appease both industry on one side and Germany’s powerful environmental lobby groups on the other. As electricity prices continue their steep climb and grid stability crumbles, the government may soon find itself paying lip service to climate protection and nothing more.
Energy concept in “worrisome state”
According to Die Welt, Hildegard Müller, Director of the German BDEW industry association representing the energy and water utilities, said in a press release that Germany’s energy concept was in a “worrisome state“. She said “There is nothing in it that helps, but plenty that burdens.”
Other reports mention that Müller was uncharacteristically harsh with her criticism of the government’s tattered energy policy.
Fossil fuel capacity “melting away like butter”
Müller worries that soon there will not be enough conventional power plants operating to ensure a supply of power when wind and solar energy are absent. As companies are forced to buy up wind and solar power and to thus run their conventional power plants over increasingly shorter times, fossil fuel plants are becoming loss-intensive and so many power companies are planning to shut them down entirely. Die Welt reports:
According to figures presented in Hannover by the BDEW, the current over-capacity of conventional power plant facilities is melting away like butter in the spring sun.”

Lack of weather-independent power
Die Welt writes that 53% of planned new power plants are currently lacking an investment decision. So, the question arises: How soon can Germany expect trouble if energy policy fails to get back onto a sensible course? Die Welt writes:
Just after the shutdown of nuclear power plants concludes, in seven years there could be a lack of power plants that can operate independently of the weather.”
“Poorly thought out”, “thousands of jobs” at risk
Müller also calls the government’s plans to burden old power plants with additional charges “poorly thought out” and “politically motivated“. The industry fears the loss of thousands of jobs.
World Bank increases 3rd world investments in coal power
Meanwhile, as an aside, German alarmist site klimaretter.de here writes that even the World Bank refuses to divest from coal power plants.
In 2014, compared to a year earlier, the World Bank expanded investments in coal projects. […] New figures show that 3.4 billion euros in credits, subsidies and guarantees have flowed to fossil fuel projects in developing countries.
In other words, even if Germany does shut down plants, other countries will continue building them and CO2 reductions will remain as nothing  more than a pipe dream.

Not long ago flagship ARD television, using tricky wording, sadly misled viewers into thinking that the more than 15,000 deaths caused by the Japan tsunami of 2011 were caused by the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown (Reality: not a single death has yet to be attributed to leaked radiation).

River delta in India and Bangladesh sinking away: N24 forgets to mention sediment compaction as an important reason for rising waters

Climatic apocalyptic mood on 19 February 2015 at n24:

Extreme climate change: The Sundarbans have 15 years left
Climate change is threatening all of humanity, but some are especially impacted. In the Sundarbans already the livelihoods of 13 million people are threatened. […] Sea water has already swept over the spot of land on the Indian island of Bali where Mondol grew rice and operated fish ponds – just like earlier generations since about 200 years ago. Water has taken everything else away – and one day it will also take away the hut. ‘Every year we have to move a bit further inland,’ he says. Bali is considerably smaller than the Indonesian island with the same name. Mondol lives in the Sundarbans, a low lying delta region between India and Bangladesh that has 200 islands and round about 13 million inhabitants. Most of the homes are in an impoverished condition. The sea level in the region is rising about twice as fast as the global average. Tens of thousands already have become homeless. According to estimates by scientists, a large part of the Sundarbans could be submerged in 15 to 25 years.”

Delta regions are known for the gradual stabilization of their sediment – so-called compaction – sinking. This small detail was simply left out by n24. Here on April 30, 2013 Nature India explicitly pointed out that the flooding was not solely due to climate change:
Seven years after the first report on the ‘vanishing islands’ of Sundarbans, Subhra Priyadarshini revisits the fragile delta in the Bay of Bengal to find that it is not just climate change that threatens the existence of this world heritage mangrove tiger-land spread across the Indo-Bangladesh border. […] ‘In the last 25 years, the rate of relative sea level rise comes close to 8 mm/year, significantly higher than the rate of 3.14 mm/year in the previous decade,’ he says. In a recent report he co-authored for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)3, Hazra says besides global warming and the subsequent thermal expansion of water, the rather rapid subsidence of the Bengal delta (2-4 mm/year), compaction of silt and other local causes may be responsible for the exceptionally high rate of relative sea level rise in the Indian Sundarbans.
Science has already intensively studied the subsidence problem, and so it is peculiar that n24 did not mention this result. Geologist Till Hanebuth reported in 2013 on results from the delta region of Bangladesh. His team found natural subsidence of more than 4 millimeters per year. This rate is considerably higher than the climatic-related sea level rise. In the description of results of a project by the Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Association) it is stated:
Assessing the recent subsidence of the central coastal Delta of Bangladesh by dating submerged kilns The densely populated low lying Ganges‐Brahmaputra Delta is highly vulnerable to the global sea‐ level rise. In order to estimate the subsidence of the delta, we examined submerged salt‐producing kiln sites in the coastal Sundarbans. These kilns were built just above the previous winterly spring high‐tide level, but are currently located ~155 cm below the corresponding modern level. According to optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, the kilns were ultimately fired ~300 years ago and salt production was terminated by a catastrophic event, which affected the kiln sites at different levels and locations. AMS‐14C ages of charcoal at the kiln’s base and associated mangrove stump horizons support the OSL dates. Based on the elevations and the ages, the 300‐year‐average rate of sinking of the outer delta is 5.2 ± 1.2 mm/a, which includes 0.8 mm/a of eustatic sea‐level rise. Reasonably postulating that the subsidence rate will not change during the next few decades and accepting the estimates of current sea‐ level rise of 1.8–3.0 mm/a or 2.7–7.1 mm/a, a RSL rise of 6.4 ± 1.7 mm/a or 8.9 ± 3.3 mm/a, respectively, must be assumed along the Sundarbans coasts.”
Similar subsidence was also found by Stanley & Hait (2000).

"Spreading rock dust on farmland could suck billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air every year, according to the first detailed global analysis of the technique. The chemical reactions that degrade the rock particles lock the greenhouse gas into carbonates within months, and some scientists say this approach may be the best near-term way of removing CO2 from the atmosphere.  The researchers are clear that cutting the fossil fuel burning that releases CO2 is the most important action needed to tackle the climate emergency. But climate scientists also agree that, in addition, massive amounts of CO2 need to be removed from the air to meet the Paris agreement goals of keeping global temperature rise below 2C. The rock dust approach, called enhanced rock weathering (ERW), has several advantages, the researchers say. First, many farmers already add limestone dust to soils to reduce acidification, and adding other rock dust improves fertility and crop yields, meaning application could be routine and desirable. Basalt is the best rock for capturing CO2, and many mines already produce dust as a byproduct, so stockpiles already exist. The researchers also found that the world’s biggest polluters, China, the US and India, have the greatest potential for ERW, as they have large areas of cropland and relatively warm weather, which speeds up the chemical reactions. The analysis, published in the journal Nature, estimates that treating about half of farmland could capture 2bn tonnes of CO2 each year, equivalent to the combined emissions of Germany and Japan. The cost depends on local labour rates and varies from $80 per tonne in India to $160 in the US, and is in line with the $100-150 carbon price forecast by the World Bank for 2050, the date by which emissions must reach net zero to avoid catastrophic climate breakdown. “CO2 drawdown strategies that can scale up and are compatible with existing land uses are urgently required to combat climate change, alongside deep emissions cuts,” said Prof David Beerling, of the University of Sheffield, a lead author of the study. “ERW is a straightforward, practical approach.” Prof Jim Hansen, of Columbia University in the US and one of the research team, said: “Much of this carbonate will eventually [wash into] the ocean, ending up as limestone on the ocean floor. “Weathering provides a natural, permanent sink for the carbon.” Hansen, who famously warned the US Senate about global warming in 1988, said improving soil could also underpin food security for billions of people. Other proposed ways of pulling CO2 from the atmosphere at similar rates include using chemical solvents to capture it directly from the air, or growing energy crops, burning them to produce electricity and then burying the CO2 emissions. The new research suggests ERW will be less expensive than either and, unlike energy crops, does not compete with food for land. But the scientists said all approaches may be needed to beat the climate crisis. Planting trees and adding charcoal to soil also remove CO2 from the air, and these approaches could potentially be used in combination with ERW to maximise the impact. “Planting trees is an excellent option for CO2 removal but is not sufficient on its own,” said the scientists. Basalt is preferred for ERW as it contains the calcium and magnesium needed to capture CO2, as well as silica and nutrients such as potassium and iron, which are often deficient in intensively farmed soils. Some farmers in south-east Asia already use it to boost depleted silica in rice fields, while trials in the Netherlands are using it to boost tree planting. Most importantly, ERW reduces soil acidity, which already affects about 20% of arable fields around the world. Basalt is one of the most common rocks on Earth, and waste dust from mining could be used for ERW, as could waste from cement and steel manufacturing. This would remove the need to grind the rocks into fine particles, which requires energy. But how big these waste stockpiles are is unknown. “We are calling on nations to make inventories,” said Beerling. He said mines in Northumberland, UK, that produce basalt aggregate for construction produced 20-30% waste dust. But he said some mining specifically to produce basalt rock dust would probably still be needed, using existing mine capacity rather than new mines. Beerling said ERW did not require new technology, and farmers could get behind it, adding: “If you could demonstrate to farmers in China and India, for example, that they are going to get crop yield increases and get paid $100 a tonne for removing CO2, then it becomes really attractive.” Prof Johannes Lehmann, of Cornell University, and Angela Possinger, of Virginia Tech, both in the US, who were not involved in the study, wrote in a commentary on the work in Nature: “Any carbon sequestration involving soils is a formidable challenge because the technologies must be used on vast areas of land that are operated by hundreds of millions of farmers. Farmers must be fully behind such a global effort or it will fail.” They added: “Benefits to crop growth will need to be prioritised, as will financial incentives.” But they concluded that using ERW to “support soil health and crop production could emerge as our best near-term solution to the problem of removing CO2 from the atmosphere”. Beerling said that while the model used for the analysis was sophisticated, it would be important to compare its estimates with real-world experiments under way on 4ha plots in the UK, US, Australia and Malaysian Borneo, and that more research was needed on the detailed soil chemistry. “It is quite a young science,” he said."
"Robert O. Work, the veteran defense official retained as deputy secretary by President Trump, calls them his “A. I. dudes. ” The breezy moniker belies their serious task: The dudes have been a kitchen cabinet of sorts, and have advised Mr. Work as he has sought to reshape warfare by bringing artificial intelligence to the battlefield. Last spring, he asked, “O. K. you guys are the smartest guys in A. I. right?” No, the dudes told him, “the smartest guys are at Facebook and Google,” Mr. Work recalled in an interview. Now, increasingly, they’re also in China. The United States no longer has a strategic monopoly on the technology, which is widely seen as the key factor in the next generation of warfare. The Pentagon’s plan to bring A. I. to the military is taking shape as Chinese researchers assert themselves in the nascent technology field. And that shift is reflected in surprising commercial advances in artificial intelligence among Chinese companies. Last year, for example, Microsoft researchers proclaimed that the company had created software capable of matching human skills in understanding speech. Although they boasted that they had outperformed their United States competitors, a   A. I. researcher who leads a Silicon Valley laboratory for the Chinese web services company Baidu gently taunted Microsoft, noting that Baidu had achieved similar accuracy with the Chinese language two years earlier. That, in a nutshell, is the challenge the United States faces as it embarks on a new military strategy founded on the assumption of its continued superiority in technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence. First announced last year by Ashton B. Carter, President Barack Obama’s defense secretary, the “Third Offset” strategy provides a formula for maintaining a military advantage in the face of a renewed rivalry with China and Russia. Well into the 1960s, the United States held a military advantage based on technological leadership in nuclear weapons. In the 1970s, that perceived lead shifted to smart weapons, based on   Silicon Valley technologies like computer chips. Now, the nation’s leaders plan on retaining that military advantage with a significant commitment to artificial intelligence and robotic weapons. But the global technology balance of power is shifting. From the 1950s through the 1980s, the United States carefully guarded its advantage. It led the world in computer and material science technology, and it jealously hoarded its leadership with military secrecy and export controls. In the late 1980s, the emergence of the inexpensive and universally available microchip upended the Pentagon’s ability to control technological progress. Now, rather than trickling down from military and advanced corporate laboratories, today’s new technologies increasingly come from consumer electronics firms. Put simply, the companies that make the fastest computers are the same ones that put things under our Christmas trees. As consumer electronics manufacturing has moved to Asia, both Chinese companies and the nation’s government laboratories are making major investments in artificial intelligence. The advance of the Chinese was underscored last month when Qi Lu, a veteran Microsoft artificial intelligence specialist, left the company  to become chief operating officer at Baidu, where he will oversee the company’s ambitious plan to become a global leader in A. I. And last year, Tencent, developer of the mobile app WeChat, a Facebook competitor, created an artificial intelligence research laboratory and began investing in United   A. I. companies. Rapid Chinese progress has touched off a debate in the United States between military strategists and technologists over whether the Chinese are merely imitating advances or are engaged in independent innovation that will soon overtake the United States in the field. “The Chinese leadership is increasingly thinking about how to ensure they are competitive in the next wave of technologies,” said Adam Segal, a specialist in emerging technologies and national security at the Council on Foreign Relations. In August, the   China Daily reported that the country had embarked on the development of a cruise missile system with a “high level” of artificial intelligence. The new system appears to be a response to a missile the United States Navy is expected to deploy in 2018 to counter growing Chinese military influence in the Pacific. Known as the Long Range   Missile, or L. R. A. S. M. it is described as a “semiautonomous” weapon. According to the Pentagon, this means that though targets are chosen by human soldiers, the missile uses artificial intelligence technology to avoid defenses and make final targeting decisions. The new Chinese weapon typifies a strategy known as “remote warfare,” said John Arquilla, a military strategist at the Naval Post Graduate School in Monterey, Calif. The idea is to build large fleets of small ships that deploy missiles, to attack an enemy with larger ships, like aircraft carriers. “They are making their machines more creative,” he said. “A little bit of automation gives the machines a tremendous boost. ” Whether or not the Chinese will quickly catch the United States in artificial intelligence and robotics technologies is a matter of intense discussion and disagreement in the United States. Andrew Ng, chief scientist at Baidu, said the United States may be too myopic and   to understand the speed of the Chinese competition. “There are many occasions of something being simultaneously invented in China and elsewhere, or being invented first in China and then later making it overseas,” he said. “But then U. S. media reports only on the U. S. version. This leads to a misperception of those ideas having been first invented in the U. S. ” A key example of Chinese progress that goes largely unreported in the United States is Iflytek, an artificial intelligence company that has focused on speech recognition and understanding natural language. The company has won international competitions both in speech synthesis and in translation between   and   texts. The company, which Chinese technologists said has a close relationship with the government for development of surveillance technology, said it is working with the Ministry of Science and Technology on a “Humanoid Answering Robot. ” “Our goal is to send the machine to attend the college entrance examination, and to be admitted by key national universities in the near future,” said Qingfeng Liu, Iflytek’s chief executive. The speed of the Chinese technologists, compared to United States and European artificial intelligence developers, is noteworthy. Last April, Gansha Wu, then the director of Intel’s laboratory in China, left his post and began assembling a team of researchers from Intel and Google to build a   car company. Last month, the company, Uisee Technology, met its goal  —   taking a demonstration to the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas  —   after just nine months of work. “The A. I. technologies, including machine vision, sensor fusion, planning and control, on our car are completely ” Mr. Wu said. “We wrote every line by ourselves. ” Their first vehicle is intended for controlled environments like college and corporate campuses, with the ultimate goal of designing a shared fleet of autonomous taxis. The United States’ view of China’s advance may be starting to change. Last October, a White House report on artificial intelligence included several footnotes suggesting that China is now publishing more research than scholars here. Still, some scientists say the quantity of academic papers does not tell us much about innovation. And there are indications that China has only recently begun to make A. I. a priority in its military systems. “I think while China is definitely making progress in A. I. systems, it is nowhere close to matching the U. S.,” said Abhijit Singh, a former Indian military officer who is now a naval weapons analyst at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Chinese researchers who are directly involved in artificial intelligence work in China have a very different view. “It is indisputable that Chinese authors are a significant force in A. I. and their position has been increasing drastically in the past five years,” said   Lee, a   artificial intelligence researcher who played a key role in establishing both Microsoft’s and Google’s   research laboratories. Mr. Lee, now a venture capitalist who invests in both China and the United States, acknowledged that the United States is still the global leader but believes that the gap has drastically narrowed. His firm, Sinovation Ventures, has recently raised $675 million to invest in A. I. both in the United States and in China. “Using a chess analogy,” he said, “we might say that grandmasters are still largely North American, but Chinese occupy increasingly greater portions of the   A. I. scientists. ” What is not in dispute is that the close ties between Silicon Valley and China both in terms of investment and research, and the open nature of much of the American A. I. research community, has made the most advanced technology easily available to China. In addition to setting up research outposts such as Baidu’s Silicon Valley A. I. Laboratory, Chinese citizens, including government employees, routinely audit Stanford University artificial intelligence courses. One Stanford professor, Richard Socher, said it was easy to spot the Chinese nationals because after the first few weeks, his students would often skip class, choosing instead to view videos of the lectures. The Chinese auditors, on the other hand, would continue to attend, taking their seats at the front of the classroom. Artificial intelligence is only one part of the tech frontier where China is advancing rapidly. Last year, China also brought the world’s fastest supercomputer, the Sunway TaihuLight, online, supplanting another Chinese model that had been the world’s fastest. The new supercomputer is thought to be part of a broader Chinese push to begin driving innovation, a shift from its role as a manufacturing hub for components and devices designed in the United States and elsewhere. In a reflection of the desire to become a center of innovation, the processors in the new computer are of a native Chinese design. The earlier supercomputer, the Tianhe 2, was powered by Intel’s Xeon processors after it came online, the United States banned further export of the chips to China, in hopes of limiting the Chinese push into supercomputing. The new supercomputer, like similar machines anywhere in the world, has a variety of uses, and does not by itself represent a direct military challenge. It can be used to model climate change situations, for instance, or to perform analysis of large data sets. But similar advances in   computing being made by the Chinese could be used to push ahead with   research, which would have military applications, along with more typical defense functions, such as simulating nuclear weapons tests or breaking the encryption used by adversaries. Moreover, while there appear to be relatively cozy relationships between the Chinese government and commercial technology efforts, the same cannot be said about the United States. The Pentagon recently restarted its beachhead in Silicon Valley, known as the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental facility, or DIUx. It is an attempt to rethink bureaucratic United States government contracting practices in terms of the faster and more fluid style of Silicon Valley. The government has not yet undone the damage to its relationship with the Valley brought about by Edward J. Snowden’s revelations about the National Security Agency’s surveillance practices. Many Silicon Valley firms remain hesitant to be seen as working too closely with the Pentagon out of fear of losing access to China’s market. “There are smaller companies, the companies who sort of decided that they’re going to be in the defense business, like a Palantir,” said Peter W. Singer, an expert in the future of war at New America, a think tank in Washington, referring to the Palo Alto, Calif.   founded in part by the venture capitalist Peter Thiel. “But if you’re thinking about the big, iconic tech companies, they can’t become defense contractors and still expect to get access to the Chinese market. ” Those concerns are real for Silicon Valley. “No one sort of overtly says that, because the Pentagon can’t say it’s about China, and the tech companies can’t,” Mr. Singer said. “But it’s there in the background. ”"
"With the January jobs report released Friday by the Labor Department, we know that President Trump took office amid a relatively low unemployment rate (it ticked up to 4. 8 percent in January) strong job growth (227, 000 positions added that month) and weak wage growth (average hourly earnings up 0. 1 percent in January and 2. 5 percent over the past year). There was even some welcome progress in the number of people who count themselves as part of the labor force. But Mr. Trump made amply clear in his campaign that he doesn’t care for the way that government agencies and mainstream economists summarize the state of the job market. The unemployment rate, he said in December, is “totally fiction. ” He claimed at one point during the campaign that the real jobless rate was not the number below 5 percent widely cited by economists, but something like 42 percent. There is certainly a filament of truth in that. The unemployment rate counts only people who say they want a job and have looked for one in the last month  —   meaning that millions of Americans who dropped out of the labor force during the aftermath of the 2008 recession do not count as unemployed by the standard definition. But we have some exciting news for the president. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t just issue the widely cited headline unemployment rate (again, 4. 8 percent in January). This month’s jobs report, for example, offers 42 pages’ worth of figures that allow anyone who knows how to read them an infinite variety of ways to examine the labor market. No one forces you to treat the standard unemployment rate as gospel it’s just a convention, and any economic analysts worthy of their spreadsheets use a wide range of data to assess how things are going. So if the White House wants to choose a different measure of job market health to emphasize on the first Friday of every month, we’re all ears. The nice thing about a convention is you can change it. Here, in fact, is a menu of labor market measures that might be plausible alternatives to the main number  —   and why the Trump administration may, or may not, want the world to watch it. Underemployment. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes six different unemployment rates, from a relatively narrow definition to relatively broad. The jobless rate most often cited is the third of the six, known in bureaucratese as   and includes only people who say they want a job and have actively looked for one in the last month. The broadest of these unemployment rates,   also includes people who want a job but haven’t looked in the last month and people who have a   job but want   work. That rate: 9. 4 percent. Share of population not employed. If Mr. Trump really believes the 42 percent unemployment rate he floated last year is a useful measure of joblessness, here’s the math that almost gets him there. The proportion of the adult population that is working is 59. 9 percent, so the remainder of that  —   the share of American adults not working  —   was 40. 1 percent in January. Think of it as a measure of   not the more precisely defined unemployment. There are some problems with that measure. It includes people who are not working and who have no desire whatsoever to do so. It includes 17   high school students,    retirees, disabled adults and parents who voluntarily stay home with their children. Moreover, if Mr. Trump wants to focus on this measure, he may not be pleased with the results. Because the baby boom generation is hitting retirement age and voluntarily stepping out of the labor force, this measure of   is likely to rise in the years ahead. Share of   population not employed. One way to avoid the most obvious problems with that measure is simply to limit the age bracket you look at. Jordan Weissmann at Slate argues that a better   measure of the health of the job market is the share of the population between ages 25 to 54 who are working. That number was 78. 2 percent in January, so its remainder implies a 21. 8 percent jobless rate. This still isn’t perfect  —   it includes people who fall in that age bracket who have no desire to work, and also fails to include people under 25 or over 54 who really do want a job but can’t find one. But as a    measure of the health of the labor market, Mr. Weissmann is right that you could do a lot worse. Average hourly earnings. A common complaint about media focus on how many jobs are being created is that it doesn’t account for whether they are good jobs. But this is a tricky concept to measure everyone can agree that a     position is not as ideal as a highly paid computer programming gig, but it’s hard to get at more subtle differences. Is a job as a truck driver better or worse than one as a hotel assistant manager? It’s pretty subjective. What isn’t subjective is compensation. And data on average hourly earnings helps convey not just whether people are getting raises for existing jobs, but also whether the composition of jobs in the economy is shifting toward higher pay. Average hourly earnings for all private sector employees was $26 in January, and for nonmanagerial private sector employees it was $21. 84. An economy in which those numbers rise significantly faster than inflation is an economy in which   people are feeling better about the world and are seeing greater rewards for their labor. There are plenty more options for the Trump administration to consider as job market measures to emphasize. Unemployment in the construction sector (currently 9. 4 percent)? The jobless rate among people who didn’t go to college (currently 5. 8 percent)? The options are nearly endless. But  —   and this is important  —   if the president wants to set a different measure of the job market for his administration to focus on and improve, it would be best if he could let us know what it is now, so that we can really assess whether things are getting better or worse during his presidency."

An introduction to Polynyas
Guest essay by Eric Stephens
Many people think that once a sea freezes, it is one complete sheet. In reality, there are several open areas that never freeze. One such area is a polynya (common US spelling) or polynia (common UK spelling). It is a loanword from Russian: полынья (polynya), which refers to a natural ice hole, and was adopted in the 19th century by polar explorers to describe navigable portions of the sea.
Polynyas are large, persistent regions of open water and thin ice that occur within much thicker pack ice, at locations where climatologically, thick pack ice would be expected. Polynyas have a rectangular or oval aspect ratio with length scales of order 100 km; they persist with intermittent openings and closings at the same location for up to several months, and recur over many years. In contrast to polynyas, leads*another open water feature*are long, linear transient features associated with the pack ice deformation, are not restricted to a particular location, and generally have a much smaller area than polynyas.  
Polynyas can be classified into coastal and open ocean polynyas. Coastal polynyas form adjacent to a lee shore, where the winter winds advect the adjacent pack ice away from the coast, so that sea water at temperatures close to the freezing point is directly exposed to a large negative heat flux, with the resultant rapid formation of new ice.
Coastal polynyas are produced in the Antarctic by katabatic winds
This new ice is advected away from the coast as fast as it forms. For these polynyas, a typical along shore length is 100 – 500km; a typical offshore length is 10 – 100 km.
In contrast, the less common open ocean polynyas have characteristic diameters of 100km and are driven by the upwelling of warm ocean water, which maintains a large opening in the pack ice. Because the atmospheric heat loss from the open-ocean polynyas goes into cooling of the water column, they are sometimes called ‘sensible heat’ polynyas; because the heat loss from coastal polynyas goes into ice growth, they are called ‘latent heat’ polynyas. Finally, some polynyas, notably the North Water polynya in Baffin Bay, are maintained by both upwelling and ice advection.

Open ocean polynyas are self-maintaining, in that as heat is lost to the atmosphere at the surface, the surface water becomes denser and sinks, driving future convection. The convection ceases when the atmosphere warms in spring, or if sufficient fresh water, either produced locally by melting, or advected into the region, places a low-salinity cap on the convection
In the winter Canadian Arctic, because the marine mammals living under the ice need breathing holes, these mammals tend to concentrate in the polynya regions. For example, the North Water contains large concentrations of white whales, narwhals, walruses, and seals, with polar bears foraging along the coast. Also, the major winter bird colonies in the Canadian islands are located adjacent to polynyas.

Polynyas are persistent openings in the ice cover that in winter ventilate the warm ocean directly to the cold atmosphere. The major physical importance of the coastal polynyas is due to their large production of ice and brine, where the resultant dense water contributes to various Arctic, Antarctic, and North Pacific water masses.

During the cold war the location of polynyas were classified as secret, because the Subs from both sides would use them to surface.
When submarines of the U.S. Navy made expeditions to the North Pole in the 1950s and 60s, there was a significant concern about surfacing through the thick pack ice of the Arctic Ocean. In 1962, both the USS Skate and USS Seadragon surfaced within the same, large polynya near the North Pole, for the first polar rendezvous of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet and the U.S. Pacific Fleet
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynya
In January 2013 the media was reporting a pod of orcas were trapped in the ice in Hudson Bay. With headlines such as: “Little hope for killer whales trapped by ice in Hudson’s Bay”. Some people were calling for the government to send an ice breaker to rescue them. Just when the media had given up hope – they disappeared.
The truth was they were at a polynya. There are several known and studied polynya fields in the eastern side Hudson Bay, with the Belcher Islands being one. From there they can swim under the ice to other polynyas in the Hudson Strait.
Some notes:
Polynyas give off a lot of heat to the atmosphere. For example the area surrounding the polynya can be cloudy, but over the polynya it will be clear.

In Antarctica many mainland penguin colonies are located near places where annual polynyas are known to recur, as there is a guaranteed source of food for the nesting penguins. There has been some concern that with increased sea ice around Antarctica that the penguins would be in danger, because they have to walk further. This is not a concern because they use polynyas.
This blog found some open water where they were to drill. Instead of blaming AGW/ CAGW etc. he correctly said it was a polynya.

This is just an introduction to polynyas as the title says. There is much more available on the net such as thermodynamics of polynyas – how they cool the water. Also there are many pictures of them.

From the American Meteorological Society
A risk management framework improves health systems’ resilience to high-impact weather
WASHINGTON — April 29, 2014 – According to a new study by the American Meteorological Society (AMS) Policy Program, a risk management framework can improve the resilience of healthcare facilities and services to high-impact weather such as tornadoes and hurricanes. The report is based on a recent AMS Policy Program workshop, A Prescription for the 21st Century: Improving Resilience to High-Impact Weather for Healthcare Facilities and Services, held in Washington, DC in October 2013.

The purpose of the study was to explore methods for improving the resilience of the health system. The report outlines a process for reducing the structural and operational risks that healthcare facilities often face. The study presents a systematic strategy for improving resilience through a three-step process that first seeks to understand risks, then addresses the vulnerabilities of health facilities, and finally prepares for the continuity of health services in the event of disruptions.
The AMS Policy Program workshop included many diverse and engaged parties. The insurance sector and healthcare accreditors represented the stakeholders who assess risk. Those who plan and construct hospitals were represented by land developers, building engineers, and urban designers. Discussions on the continuity of healthcare services addressed pharmaceutical supplies, health IT, and clinical services.
“Two of our key findings involve new concepts,” Shalini Mohleji, Policy Fellow at the AMS Policy Program and director of the study, said. “First, resilience can be increased through successful risk management, and second, redundant systems promote efficacy, not inefficiency.”
Healthcare facilities and services provide a key foundation for a thriving community. Therefore, ensuring their resilience to high-impact weather is critical. High-impact weather events present a challenge in that they disrupt health facilities and services and decrease the ability to provide healthcare at a time when a community’s needs increase due to injuries and illness associated with the event. As more communities will emerge in areas vulnerable to high-impact weather, the need will grow for resilient healthcare facilities and services.
“Our health facilities are too vulnerable to weather and climate events. We need to protect them more effectively and a comprehensive framework to assess and manage risk can help do that.” said Paul Higgins, Director of the AMS Policy Program.

It’s rather peculiar: None of the IPCC climate models projected the warming pause of the last 17 years. An real embarrassment.
Scientist Stefan Rahmstorf was devastated, and so publicly disputed that there even was a pause at all. Naturally this strategy cannot be successful over the long run. Then on April 23, 2015, a team of scientists lead by Matthew England published an article in Nature Climate Change, whose title finally and officially conceded the warming pause:
Robust warming projections despite the recent hiatus.”
The abstract reads:
The hiatus in warming has led to questions about the reliability of long-term projections, yet here we show they are statistically unchanged when considering only ensemble members that capture the recent hiatus. This demonstrates the robust nature of twenty-first century warming projections.
A wonderful strategy: 95% of all models are wrong (see the following figure from Roy Spencer), so simply take the remaining 5% of the models and, with them a single stroke of the pen, declare them “robust” and reliable in their ability to forecast. A real joke.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal warming science nemesis Steve McIntyre of the solid Climate Audit site calls the new paper by Rahmstorf and Mann making claims about Atlantic Ocean currents based on proxies rather than on measurements “much worse than we thought.”
Hat-tip: Reader BruceC
Rarely does one see science get so harshly criticized.
“Dreck” in peer-reviewed literature
One problem, McIntyre writes, is that Rahmstorf’s and Mann’s results are not based on proxies for Atlantic current velocity, but on a network consisting of iffy proxy series which are “statistically indistinguishable from white noise“. McIntyre comments: “It’s hard to understand why anyone would seriously believe (let alone publish in peer reviewed literature) that Atlantic ocean currents could be reconstructed by such dreck...”.
Obviously Rahmstorf and Mann are unable to come to terms with the results derived from real observed data, and thus feel compelled to create another reality based of very fuzzy, indirect data that can be interpreted as desired.
“Balderdash” getting by peer-review process

So how does “dreck” end up getting published in journals? McIntyre quotes Andrew Weaver:
They let these random diatribes of absolute, incorrect nonsense get published. They’re not able to determine if what’s being said is correct or not, or whether it’s just absolute balderdash.” […].
The reputable climate science community should collectively cringe with embarrassment.”
The Canadian statistics expert also writes that the proxies that Mann and Rahmstorf used “do not contain any useful information on the past history of the AMOC.”
McIntyre ends by assigning readers little homework. The answers aren’t that tough.

I think an investigation needs to be launched to determine why taxpayer money is being spent on creating such rubbish. Taxpayers have the right to get answers.

"For residents of Tucson in southern Arizona, the Santa Catalina Mountains in the Coronado national forest are known as a hub for hiking, mountain biking and other outdoor recreation. But on 5 June lightning ignited a wildfire that has grown to engulf over 118,000 acres. The fires are still only 58% contained. Called the Bighorn fire, it is the eighth-biggest in state history, and it has transformed the Catalinas into a hub for the study of the impacts of climate change. Nasa satellite photos show large scar marks left by the fire.  “At night you can see basically the outline of the fire on the mountain,” said Courtney Slanaker, the executive director for the American Red Cross Southern Arizona, “and then during the daytime you’re seeing that heavy smoke as it moves through different fuel sources on the mountain.” And yet, Bighorn is just one of three fires that sit in the top 10 biggest wildfires in Arizona history. The Bush fire in the Tonto national forest, about 30 miles from Phoenix, now covers 193,000 acres and 98% is contained. It is the fifth-biggest in state history. Meanwhile, the Mangum fire burning in the Kaibab national forest now covers over 71,000 acres and 67% contained. The trio of fires are bigger than Washington DC, San Francisco, Baltimore, Chicago, Miami, Minneapolis and Manhattan combined. Despite the fires’ enormous size, only one home has suffered serious structural damage. For the Bighorn fire, Mike DeVries, the incident command team public information officer, said it was too early to relax. “Sometimes you’re just one change in conditions away from having another round of fires,” he said. “All may look well with a fire and then another day arrives and it changes.” Amber Soja, a scientist at Nasa who studies the links between climate change and wildfires, recently referred to the Bush fire as an “extreme fire” due to the elevation at which the fire burned and the weather which fueled it. In June, Arizona saw regular daily temperatures of 105-110F. And little rain has fallen so far this summer, despite 15 June marking the start of the state’s official monsoon season. “This is extreme heat and drought,” Soja said in a video published by Nasa. Beyond the three major fires, eight others in Arizona are either still burning or were recently contained. One of them, the Blue River fire, is over 30,000 acres and 85% contained, burning on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. Another, the Wood Springs 2 fire, now covers nearly 9,000 acres of the Navajo Nation and is only 5% contained. Both of those fires, like the Bighorn fire, ignited via lightning strikes according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group. The wildfires come as tribal nations and Arizona face an uptick in Covid-19 cases. The Navajo Nation has the highest per-capita infection rate in the US, while Arizona currently faces an infection rate of over 28% of those tested. Recent scientific studies examining England and Italy have linked Covid-19 morbidity to poor air quality of the likes yielded by wildfire smoke. Satellite video published by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) shows that at the peak of the Bighorn fire, smoke was visible from 23,000 miles away. And data from a shared Nasa/Noaa satellite pointed to smoke seen from the Bush fire stretching 63 miles from its center. The Navajo Nation issued a smoke advisory warning on 1 July, urging all residents to “take precautions to protect their health from the wildfire smoke” coming from the Wood Springs 2 Fire. The tribe stated exposure to wildfire smoke could lead to an “increase[d] risk of Covid-19 and other respiratory infections” or worsen symptoms in infected patients. This reality has forced emergency responders to adjust accordingly. DeVries, of Bighorn fire incident command team, said firefighters follow US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol for wildfire relief workers. Slanaker, of the American Red Cross, said the agency had adopted social distancing protocols as part of its relief plan, partnering with the tourism booster group Visit Tucson to secure discounts on hotel rooms for those in need if forced to evacuate. “This is an unprecedented season for us. And while we’re still responding to different fires, they’re not going to take a break for Covid,” said Slanaker. “So, we’ve had to deal with those complexities, and make adjustments.” Those adjustments include reduced staff, mandatory masks and social distancing protocols in evacuation intake centers, as well as offering prescreening and testing for Covid-19 for clients and staff. The distancing takes a toll for those affected by the fires, Slanaker said. “A lot of folks that volunteer with us are incredibly compassionate and empathetic people, and to not be able to go up [to survivors] and give a hug and say, ‘Hey, we’re gonna get you through this, we’re here to support you,’ is really challenging,” she said. “You don’t have that personal touch any more and so you have to find other ways to provide comfort and care, while still implementing those social distancing measures.”"
"Around 66m years ago, a giant asteroid struck the Earth, causing the extinction of the dinosaurs, ammonites, and many other species. The asteroid was equally devastating at a microscopic level, driving ocean plankton to near-extinction. This crippled the base of the marine food chain and shut down important ocean functions, such as the absorption and delivery of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean floor. Given the real threat of a sixth mass extinction event brought about by human-caused climate breakdown and habitat disruption, we wanted to find out how long the ocean ecosystem took to reboot after the last one. What we found has grave implications for the long-term outlook of marine ecosystems should we tip the critical base of its food chain over the threshold of extinction.

      Earth's sixth mass extinction has begun, new study confirms


 The nannoplankton almost totally wiped out 66m years ago – also known as coccolithophores – are now widespread once more in the sunlit upper oceans. Although roughly 100 times smaller than a grain of sand, they are so abundant that they are visible from space as swirling blooms in the ocean surface. When these microscopic plankton die, they leave behind exquisite armoured exoskeletons known as coccospheres made from the mineral calcite, composed of bonded calcium and carbon. Along with the dead plankton cells, these skeletons slowly fall to the ocean floor, forming a muddy calcium and carbon-rich sediment. As this sediment compacts, it forms chalk and limestone, leaving us with iconic landscapes such as white chalk cliffs – the shallow sea floor of a forgotten age, since lifted up by tectonic activity. Conserved within this compacted sediment is a continuous fossil record stretching back 220m years. It is this fossil record – the most abundant on the planet – that can tell us how ecosystems responded to the extinction of nannoplankton. Changes in the diversity and abundance of the plankton that once lived in the ocean above reflect the environmental changes that played out in the millennia after the giant asteroid hit.

      Sea plankton shells hold key to millions of years of climate data


 We extracted a continuous core of deep-sea sediment from the Pacific Ocean. For the first 13m years after the mass extinction event, we took a sample of the fossil record at intervals of 13,000 years. We measured fossil abundance, diversity and cell sizes from over 700,000 specimens, producing probably the largest fossil dataset ever produced from a single site. These fossil data revealed that the plant-like, photosynthetic plankton bounced back almost immediately - probably within a few thousand years after the mass extinction. However, the earliest communities were highly unstable and made up of just a handful of species with unusually small cell sizes, as the figure above shows. While the calcite skeletons of larger plankton cells can sink to the sea floor, the skeletons of these smaller organisms descend much less often, instead getting “recycled” in the upper ocean by hungry plankton. Communities with larger cell sizes were not reestablished until two million years later, restoring their critical transfer of carbon to the ocean floor to pre-extinction levels. By this time, the number of different plankton species had also increased. This  genetic diversity allowed them to expand into a greater range of ocean habitats, providing greater resilience to environmental change, and a secure foundation at the base of the ocean food web.  This stability then supported expansion in the abundance and diversity of larger plankton, fish, mammals, and birds dependent on these food sources. But although stable and resilient ecosystems had returned by two million years after the mass extinction, it took a further eight million years for species numbers to fully recover to their previous levels. Today’s marine ecosystems are still just as dependent on the plankton at their base as they were in the past. Studies show that populations of modern-day plankton have already declined by as much as 40%, and that 70% of species are migrating towards the poles. We still don’t fully understand how plankton species might finally be driven to extinction, but the fossil record shows us that extinction is strongly shaped by climate change. If we carry on emitting carbon and interfering with marine ecosystems, we run the risk of losing one of its critical carbon-storing and food-providing players. Research shows that that could take nature millions of years to reverse.  Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable. Our response to it isn’t."
"For someone who promoted his management skills and campaigned as an “organizational genius,” as Anderson Cooper of CNN put it, it has been a rocky White House debut for Donald J. Trump, the first president to go directly from the executive suite to the Oval Office. “Chaos” seems to be the word most often invoked, closely followed by “turmoil. ” (One exception: the White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, who said he preferred “ . ”) In less than two weeks, Mr. Trump created upheaval at the nation’s borders, alienated longtime allies, roiled markets with talk of a trade war and prompted some of the largest protests any president has faced. The conservative editorial page of The Wall Street Journal bemoaned a refugee policy “so poorly explained and prepared for, that it has produced confusion and fear at airports, an immediate legal defeat, and political fury at home and abroad. ” Even the top House Republican, Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who had released a statement praising the immigration order, later distanced himself, saying, “It’s regrettable that there was some confusion with the rollout. ” All new presidents undergo a learning curve. But Mr. Trump promised a seamless transition and, with a real chief executive in charge as opposed to a career politician, an administration that would function as a   machine. So it doesn’t seem premature to ask some leading management experts for an assessment of Mr. Trump’s first weeks, purely from the viewpoint of organizational behavior and management effectiveness, as I did this week. The unanimous verdict: Thus far, the Trump administration is a textbook case of how not to run a complex organization like the executive branch. “This is so basic, it’s covered in the introduction to the M. B. A. program that all our students take,” said Lindred Greer, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. By all outward indications, Mr. Trump “desperately needs to take the course,” she said. Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford and the author of “Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don’t,” said Mr. Trump’s executive actions as president “are so far from any responsible management approach” that they all but defy analysis. “Of course, this isn’t new,” he told me. “His campaign also violated every prudent management principle. Everyone including our friends on Wall Street somehow believed that once he was president he’d change. I don’t understand that logic. ” Wall Street did take notice. After months of cheering the prospect of tax reform and infrastructure spending, investors sold stocks after a weekend of chaos at the nation’s airports connected to the president’s executive order on immigration. On Monday, the Dow industrials experienced the biggest   decline since the election, fueled by worries that a dysfunctional White House wouldn’t be able to execute Mr. Trump’s policies. “If you thought immigration was bad, just wait for health care,” Mr. Pfeffer warned. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. There is an enormous amount of literature and data exploring what constitutes effective management of complicated organizations. “The core principles have served many leaders really well,” said Jeffrey T. Polzer, professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School. “It’s really common sense: You want to surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise, who bring different perspectives to the issue at hand. Then you foster debate and invite different points of view in order to reach a   solution. ” This is often easier said than done. It “requires an openness to being challenged, and some   and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do,” Mr. Polzer continued. “This doesn’t mean decisions are made by consensus. The person at the top makes the decisions, but based on the facts and expertise necessary to make a good decision. ” Mr. Trump has already violated several of these core principles. The secretary of Homeland Security, John F. Kelly, was still discussing a proposed executive order restricting immigration when Mr. Trump went ahead and signed it. Nor was Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, consulted he saw the final order only hours before it went into effect. Not to consult thoroughly with top cabinet officers before deciding on the order “is insane,” since they “have the expertise and should be on top of the data,” Ms. Greer said. “Ignoring them leads to bad decisions and is also incredibly demoralizing. ” And there’s another reason to consult, Mr. Polzer said: “When people are genuinely involved in a decision and their input is heard and valued and respected, they are more likely to support and buy into the decision and be motivated to execute to the best of their abilities, even if the decision doesn’t go their way. ” Conversely, people who aren’t consulted feel they have no stake in a successful outcome. Far from encouraging and weighing differing views as part of the   process, Mr. Trump appears to view dissension as disloyalty. After career State Department officers circulated a draft cable questioning the effectiveness of the immigration ban, Mr. Spicer responded, “They should either get with the program or they can go. ” “Debate and dissent are essential to reaching any thoughtful outcome,” Ms. Greer said. Comments like Mr. Spicer’s “will discourage anyone from speaking up. You end up with group think, an echo chamber where people only say what they think the president wants to hear. ” And while it’s understandable that the president was eager to act swiftly to follow through on his campaign promises  —   he had made a long list of actions to be carried out on “Day 1”  —   his directives came across as needlessly hasty and poorly thought through. Some had to be reframed (talk of a Mexican border surcharge) or significantly modified and clarified after the fact (immigration policy). I asked the management experts to ignore their views about the merits of Mr. Trump’s policies, but all said that execution and substance are inextricably linked. “When you’re on the receiving end of a policy decision, the merits of the decision and the execution go hand in hand,” Mr. Polzer said. “If either one is done poorly, the outcomes will be bad. Even good plans that are poorly rolled out aren’t going to work well. ” For many people, the Affordable Care Act was indelibly tainted by the computer malfunctions that plagued its start. Similarly, for many Americans, the enduring image of Mr. Trump’s immigration policy will be that of a tearful Iraqi immigrant who was detained at Kennedy International Airport after risking his life working as a translator for the American military over a   period. (He was released after lawyers intervened on his behalf.) That prompted even Mr. Ryan to say, “No one wanted to see people with green cards or special immigrant visas, like translators, get caught up in all of this. ” Some Trump defenders have said that the president thrives on chaos, and it has proved to be an effective management approach for him in the past. But every expert I consulted said there is no empirical data or research that supports the notion that chaos is a productive management tool. “I’m not aware of anyone who advocates that,” Mr. Polzer said. “I don’t really know what’s going on in the White House, so I don’t feel comfortable commenting on that specifically. But I can say in general that in organizational settings, less chaos is a good thing. ” Everyone agreed that there was still time for Mr. Trump to right the ship. Other administrations have had course corrections and personnel  . But having to reorganize only weeks into a first term is not promising. If this were the private sector, “someone would be fired,” Ms. Greer said. That seems highly unlikely, since Mr. Trump has not even acknowledged a problem, instead blaming the media for an impression of upheaval in the White House. That is a fundamental problem, Mr. Pfeffer said. “No good business makes decisions that are based on falsehoods,” he said. “My sense is that Trump takes no one’s counsel but his own. That’s bad management, period. ”"

One of the strangest things about liberals is how they think getting arrested is some kind of achievement. Take Jane Fonda, who at the tender age of 81 is still ranting against capitalist America ruining the world. Only this time, the issue is “climate change” instead of the Cold War.



 **“Hanoi Jane”** infamously sat behind a communist anti-aircraft gun in Vietnam in 1972, and today, one could imagine her aiming her big gun at commercial aircraft ruining the planet with their notorious carbon emissions.



Naturally, liberal journalists are delighted. _The Hollywood Reporter_ just gushed over her third arrest on Capitol Hill on October 26, this time with the actor Ted Danson. They included a pile of happy play-by-play tweets (including video tweets) by Hannah Jewell of _The Washington Post._ Hannah seemed to be on a first-name basis with the socialist actress.



– “Jane just asked a group of very buttoned up college kids on a capitol visit if they wanted to join her. Ted Danson added that getting arrested ‘sharpens the mind’.” [Insert laugh track here.]



– “‘When I turned 70 I thought ok, time to rest on my laurels’ says Ted… ‘and then I met Jane Fonda’. He calls her his mentor. ‘Here I am about to get arrested.’”



– “Ted Danson just shared a little handcuffed high five (high ten?) with Jane Fonda”.



– “Jane gets patted down and shouts ‘Ted, are ya having fun yet?!’”



This is nothing but an exercise in political vanity. Getting arrested sounds all naughty and risky – but there are no risks. The Capitol Police does not allow demonstrations on the Capitol grounds without a permit, so these leftists come unauthorized and play Martin Luther King for a day. Unauthorized, but not unannounced. Press attention (and adulation) is everything, so make sure everyone knows they’re coming. Protesters are put in single-use plastic handcuffs and usually taken to the Capitol Police garage and processed. Fonda isn’t sitting in jail over the weekend. No one’s fining her $1,000 for the trouble.



When Fonda was first arrested, on October 14, the network morning shows were predictable stenographers to leftist protest.



On _Today,_ NBC’s Dylan Dreyer oozed: “Fonda, who has a long history of political activism, has dubbed this ‘Fire Drill Fridays.’…She’s still keeping busy, 81 years old.” NBC White House reporter Peter Alexander chimed in: “Yeah, lending her celebrity to the cause. That’s great.”



On _CBS This Morning,_ Saturday co-host Michelle Miller proclaimed: “Oscar-winning actress and long-time activist Jane Fonda is hoping her latest role will make a lasting impression. Fonda was one of 16 people arrested outside the U.S. Capitol Friday while peacefully protesting climate change.” CBS quoted Fonda calling the state of the warming planet “A collective crisis that demands collective action.”



This is not an actual demonstration of science. Jewell quoted Fonda: “There was a time when there was no plastic, and we did just fine.” Then Jewell added: “Plastic was invented before she was born, but popularized in the 1960s I believe.”



ScienceHistory.org says the first fully synthetic plastic was invented in 1907, and became widely utilized in World War II. The Left began _protesting_ plastics in the Sixties, so that’s how liberal millennials at _The Washington Post_ guess it all started.



Science isn’t really the point. Passing a “Green New Deal” that takes over what remains of American capitalism is the point. Left-wing radicals haven’t changed their authoritarian agenda one bit since their glory days rooting against America in Vietnam. Jane Fonda is the same self-absorbed dilettante that she was in 1972…and she’s still celebrated for it.



But here’s a red brick of reality: It ain’t working. The purpose of this form of political activism is to create a national movement supporting and emulating it. All the media adulation aside, the public doesn’t care what these two old people, with all their expensive plastic surgeries, are doing. Jane got arrested. Nothing. She got herself re-arrested. Nothing. She brought in Ted. Double nothing.



What a waste of good plastic.

Groucho Marx’s famous truism that “politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies” missed one key element: **“and making things worse than they were”**. In the case of climate change alarmism: much, much worse.



The pigtailed ignoramus saint of the climate cult screeches that “people are dying”, but either ignores or is too stupid to realise that if people **are** dying, it’s because of the destructive policies she and her puppet masters espouse. As [already reported at ](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/yes-greta-people-are-dying-you-your-friends-are-killing-them/)_[The BFD](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/yes-greta-people-are-dying-you-your-friends-are-killing-them/)_ , thousands of people died in Britain last year because of “energy poverty” caused by climate policies.



Japanese are suffering at the hands of similar knee-jerk policies.



Shutting down Japan’s nuclear power plants has caused thousands of people to die in the cold, far more than were harmed from the Fukushima nuclear disaster itself, according to research that warns against decisions based on the precautionary principle.



Despite its terrifying image, nuclear power has an extraordinary record of safety. Even accounting for the unmitigated horror of the single worst nuclear accident at Chernobyl, nuclear still ranks as one of the safest energy sources known to humanity. But who needs facts when there’s some good scaremongering to be had?



After a tsunami hit the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear reactor in 2011, the Japanese government closed down the nation’s nuclear industry amid a wave of public anxiety about the energy source, causing an increase in electricity prices by as much as 38 per cent.



“The increase in mortality from the higher electricity prices significantly outweighs the mortality­ from the accident itself­, suggesting the decision to cease nuclear production caused more harm than good,” the author­s conclude, putting the number of deaths at about 4500 over three years to 2014.



“No deaths have yet to be attributable to radiation exposure (from Fukushima), though projections estimate a cumulative 130 deaths since.”



As for the Greens and their idiotic “precautionary principle”:



The study, by economists at the universities of Columbia and Nagoya, criticises the precau­tio­n­ary principle, which dictates taking steps, however extreme, to avoid outcomes, such as catastro­p­hic climate change, that are poorly understood. “A major concern with this principle is that by focusing solely on the risk from action, it fails to consider the risk from the alternative,” it says.



In her second-most disastrous knee-jerk decision, German chancellor Angela Merkel also shut down that country’s nuclear industry. Germany is sliding back to burning coal, usually dirty, inefficient brown coal. In Isaac Asimov’s _Foundation_ , such a reversion from nuclear to “burning coal and oil” is a sure sign of sliding into barbarism.



The authors suggest the decis­ion to switch off nuclear power was **“based on emotion and instinct rather than reason and rationality”.**



No kidding.

"Decades before President Trump nominated him to be labor secretary, Andrew Puzder went to battle with federal labor regulators in a Las Vegas courtroom. The year was 1983, and Mr. Puzder was working at a law firm owned by a famous mob lawyer and casino owner whom the Labor Department accused of squandering $25 million from his union workers’ pension funds on sham investments. It fell to Mr. Puzder to lead the defense, which he framed in aggressively antigovernment terms. In his opening statement, Mr. Puzder told the jury it was not his boss’s fault for not paying back the money  —   it was overzealous regulators in Washington who had killed off a good business deal by intervening before his investments could succeed, he said. “We should not be required to pay for the mistakes of the Department of Labor” and the union, Mr. Puzder said, according to The Las Vegas  . The jury did not buy it. Mr. Puzder’s boss, Morris A. Shenker, was hit with a $34 million judgment and filed for bankruptcy. More than three decades later, the lawyers who represented the Labor Department in the case recall Mr. Puzder as bright and capable, but they still marvel that he blamed government regulators. “I personally find there is some irony in him being nominated to be the secretary of labor,” said Daly D. E. Temchine, the lead lawyer in the case for the Department of Labor. “Back then, he represented a guy who thought it was O. K. to screw his employees. ” As it turned out, Mr. Puzder’s arguments in the case foreshadowed positions he would take after leaving the practice of law to become chief executive of a   company. He has repeatedly argued that labor regulations stifle economic growth. He has indicated his preference for machines over people because they do not take time off or file lawsuits. And a recording recently surfaced of him referring to his employees as “the best of the worst. ” Because he was a lawyer representing a client, the positions that Mr. Puzder took in the case do not necessarily represent his personal views. But Mr. Shenker was more than just a client: He was also Mr. Puzder’s first boss, one he chose to work for, an associate said, specifically because it gave him the chance to litigate this case and a second similar one. Mr. Puzder declined to comment for this article, but upon nominating him in December, Mr. Trump said Mr. Puzder would “fight to make American workers safer” and “save small businesses from the crushing burdens of unnecessary regulations that are stunting job growth. ” Worker advocates have opposed Mr. Puzder’s nomination, citing lawsuits that workers filed against CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, as well as wage violations at those restaurants. Mr. Puzder is chief executive of CKE. His confirmation hearing before a Senate committee has been delayed four times. His spokesman said Mr. Puzder, 66, was working to divest from his company. “He doesn’t view laws and regulations as things that help protect the most vulnerable from exploitation. He looks at them as things that hinder him from doing what he wants to do,” said Judy Conti, who oversees federal advocacy for the National Employment Law Project. “That’s antithetical to the mission of the Department of Labor. ” Mr. Shenker led a life fit for the movies. A Jew, he fled Russia as an orphaned teenager in the 1920s to join his older brothers in St. Louis. He went on to become one of the   lawyers in America. He was also a mob lawyer. In his thick accent, Mr. Shenker sometimes said he would rather see a guilty man go free than an innocent man go to jail. But his work on behalf of organized crime figures went beyond the courtroom. Through one of his most notorious clients, the former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, Mr. Shenker gained influence in the   over the Teamsters’ enormous Central States pension fund. According to an investigation by Life magazine, Mr. Shenker built a fortune from fees he was paid to   loans from the fund to businesses. In 1973, he took control of the Dunes Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and a resort in California. Married and supporting two children, Mr. Puzder began working at the Shenker law firm while a   student at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis, finding it more attractive than the construction work he had been doing to earn money. Mr. Puzder joined the firm full time after graduating in 1978, a career choice that bewildered some who knew him. The firm was fading in relevance, with its famous principal spending much of his time in Las Vegas. But Peter Sadowski, who worked part time at the firm with Mr. Puzder while both were in law school, said Mr. Shenker had enticed Mr. Puzder with the chance to handle the   lawsuit already underway in Las Vegas. “Shenker wanted him to lead the defense,” said Mr. Sadowski, now an executive vice president at Fidelity National Financial, a major seller of title insurance. Politico recently reported on Mr. Puzder’s work for Mr. Shenker. Mr. Shenker’s fortunes had changed quickly after Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which, among other things, protects worker pensions from being raided by their employers. The next year, the Teamsters pension fund backed out of a $40 million loan that Mr. Shenker wanted for an expansion of the Dunes. Mr. Shenker sued, and the Labor Department joined the case with the pension fund. In 1980, after a federal judge summarily dismissed the case halfway through the trial, Mr. Puzder presented the appeal at the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, arguing, in part, that the loan was promised before the new law took effect. In court filings, Labor Department lawyers described Mr. Puzder’s efforts as “a vigorous but futile attempt to backpedal, sidestep, and otherwise avoid the absolute barriers” of the pension protection act known as Erisa. The appellate judges denied Mr. Puzder’s appeal. By then, another spigot of union pension money had gone dry. The pension fund for the culinary workers union in Las Vegas had been extending loans to Mr. Shenker with no restrictions since 1973. A new pension fund chairman  —   Richard P. Crane, a former federal prosecutor  —   was appointed in 1976 and concluded that the Shenker loans were “a total  . ” He insisted on all but shutting down the flow of money. “Shenker went nuts,” Mr. Crane recalled. In 1977, the Labor Department sued Mr. Shenker, accusing him of failing to repay the $24. 9 million it said he had illegally borrowed from the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Trust. The total represented more than half of the trust’s assets. The case proceeded slowly. During a 1982 hearing of the Senate committee that oversees labor, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, accused the Labor Department of “blatantly coddling” Mr. Shenker for years. Labor officials saw the case as an early test of using Erisa to rid unions of corruption. Seven lawyers were sent to Las Vegas from Washington. For Mr. Shenker, repaying the money would have threatened his financial survival. Mr. Puzder, then 32, and a colleague from the Shenker firm, E. Michael Murphy, left St. Louis for Las Vegas. As he stood to make a point in the trial’s opening days, the months of grueling preparation caught up with Mr. Puzder: He promptly collapsed to the floor, fainting in front of judge and jury. After regaining his composure, he attacked government regulators, claiming they had a “vendetta” against his boss. “Some people in the Department of Labor were more concerned with pursuing Shenker than they were with recovering the trust’s money,” Mr. Puzder said, according to The Las Vegas Sun. He argued that Mr. Shenker was financially harmed when the pension fund stopped making payments on a loan extension in 1977. He said the Shenker investments had been well on their way to becoming successful. The federal judge, Roger D. Foley, was unimpressed, at one point saying that the money appeared to have gone down “a rathole. ” The specter of organized crime hung over the trial. Tapes of a 1979 meeting between Mr. Shenker and two mob figures  —   Joey (The Clown) Lombardo and Allen Dorfman, a   liaison between the mob and Hoffa’s Teamsters union  —   revealed Mr. Dorfman complaining that Mr. Shenker had failed to pay him kickbacks on millions in loans that Mr. Shenker had procured from the Teamsters. Newspapers covering Mr. Lombardo’s 1983 sentencing hearing splashed the incriminating transcripts across their pages. The government was determined to reduce the Shenker case to its most basic elements. “In my opening statement to the jury, I said, ‘You may hear a lot from the defense about how complicated this is, but it’s simple,’” Mr. Temchine said. “‘He borrowed a thousand bucks from each member and promised to give it back, with interest. He didn’t. ’” The jurors agreed. After the   trial, Mr. Shenker was required to repay all the money he had borrowed, plus interest, for a total of $34 million. “I think he’s too good a con man for me to mix with,” one juror told The Las Vegas Sun. “I’d be like the pension fund. I’d lose on the deal. ” Months later, Mr. Shenker filed for bankruptcy, citing $184 million in obligations. About that time, Mr. Puzder and Mr. Murphy left his firm, which limped along until Mr. Shenker was indicted on bankruptcy and tax fraud charges in 1989. He died later that year. During the bankruptcy case, government lawyers were able to extract $26 million for the pension fund, Mr. Temchine said. At least one time as a lawyer, Mr. Puzder was on the other side of such a case, helping to represent the interests of a police pension fund that had been defrauded by its investment managers. His team argued that the managers were essentially stealing from the widows of police officers. At his labor secretary confirmation hearing, one challenge senators may choose to take up is determining whether Mr. Puzder ultimately favors protecting workers, or executives like himself and his old boss. In a surprising turn, that confirmation hearing could place Mr. Puzder face to face with Mr. Hatch, the senator who once said the Labor Department had been going soft on Mr. Shenker at the same time Mr. Puzder claimed the department had been unfairly tough. Almost 35 years later, Mr. Hatch still sits on that committee. And while he praised Mr. Puzder in December as someone who “will bring invaluable expertise to the Department of Labor,” he may well be reminded of the time he scolded a Labor Department official in front of his fellow lawmakers. “I am still not sure,” Mr. Hatch said at the time, “if some of you understand the enormity of the problem that these actions by Mr. Shenker and the Labor Department’s poor oversight have caused the 30, 000 workers covered by this pension fund. ”"

Poor young St Greta, she has ended up on the wrong side of the Atlantic after those inconsiderate Chileans cancelled the climate talkfest and Spain agreed to host the next taxpayer-funded junket trip for the faithful on the wrong side of the Atlantic.



At least she is, sort of, being true to her creed, but in so doing shows what a stupid idea this ‘no-fly’ mantra really is. Any normal person would quickly make an online booking change and get on with life. But not St Greta; she tweeted,



As #COP25 has officially been moved from Santiago to Madrid I’ll need some help. 



It turns out I’ve travelled half around the world, the wrong way.



Now I need to find a way to cross the Atlantic in November … If anyone could help me find transport I would be so grateful.



So how to return? As always, _The BFD_ is here to help: 



Take a balloon. Obviously not heated with evil natural gas, but there should be plenty of bio-fuel woodchips she can use, after all, they send shiploads of them to the UK to burn in a carbon-friendly way.



Find some carbon-neutral propellant for a long-range version of this?



Buy a second-hand one of these?



Golly gosh, it is even solar-powered. What more could a girl want?



This set should be cheap enough …



Maybe a bit too much dependence on petroleum-based products, though.



C’mon team, add your suggestions in the comments, **we need to save St Greta**. 



Oh, silly me, never mind – she can walk back …

"**The head of human resources at sportswear giant Adidas has resigned amid a row over the firm's corporate culture and lack of diversity.**
Karen Parkin is a British citizen who had worked at Adidas for more than 20 years.
Her exit follows protests by Adidas staff over a comment she reportedly made at an internal meeting last year.
Global brands face increasing pressure to take action over racial equality after the death of George Floyd.
In a statement issued by the worldâs second largest sportswear maker Ms Parkin said that she had always stood against racism and had âdecided to retire and pave the way for change.â
According to the Wall Street Journal, earlier this month a group of more than 80 Adidas workers called for an investigation into Ms Parkin's handling of racism, diversity and inclusion.
Ms Parkin said at a meeting for employees at the headquarters of Adidas brand Reebok last year that the issue of racism was ânoiseâ that was talked about only in the US.
Her resignation is one of the most high profile corporate moves yet as the death of Mr Floyd in May has intensified the focus on the discussion over racism and inequality around the world.
Ms Parkin, who is leaving the role with immediate effect, was the only woman on the company's board.
Her resignation means that the company's executive board is now made up entirely of white men. Adidas has previously said that it would take action to address issues of diversity and inclusion.
The company has promised to ensure that at least 30% of its new employees in America will come from black or Latino backgrounds.
It also set a target of those groups filling 12% of its US leadership roles within five years.
Adidas is also amongst the growing number of global brands to join the advertiser boycott of social media over their handling of racist content.
The move comes after the Stop Hate For Profit campaign called for companies to pause their Facebook and Instagram advertising for the month of July.
Some firms have gone further and suspended their ads on other platforms.
Adidas did not immediately reply for a request for comment from the BBC."
"Seals, dolphins and otters share the same physiological constraints as humans do when we return to our evolutionary home – the sea. The most instantly identifiable of these is the inability to breathe when we put our heads under water.  The difference between where an animal spends most of its time and where it can breathe has had an amazing impact on the physiological capacities of diving mammals – some of the most exceptional athletes on Earth.  For instance, the colossal elephant seal is capable of holding its breath for two hours and swimming 2km to find food, before covering that distance again for its next breath.  One important physiological tool that enables this lifestyle is greater total body oxygen stores. But oxygen stores alone don’t make a great diver.  What does make a great diver are the cardiovascular responses to diving – regulating the use of oxygen to give prolonged supply to vulnerable parts of the body, such as the brain. The most classic feature of the dive response is a reduction in heart rate, known as bradycardia.  It happens in humans too. If you put your face into a full sink, stimulation of sensors in your face, upper airways and throat trigger the deepest and most primal parts of your brain to slow your heart, as well as to pump less blood.  But reduction in heart rate by itself does not reduce the rate of oxygen consumption. It is this, linked to a major redistribution of blood around the body, focusing delivery on the most vital organs, which really conserves oxygen.  This blood redistribution is the essential tool that allows prolonged diving – and so far it has been a difficult thing to study. Because of the nature of diving animals (they dive and swim), technology has to be wearable and non-invasive for an animal that is free to choose where it goes. For it is in this voluntary free-diving state that we can learn the true dynamics of the cardiovascular system and understand how diving animals manage it.  Basically, what we want to do is to let the animals tell us their physiological “story” with minimal interference. And now they can. A new piece of equipment offering a fresh insight into blood redistribution is a remarkable non-invasive, wearable application of optical technology called “near-infrared spectroscopy” or NIRS.  NIRS uses light emitted in contact with the skin (like a FitBit) to measure blood volume and oxygenation in the underlying tissue. The new kit has provided a remarkable new insight in to the dynamics of blood redistribution in diving seals.  Using NIRS on juvenile harbour seals, one of the two species of UK seals, we were able to capture for the first time a level of cardiovascular control that we did not know seals possessed (and frankly, didn’t know existed at all).  Specifically, we found that in seals the blood redistribution component of the “dive response” is under some degree of cognitive control.  The seals we observed start to move blood away from their peripheral tissues (in this case blubber and skin) around 15 seconds before they began each dive. This allows seals to prepare for a dive and actually enter into the oxygen conservation state before they go under water, so that when they dive they are not wasting oxygen in the early stages.  As seals spend 90% of their time at sea diving, these seemingly small savings total up to very significant savings over days, weeks and even months of diving at sea.  In that sense, the finding of cognitive control of moving blood around the body makes a lot of sense, particularly considering that cognitive control of heart rate has been demonstrated in seals. Seals have already been shown to be able to drop their heart rate on command and also match the reduction in heart rate for the anticipated duration of the following dive.  Astoundingly, when a seal intends to make a longer dive, the reduction in heart rate is greater and matches the intended dive duration quite well. Anticipatory redistribution of blood and control of heart rate demonstrate a simply incredible level of physiological control, which is used to prepare and manage their body to suit their anticipated behaviour.  This is quite an amazing concept. Seals can reduce their rate of oxygen consumption by as much as 70% – a huge amount even compared to a hibernating bear, which can reduce the rate by 25%, or a sleeping human, about 10%.  As I mentioned, the difference between where some animals spend most of their time, and where they can breathe has had a wondrous impact on the physiological capacities of diving animals.  Non-invasive technology in the bio-medical world has allowed us to begin to understand just how wondrous their physiology really is. Away from the constraints of laboratory settings or simulated dives, seals can wear a small instrument, dive and behave as they like, and then tell us their physiological story.  So next time you jump into a swimming pool, consider the physiological changes your body is making to protect your brain against asphyxia, all automatically and without thought. Then imagine being able to control and regulate those changes – that’s what those amazing seals can do when you see them bobbing around the sea."

"Earlier this week the certificate of sustainable status for North Sea cod was suspended by the Marine Stewardship Council. And yet just two years ago cod stocks were heralded as having recovered and the coveted certificate of sustainability was awarded. How could the fortunes of this fish have changed so quickly? The simple answer is that North Sea cod had never recovered, leaving serious questions about both the science and management of the stock. The most recent analysis of the stock by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) – the body that provides official scientific advice to governments – shows that cod declined almost continuously from the 1960s until the early 2000s. During this period fishing removed about 40-60% of the stock each year, a removal rate that was clearly unsustainable. But this percentage dropped dramatically around 2007 and the stock began to recover. This change occurred because controls on catches improved and the number of trawlers declined. To strengthen management of the stock, the European Commission introduced a Cod Recovery Plan that included further reductions in catches, additional controls on the number of days that cod trawlers could spend at sea, and where they could fish. Scientists and fishery managers judge the sustainability of a stock by its size, measured as the total weight or “biomass”, and the percentage of the stock removed by fishing each year. A limit is set on the minimum biomass of adult fish in the sea – called the “spawning stock biomass” (SSB) – that ensures enough young fish can be produced to replace those that are caught.  Managers try to keep the SSB above 150,000 tonnes, and restrict the removal rate to below 25%. The most recent assessment by ICES estimates the SSB to be barely half the minimum level, with a removal rate nearly double the maximum limit – a situation that is almost certainly not sustainable. When the cod stock was awarded its MSC certificate of sustainability, ICES estimated the SSB in 2016 to be 161,000 tonnes with a removal rate of about 29%, so it was believed to be well above the minimum stock size with a removal rate only slightly above the maximum. At this point, in 2017, acting on ICES’ advice, the European Commission dropped the cod recovery plan, abandoning days-at-sea controls and raising limits on allowed catches which undoubtedly has contributed to the present problems. But if we look at the latest ICES assessment of the stock, it also shows that the SSB in 2016 never rose above the minimum as was thought, but was actually 22% below it. The changed perception has arisen in retrospect because new, detailed data collected across ten cod age groups since 2016 shows there must have been fewer fish than was previously thought.  On top of this, the removal rate was well above the maximum. So now ICES has revised its earlier estimates, showing that the cod recovery plan should never have been abandoned and that the evidence on which the MSC certificate was granted was itself unreliable. The stock had never fully recovered. When fish stocks decline it is commonplace to blame the fishing industry for greedily over-exploiting stocks or for managers to be criticised for not heeding scientific advice. The changing environment, particularly the warming of the oceans, is also cited as a cause of decline. Over-exploitation has undoubtedly occurred and managers must take responsibility for weak action in the light of clear evidence of chronic over-exploitation. We also know that cod is a cold water species likely to suffer as a result of ocean warming resulting in fewer young fish being spawned. But we should not lose sight of the weaknesses in the scientific evidence that led the European Commission to end the cod recovery plan. With hindsight, the earlier analysis was over-optimistic and resulted in a poor management decision which in turn has aggravated the problems for the stock. When calculating safe limits for cod and the rate at which they are fished, ICES takes into account uncertainty in the stock size estimates. What is clear from the North Sea cod experience is that the scientific analysis is far more uncertain than is believed. This means that scientists need to better understand the robustness of their assessments and that managers should be far more aware of the limitations of the technical advice they receive and act in a more precautionary manner. The outlook for North Sea cod is poor. The typical number of young fish being produced each year is at an all-time low and will not sustain large-scale fishing in the long term. While the environment is a likely factor in its decline there is a need for all involved – fishers, managers and scientists – to raise their game and ensure a sustainable future."

Today the US State Department reported ‘no major environmental objections to the proposed $7 billion Keystone pipeline’. I wonder what Obamas and Kerrys reasons for further delay will be now?

WASHINGTON (AP) — The long-delayed Keystone XL oil pipeline cleared a major hurdle toward approval Friday, a serious blow to environmentalists’ hopes that President Barack Obama will block the controversial project running more than 1,000 miles from Canada through the heart of the U.S.
The State Department reported no major environmental objections to the proposed $7 billion pipeline, which has become a symbol of the political debate over climate change.

"Most of the heat from global warming has gone into the oceans, so it is no wonder that the seas are experiencing massive heatwaves too. What’s more, climate change is causing a fall in global ocean oxygen levels. Hotter oceans, with less oxygen, sounds like bad news for marine life. But new research colleagues and I have published in Science Advances has shown how marine plants and organisms that live along the coasts – algae, seagrasses, mangrove and corals – can add oxygen to the water. We found this extra oxygen protects animals from heat stress and will make them more resilient to climate change. Scientists have often studied the effect of temperature on the physiological response of marine animals. But, until now, the role of the oxygen produced by organism such as plants, algae and corals has been overlooked. To see if this effect would be apparent across a variety of animals you’d find in the sea, we rounded up a total of 249 animals from six species belonging to four distantly related groups. Two of the species, we found in mangroves near our fieldwork site on the Saudi coast of the Red Sea: the spiny rock crab and the small silverside fish. From a nearby coral reef we found the black sea cucumber and the colourful fish Dascyllus. And finally we gathered up samples of the horsemussel and Ophiocoma, a “brittle star” closely related to starfish. We then took these sample animals back to the lab, where we could measure their tolerance to increased water temperature at normal and high levels of oxygen. In this way, we could mimic the real condition these animals experience in the environment. The animals we tested are all unable to “thermoregulate” like mammals, and so their metabolisms accelerate with the temperature. The warmer it is, the more oxygen is required.  We found that high levels of oxygen allowed them to cope with higher temperature. This is because oxygen is the combustive agent that helps them produce more energy from their food. (Something similar is also used in human medicine: hyperbaric oxygen therapy can form part of the treatment for cancers and other conditions.) It makes sense, therefore, for these animals to live close to organisms like seagrass or coral which can guarantee a good supply of oxygen during the warmest hours of the day, when photosynthesis is also at its peak. Our research also looked at which plants were responsible for adding oxygen to the water, and when. Every five minutes for a whole year we monitored the temperature and oxygen levels of the seawater among mangrove trees, seagrasses and a coral reef – again, all near our research site in the Red Sea. We showed that the level of oxygen in the water fluctuated significantly. In fact, during the warmest hours of the day it was more than double the normal saturation.  Mangroves, coral reefs and seagrass meadows are all vital for marine biodiversity, for fisheries and as habitable links to help individual animals jump from one population to another. But often they are threatened by human activities, such as dredge fishing and the expansion and development of coastal cities. If more oxygen can make marine species more resilient to temperature stress then oxygen – and the organisms that generate it – must be taken into account in environmental policies along the coasts. In Scotland, for example, kelp is an important source of oxygen which may help associated animals face a rapidly changing environment. It therefore deserves scientific attention and governmental protection."

There’s been no warming, and the poles even have more sea ice today – about 1 million sq. km more!
At his site Limbaugh quoted Larry David, husband of AIT producer Laurie David:
You know, Al is a funny guy, but he’s also a very serious guy who believes humans may have only 10 years left to save the planet from turning into a total frying pan.”
CO2 climate science, like all sciences, is also proving to be flat out wrong. The difference here is that there is so much at stake that no one wants to admit it.

Australian PM Scott Morrison has shown a commendable willingness to stand up to the bullies of globalism on the world stage. He has [repudiated the hypocritical sniping of the Pacific Islands Forum](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/08/scott-morrison-stands-firm-against-jacindas-virtue-bullying/), told the UN to its face [to take a hike on climate alarmism](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/09/morrison-aims-to-actually-fix-the-environment-instead-of-screeching-about-climate-change/), and [sided with US president Trump against the globalist agenda](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/scott-morrison-socks-it-to-the-globalist-elite/).



If only he showed more of the same brass at home.



It’s insane. We have hysterics sobbing on TV, gluing themselves to our roads and spitting on people going to a mining conference. We have wild-eyed people so bizarrely convinced that global warming will kill us all that children are skipping school and adults are fighting police in our streets. And what’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s response to this mass madness?



No, it’s not to explain why there’s actually no climate catastrophe. Not once has Morrison dared say that.



Instead, he now proposes…new laws to stop protesters who “disrupt people’s jobs and their livelihoods”.



While there is some small commendation in being willing to stand up to the zealous nutcases of Extinction Rebellion, Morrison’s response also betrays what is in fact the greatest fault with his government: its almost paranoid obsession with “security”. Because the plain fact is that we already **have** laws which should be able to deal with these loons: laws against trespass, blocking public thoroughfares, assaulting police and their horse, and spitting on and assaulting people going about their lawful business.



What we don’t have is the political and judicial will to properly enforce those laws.



Just ask Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. He had far-Left protesters on the roof of his office, scaring his staff and unfurling a banner calling him an “international criminal”.



But what did the magistrate say to the protesters? That he’d be proud if his daughter had been part of that protest.



Or take the magistrate who refused last month to jail Extinction Rebellion organiser Eric Herbert for locking himself to a car in the street, even though it was his eighth time in court on protest-related offences in just four months, most involving blocking Brisbane’s roads at peak hour.



We have the laws. But we also have a judiciary which has been white-anted by a succession of left-wing governments handing out judicial jobs to their mates, and a succession of conservative governments too gutless to do anything about it.



Instead of insisting that perfectly adequate existing laws actually be enforced, the Morrison government is taking the lamentable step of restricting our liberties with ever-more laws. Its “religious freedom” legislation is another example. The religious freedom problem is easily fixed: repeal the odious web of “human rights” laws that restrict our freedom of speech.



Let us generously allow that the Morrison government has its heart in the right place. Morrison’s willingness to stand up to globalists and [their cronies in the Australian Public Service](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/morrison-thinks-for-himself-bureaucrats-outraged/) suggest as much. But its head is in entirely the wrong place when it comes to its domestic legislative agenda.



 **Instead of restricting more and more what the state says we are allowed to say and do, the Morrison government needs to reassert the basic principle of liberty: what the state is _not allowed to stop us saying and doing_.**

Even if Donald J. Trump is not elected President of the United States next week, his emergence as a major political force poses a serious challenge to transatlantic relations.



Trump is a polarizing figure. He is prone to making offensive and insensitive remarks, and frequently seems uninformed. Many Americans doubt that he has the temperament to be president. Meanwhile, conservative activists within the Republican Party doubt his commitment to conservative principles across the board, including on major hot‐​button issues like abortion rights and health care. Business interests are turned off by his attacks on international trade agreements. For these and other reasons, the likelihood of him actually becoming president is low.



But such odds are nonetheless worrisome for many foreign elites. Trump has openly questioned the value of long‐​standing U.S. alliances, including the most venerable of these, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Even a small chance that the United States will not come to the defense of its NATO allies in their hour of need cannot be comforting for those who have been told for decades that it would.



A very different political figure, one more reliably conservative or liberal, better prepared for governing, and less prone to outrageous statements about women, or minority religious and ethnic groups, could adopt many of Trump’s policy stances, and have a better chance of winning.





It was unwise to base U.S. foreign policy — and, by extension, the security of most of the planet — on the assumption that Americans would forever bear the burdens of global governance.



The mere _possibility_ that America’s obligation within the NATO alliance might be open to interpretation should therefore serve as a powerful incentive for European countries to hedge their bets and get serious about developing a credible defense capability, one that is capable of acting without the United States in the lead.



Regardless of whether that occurs, it was probably unwise for Europeans to have relied so much on a U.S. political system over which they had no control. The fact that a bipartisan consensus among U.S. foreign policy elites sustained the transatlantic bargain for decades didn’t mean that that consensus was permanent.



Conversely, they can be forgiven for believing that it might have lasted a while longer. After all, it has survived challenges in the past. And it still might. Hillary Clinton, whose talk of America’s exceptional role in global security echoes the conventional wisdom among policy elites, has a strong chance of winning the presidency.



 **The Primacist Consensus in American Politics**



What is the foreign policy consensus among American elites? To the extent that it can be summarized in a single word, that word is “primacy”: a foreign policy that hinges on a forward‐​deployed military geared to stopping prospective threats before they materialize. Primacy holds that it would be too dangerous to allow other countries to defend themselves and their interests. Some will botch the job, necessitating costly U.S. intervention later. Others will succeed too well, unleashing arms races that would alter the delicate balance of regional or international relations. Thus, primacy reassures, and it discourages other countries from defending themselves and their interests.



For much of the past two decades, these underlying premises of U.S. foreign policy have not changed, although the preferred terms or phrases to describe them have. Other popular variations include “deep engagement,” “unipolarity,” “liberal hegemony,” or the particularly grandiose “benevolent global hegemony.”



President Obama favors “leadership.” That word appears 35 times in his latest National Security Strategy [1]. His predecessors have all had similar aspirations, although most managed to work in a few more synonyms. But it all boils down to primacy.



For example, at the dawn of the post‐​Cold War era, officials in the George H.W. Bush administration aspired for the United States to be the sole global power. Now that the nation’s long‐​time rival was gone, the object of U.S. foreign policy, according to an early draft of the Defense Planning Guidance, was to “prevent the re‐​emergence of a new rival” capable of challenging U.S. power in any vital area, including Western Europe, Asia, or the territory of the former Soviet Union. To accomplish this task, the United States would retain preponderant military power, not merely to deter attacks against the United States, but also to deter “potential competitors” — including long‐​time U.S. allies such as Germany and Japan — “from even aspiring to a larger regional or global role.”



The defenders of this arrangement, whereby the U.S. government provides security for the world while the governments of all other countries focus mostly on domestic needs, contend that the inherent liberalism of the United States explains the durability of its hegemony. Unlike illiberal empires of the past, the United States, as a liberal country domestically, serves as a liberal hegemon globally. That explains why it hasn’t given rise to the types of balancing coalitions seen in the past. The vast majority of countries benefit from U.S. hegemony, the argument goes, and few have anything to fear from it when it does exercise its power.



But a truly liberal system includes the essential element of self‐​determination; individuals must have a say in who governs them and how they are governed. Yet, the vast majority of people that fall under the dominion of the United States will have no role in selecting its next leader. They can’t vote in U.S. elections. And the awkward realization that they have entrusted their security to another government, liberal though it may be, over which they have no control, is crashing down hard on them.



 **Anxious Allies**



How else to explain why foreign leaders have been so outspoken in their denunciations of Donald Trump? Public officials traditionally avoid weighing in on such matters. Few wish to be seen as meddling in another country’s political affairs. Within the past year, however, quite a number of senior officials have loudly criticized Trump. Indeed, if the presidential contest in the United States was to be decided by expressions of ill‐​will by non‐​Americans, Trump would be on his way to a landslide victory.



A few examples:



Other words uttered by foreign leaders to describe Trump’s remarks include: “ignorant,” “dumb,” “barking mad,” “irrational,” and “scary.” Trump, the person, has been variously described as “an idiot,” “a buffoon,” an “ignorant racist,” and “a wazzock.”



Trump probably cherishes such scorn. His campaign, built around a naked appeal to “America First” and an open disregard for the opinions of others, especially those of elites and non‐​Americans, has clearly benefitted from a sense among many of his supporters that typical American politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, pay too much attention to what others around the world think.



The international disquiet that Trump has caused, however, suggests a major flaw at the heart of U.S. foreign policy and the international order that it has created. It has reminded us all that U.S. elections could have a direct impact on not merely the 320+ million people in the United States, but arguably the 7+ billion people of the world.



In many respects, the U.S. government has taken on a task typically entrusted to other governments — namely, providing security for their people. It is not hyperbole, therefore, when President Hollande says “an American election is a world election.” Former Spanish foreign minister, Ana Palacio, echoed these sentiments: “The opportunism, unreliability and amorality that we have seen during the [Trump] campaign would be damaging for the world in general and hurt Europe in particular.” In other words, there is a reasonably widespread assumption that the government that Americans choose to govern America also governs, loosely, the rest of the world.



But that was never the intention. And so, to the extent that the United States attempts to govern the world, it does a poor job.



The U.S. government exists first and foremost to provide security for the people of the United States. Americans elect the person that they believe will keep _their_ country safe and prosperous. If doing so also benefits the rest of the world — and it often does — that is a pleasant by‐​product. Very few Americans, however, would confuse providing security for others as the core object of U.S. foreign policy.



Too many American elites, however, have taken the U.S. Constitution’s pledge to “provide for the common defense” as a mandate that extends even to those men and women who are not party to that iconic document’s unique social contract. And U.S. policymakers’ repeated assurances to the leaders of other countries that Washington _will_ treat their security concerns as synonymous with America’s own have led many to neglect their defenses. Indeed, as noted above, that was the object of U.S. foreign policy.



Thus, U.S. foreign policy is characterized by a dramatic disconnect between what Americans expect of it and what the nation’s leaders are giving them. And Donald Trump has ruthlessly exploited that gap.



In the past, the vast majority of U.S. policymakers, of all political persuasions, were inclined to ignore the elite versus public divide. If Trump loses in November, they are even more likely to do so. Americans have never been strongly supportive of primacy, but the issue has rarely had political salience. Elections are not won or lost on a candidate’s commitment to preserving primacy, although Americans are sensitive to the perception of relative decline, strategic weakness, or increased vulnerability to threats. This may explain the appeal of Trump’s signature slogan to “Make America Great Again.”



But while U.S. domestic politics may temporarily still favor the grand strategic status quo, the longer term economic and strategic context does not. The costs of primacy are rising; and the benefits are intangible, at best.



Even one of the strongest advocates of primacy conceded more than a decade ago that it might not be realistic to expect Americans to bear the burdens of global governance indefinitely.



“Americans,” Michael Mandelbaum grudgingly admitted in his book, _The Case for Goliath_ , “approach the world much as other people do…. For the American public, foreign policy, like charity, begins at home.” For that reason, above all others, Mandelbaum predicted, “the American role in the world may depend in part on Americans not scrutinizing it too closely.”



In retrospect, it was unwise to base U.S. foreign policy — and, by extension, the security of most of the planet — on the assumption that Americans would forever bear the costs without questioning the need to do so. Further, it was unwise to believe that historically strong nations such as China and Russia would let such an arrangement go unchallenged. Looking ahead, it would be particularly foolish to base a global security strategy on these now‐​disproved suppositions.



 **Trump’s Incoherent Opportunism, and the Opportunity for Positive Change**



For now, the Washington foreign policy consensus survives. Barely. Trump’s frontal assault on that consensus has prompted a predictable backlash from the elites who crafted it. The real estate mogul is all too happy to fire right back, but, as with so much of his campaign, there is little substance to his attacks.



Indeed, Trump ultimately endorsed the view that U.S. foreign policy, and thus the roles and missions assigned to the U.S. military, will remain unchanged. Although he had previously questioned the Pentagon’s spending practices, and hinted at making U.S. allies pay more for the security services they receive from the U.S. military, Trump now calls for dramatic increases for the Pentagon’s budget. A speech on September 7, 2016, drew praise even from some avowed #NeverTrumpers who were encouraged that the unconventional GOP nominee had adopted conventional approaches to growing the U.S. military.



In one sense, this call for more military spending is the logical response. It is unreasonable to expect the U.S. military to do the same, or more, with less. It is unfair to the troops and their families. Both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have railed against the spending caps imposed by the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. Most in Washington, DC, believe that the only way to address the means/​end mismatch is to remove the fiscal constraints.



But the U.S. military’s roles and missions are a function of the nation’s grand strategy, and that strategy must take account of the resources that can be made available to execute it. In the current domestic political context, increasing the means entails telling the American people to accept cuts in popular domestic programs, higher taxes, more government debt, or all three of these things, so that U.S. allies and security partners don’t feel the need to boost their defenses.



It seems unlikely that Americans will embrace such an approach forever. “Defending our allies’ security” ranked near the bottom of Americans’ foreign policy priorities — tied with “Limiting Climate Change” — in the Chicago Council on Global Affairs’ most recent report on American public opinion. Future U.S. leaders may eventually align the object of U.S. foreign policy with the American people’s wishes.



In the meantime, Trump’s emergence provides an opportunity for leaders of all countries to reconsider how much trust they wish to place in the United States as the guarantor of global security. Some, perhaps many, will hedge their bets, and revisit their decision to sub‐​contract governance to an unpredictable partner — one that, their wishes notwithstanding, they do not control.



The flaws inherent in primacy were apparent for some time. Without intending to do so, or even realizing that he’d done so, the mercurial Mr. Trump may be responsible for a welcome change in global security policy. If the reaction against him creates a more resilient international order, one that is less dependent on the military power of a single country, that would be a silver lining to Trump’s otherwise dark cloud.

Some folks over at Heritage have a new Issues Brief in which they argue for including an Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) mechanism in the U.S.-EU trade deal being negotiated right now. In a nutshell, ISDS lets foreign investors sue host country governments in an international tribunal when they feel certain of their rights have been infringed.   
  
I’ve been critical of ISDS. I do see the potential that such international rules have for protecting property rights, but I worry about other aspects of the rules. One issue is that these rules protect the rights only of foreign investors. Using Venezuela as an example, there’s an assumption that the courts there can’t help much with protecting rights. To some extent, ISDS is a response to that. So, if Exxon feels its operations there have been badly treated by the Venezuelan government, it can use the ISDS mechanism to have recourse to an international tribunal. However, if a small Venezuelan dry cleaner is being subject to governmental abuse, it’s just out of luck. To me, that seems problematic. Focusing on the wealthy seems like a fundamentally unbalanced way to protect property rights.   




But beyond that, these investment obligations are not limited to protecting property rights. There are much broader provisions that allow foreign investors to sue for, well, lots of things, and perhaps just about anything. Here’s an example from a Canada-Barbados investment treaty:   




… Mr. Peter Allard, Canadian owner of the Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary, contends that the Government of Barbados has violated its international obligations by refusing to enforce its environmental laws.   
  
…   
  
Mr. Allard acquired the land for the Sanctuary in the mid-1990s and subsequently developed it into an eco-tourism facility. In the notice of dispute, Mr. Allard claims to have taken numerous steps to contribute to the sustainability of the Sanctuary only to have such efforts thwarted by the acts and omissions of Barbados.   
  
Mr. Allard asserts that Barbados’ acts and omissions have severely damaged that natural ecosystem relied upon to attract tourists to the Sanctuary. Consequently, Mr. Allard contends that Barbados failed to provide his investment full protection and security and fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the Canada-Barbados BIT.   
  
With respect to Barbados’ omissions to protect the Sanctuary, Mr. Allard argues that Barbados has, among other things, failed to: (i) prevent the repeated discharge of raw sewage into the Sanctuary wetlands, (ii) investigate or prosecute sources of runoff of grease, oil, pesticides, and herbicides from neighboring areas, and (iii) investigate or prosecute poachers that have threatened the wildlife within the Sanctuary.



To sum all that up: A Canadian who invested in Barbados is suing the Barbados government under an investment treaty for failure to protect its environment in accordance with its domestic law.   
  
Will this claim succeed? It's not clear. But what is clear is that the scope of these obligations is extremely broad and vague, enough so that it’s worth law firms’ time and money to explore the boundaries. This is why I wrote that these agreements are more about litigation than liberalization.   
  
Now, it may be that, in this particular case, the government of Barbados was behaving badly (“discharge of raw sewage” is rarely a good thing). I’m not familiar with the facts of the case, so I can’t say for sure who’s right and who’s wrong here. But the larger issue is, what exactly is the scope for when foreign investors can sue governments for failing to protect the environment? Among his claims, the investor says he has not been provided with “fair and equitable treatment.” That’s a potentially broad obligation, which can be used in a lot of ways. It’s not too hard to imagine, say, a claim that a government’s failure to take action against climate change was a violation. If you believe climate change needs to be addressed, you might cite to various international reports on climate change, and argue that the impact of climate change on your business is “unfair,” and the government needs to do something. (To further illustrate the broadness of these obligations, if, in the alternative, you were skeptical of climate change, you might point to other climate data, and argue that actions that governments have taken against climate change (e.g., cap and trade) have harmed your business in a way that is “unfair.”)   
  
The environment isn’t my area of expertise, so I’ll leave it to others to decide what our environmental problems are and what we should do about them. But it seems to me that an international law obligation that allows foreign investors to sue governments on the basis that they have not protected the environment, or have protected it too much, is kind of a big deal, and something that we should understand the scope of a little better than we do now. (And keep in mind, there is nothing special about the environment here – all domestic policy areas are in play). These issues are being litigated in international courts, and we should have a better sense of what that means before we extend ISDS further through new trade agreements.

In contemporary American government, the presidency is dominating Congress in our system of separate‐​but‐​competing branches. This constitutional imbalance is a growing threat to liberty, and the only solution is to make Congress great again.



Let’s start with first principles: The Constitution sets forth our governmental structure in its first three Articles.



Article I of the Constitution establishes Congress. Article II creates the presidency. And Article III renders the Supreme Court.



Did you notice that Congress is number one?



That’s not by accident. The Founding Fathers took it for granted that Congress is first among equals within our tripartite government.



Indeed, the Founders feared Congress most of all. In Federalist 47, James Madison worried that Congress’s “impetuous vortex” would swallow up the authority wielded by its coordinate branches.



Ultimately, the Founders feared most the concentration of power, which Madison described as being the “very definition of tyranny.”



For most of its history, Congress has lived up to these expectations. Now, however, our once‐​grand legislature is a shell of its former self.



With respect to current events, the best evidence of Congress’s fall is the ongoing impeachment debacle.



The Founding Fathers intended impeachment to be Congress’s ultimate weapon in a permanent competition with the presidency. In Federalist 66, Alexander Hamilton wrote that impeachment is Congress’s “essential check” on “encroachments” by the executive branch.



In accordance with these expectations, past impeachments have been part and parcel of structural battles between Congress and the presidency.



Consider President Richard Nixon. Sure, Congress put him through the impeachment wringer, but lawmakers also enacted reforms to shift the balance of power towards Congress. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, for example, beefed up congressional staff and resources. And the Budget Impoundment and Control Act of 1974 attempted to reassert Congress’s power over the purse.



Similarly, the 19th century impeachment of President Andrew Johnson was emmeshed within a larger struggle between the elected branches of government.



Today’s impeachment of President Donald Trump, by contrast, has nothing to do with checking executive power. Instead, it’s all about winning the presidency on behalf of the two political parties.



Getting two‐​thirds of the Senate to go along with removing President Trump was never going to happen, so instead House Democrats are using the impeachment inquiry to sway next November’s vote.



For their part, Senate Republicans are embracing a trial, reportedly in the hope that a drawn‐​out process will keep Democratic presidential candidates in the Senate off the campaign trail during the crucial first primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire.



Meanwhile, neither the House nor Senate currently is trying to enact substantive reforms that would rein in executive overreach. Rather than competing with the president, both chambers in Congress are leveraging the proceedings to conduct partisan political campaigns for the presidency.



What’s going on here? Why have the House and Senate, through the impeachment process, become willing cogs in the oily machinery of the 2020 presidential contest?



The answer involves a tectonic shift in American government, from a functioning separation of powers to one that is alarmingly out of whack. To appreciate today’s perverted impeachment process, one must understand how the president supplanted Congress as policymaker‐​in‐​chief.



Our imbalanced constitutional process results from three interrelated historical developments.



The first is that Congress, over the last century, has given away, or “delegated,” much of its policymaking initiative to the executive branch. For the most part, Congress delegates to pass the buck. When voters want something done, lawmakers could legislate policy specifics, but they’ll get blamed if they err. By delegating, Congress can escape accountability by having agencies make tough choices.



Thus, Congress has delegated into existence an alphabet soup’s worth of regulatory agencies, which are collectively known as the administrative state.



The second historical development is the centralization of power in Congress under the control of party leaders. When Congress first started giving away its power, lawmakers took pains to oversee their delegations through a system of strong committees in the House and Senate. From the New Deal to the Reagan era, powerful committee chairs vied with presidential appointees for influence at regulatory agencies.



During the last 40 years, however, Congress changed. Demographic shifts led to the end of blocs of southern Democrats and northeastern Republicans. Without these moderate voices, the two parties became more uniform in outlook.



As hive‐​mentalities were taking hold in Congress, opportunistic leaders, such as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME), consolidated power with rules changes, procedural maneuvering, and the distribution of party resources. As power shifted from committees to party leadership, Congress lost the capacity to oversee its delegations.



This brings us to the third historical development. As Congress lost interest in managing agency policymaking, modern presidents have seized undisputed supremacy over the administrative state. Since Nixon, an unbroken succession of presidents tightened the Oval Office’s grip over agency spending and regulatory output, primarily through the administrative state’s brain—the Office of Management and Budget within the Executive Office of the President.



The upshot is that policy now flows from the White House rather than Capitol Hill. In 2018, federal agencies issued 12 rules and regulations for every law Congress passed (3,367 agency rules, compared to Congress’s 291 laws).



Nor are these middling measures. Major economic and social policies—identical to those that Congress considered but ultimately rejected—now regularly emanate from the executive branch.



For example, Congress couldn’t pass immigration reform, net neutrality, nor a carbon dioxide cap‐​and‐​trade, but President Barack Obama achieved the same results unilaterally using the power that Congress already had given away.



Republican presidents, alas, are no less guilty of executive excess. To wit, lawmakers denied President Trump funding to build a border wall, but then he exercised his delegated authority to expand the wall without Congress.



In a celebrated law review article written when she was a professor at Harvard University, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan wrote that contemporary government is defined by “presidential administration” due to the president’s “comparative primacy [relative to Congress] in setting the direction and influencing the outcome of administrative process.” Today, the president doesn’t merely set the agenda; he controls its creation and execution.



In this context—where the president calls the shots and Congress is beholden to party leadership—half the legislature always is unbothered with unbound executive authority whenever “their guy” occupies the White House.



It’s a vicious feedback loop. The more powerful the president becomes, the more our party‐​centric Congress rationally believes that the Oval Office is the most efficient means to implement the planks of a given party’s platform.



Of course, the parties whine about executive overreach, but only when they don’t occupy the White House. Neither party seeks to claw back power from the presidency, because each side wants its respective team to exercise executive authority.



So, congressional Republicans cried foul about executive power when President Obama resorted to his “phone and pen,” but then rallied to the support of President Trump when he disregarded Congress’s “power of the purse” in funding the border wall. And Democratic lawmakers now complain about presidential power, even though they gave President Obama an ovation when he threatened to bypass Congress on climate change during the 2013 State of the Union address.



Today’s supine Congress would be unrecognizable to the Founding Fathers. They understood that a concentration of power threatens individual liberty, so they designed a government with three branches—executive, legislative, and judicial—and gave each the means to check the other. By dispersing power into competing institutions, the Founders’ constitutional design serves to protect our individual liberty. At present, this constitutional design is buckling.



As noted above, the Founding Fathers feared congressional power most of all. Federalist 62 warns that an “excess of lawmaking” is a “disease” to which “our government is most liable.” For this reason, the Constitution makes it hard to pass laws. Statutes must be passed by both chambers of Congress, and then signed by the president. It’s an arduous journey for a bill to become a law.



By contrast, it’s far easier for the president to impose a regulation. All he needs to do is pick up the phone to get the ball rolling.



Because all regulations carry the force of law, a government characterized by “presidential administration” incubates the “disease” of “excessive lawmaking” no less than a government controlled by Congress. Overweening government is a threat to liberty, regardless whether it’s flowing from the executive or legislative branch of government.



The solution, of course, is to bring balance back to our separation of powers. Congress must rediscover its institutional ambition, and once again engage in robust competition with the presidency.



So, how do we make Congress great again?



Congress might be compelled to get its act together, even if it doesn’t want to.



For almost 80 years, the Supreme Court has refused to police how much power Congress transfers to the executive branch. Under its “nondelegation doctrine,” the Court allows any delegation, as long as it is bounded by an “intelligible principle.”



In practice, however, the Court construed “intelligible principle” so broadly that the concept has no meaning. Even a phrase as nebulous as “public interest” has met the standard.



For the first time since the New Deal‐​era, a majority on the Supreme Court has expressed a willingness to revisit the nondelegation doctrine. Were the Court to add teeth to its “intelligible principle” test, then Congress would be forced to curtail the breadth of its delegations to the executive branch.



Turning from the Supreme Court to Congress, there are many institutional reforms that the legislature could take to empower itself vis‐​a‐​vis the presidency.



Starting with the easiest measures, Congress could remedy its anemic staffing. In fact, the current level of committee staffing is commensurate with levels from the early 1970s, even though government has grown much larger and more complex in the five decades since.



And it’s not just congressional committees that are understaffed. Congress also has starved support agencies, such as the Congressional Research Service, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Government Accountability Office. These organizations employed 6,354 professionals in 1991; in 2015, the number stood at 3,833.



Congress also could create new institutions to better compete. In the early 1980s, the president unilaterally established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (within the Office of Management and Budget) to manage regulations out of the White House. Yet Congress has no commensurate capacity. There is an obvious need for Congress to create its own comparable mechanism to oversee agency rules.



Congress could adopt simple legislative fixes. For example, lawmakers used to regularly limit the clock on their delegations, such that an agency’s regulatory authority expired after a given time. These “sunset” provisions force Congress to periodically review the programs it creates, before these regimes are re‐​authorized.



Or lawmakers could make greater use of “resolutions of disapproval,” which allow them to veto individual regulations. Since Congress created these “legislative vetoes” more than two decades ago, lawmakers have employed this device fewer than 20 times—far less than two percent of the total number of major rules promulgated by agencies during that span.



If it wanted to get bold, Congress could pass more comprehensive reform. The Regulatory Accountability Act, for example, would require agencies to better justify rules that cost more than $100 million.



And if Congress wanted to regain the upper hand in one fell swoop, the House and Senate would get behind the REINS Act, which would require both chambers of Congress to approve all major regulations before they took effect.



These reforms are fantastic ideas, to be sure, but they’re all nonstarters for as long as love of party trumps institutional pride in Congress. You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. Even were Congress to pass REINS, no doubt the House and Senate could find a way to avoid accountability.



Most likely, we need a new type of lawmaker, one who is cut from old cloth. Lawmakers of the not too distant past understood that the presidency—and not merely its office-holder—is the Congress’s constitutional rival. To restore crucial safeguards for “We the People,” we must Make Congress Great Again.

Poor old Martin Martyn Bradbury. No wonder his blog is so depressing. A recent post is all doom and climate gloom.



By 2030, over 50% of the oceans will be collapsing as bio-habitats.



This quote links to _The Washington Post_ , that paragon of scientific rigour:



More than half the world’s oceans **could** suffer multiple symptoms of climate change over the next 15 years, including rising temperatures, acidification, lower oxygen levels and decreasing food supplies, new research **suggests.** By midcentury, without significant efforts to reduce warming, more than 80 percent **could** be ailing — and the fragile Arctic, already among the most rapidly warming parts of the planet, **may be** one of the regions most severely hit.The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, **uses computer models …**



Could, might, may be – models suggest! Say no more. Get some real facts, Martyn, before you worry.



By 2030, East Coast cities in the U.S. can expect to see two to three-times as many flooding incidents.



More panic based on models and dodgy sea-level rise prediction. But still, if it is in the _Guardian_ , it must be true.



By 2030, 122million will be driven into extreme poverty as direct result of climate change.



More coulds and maybes reported in the _Guardian_ from the UN FAO. Well, they’re not biased, so it must be true.



By 2030, 100million will die as a direct consequence of climate change.



This links to a _Reuters_ article that says:



It calculated that five million deaths occur each year from air pollution, hunger and disease as a result of climate change and carbon-intensive economies, and that toll would likely rise to six million a year by 2030 if current patterns of fossil fuel use continue. 



In the context that 55.3 million people die every year anyway, how are these particular 5 million going to be linked to ‘fossil fuel use’?



By 2030, even if the Paris Agreement is actually implemented, we will see a planet warm to 3.4 degrees by the end of this century meaning there will effectively be no future civilisation capable of surviving on a planet that warm.



People do that evil flying thing to visit Australia and Fiji etc because it is 3.4°C warmer there than here. Their civilisations seem to be surviving OK.



By 2030, the global annual cost of global warming will be $3trillion.



But isn’t ‘global warming’ over? Aren’t we now onto ‘climate change’? Certainly the warming is not keeping pace with CO2 rises; that is why they changed the name. Any numbers based on ‘warming’ are going to be considerably wrong.



2030, the number of extremely hot days — classified as maximum temperatures of more than 35C — are tipped to climb **in all capital cities.**



This links to an **Australian** study. It talks about **Australian** capital cities. Wellingtonians need not panic.



But don’t fret folks, by 2050 NZ might be carbon neutral!



My GP assures me that in all likelihood I will be around in 2030 so I shall write another article following up on all these outlandish claims. My confident prediction, based on the [climate ‘experts’ prediction success rate](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fails-summary/) to date, is that [Martin Martyn ](https://thebfd.co.nz/the-bfd-dictionary/)will be 100% [wrongly wrongson](https://thebfd.co.nz/the-bfd-dictionary/) once again.

"You’re probably used to hearing that the ocean is full of plastic, but scientists are puzzled by a rather different problem – there actually appears to be a lot less of it than there should be. Most large plastic debris floats, but observations of it on the sea surface offshore are far lower than what would be expected, considering that 8m metric tonnes of plastic is estimated to empty into the ocean from land each year. Scientists assumed that the missing plastic has simply broken down into tiny microplastics and sunk to the sea floor. These particles are smaller than 5mm and either sink or float depending on the type of plastic and what happens while they’re in the ocean. But there’s still plastic that has been floating at the surface in the open ocean for decades, so clearly not enough has fragmented to account for the discrepancy. So where’s the rest of it going? To try and solve the mystery, scientists from The Ocean Cleanup – an environmental organisation dedicated to removing plastic waste from the ocean – modelled how plastics move in nearshore and open ocean currents to predict where they’re accumulating. Their findings suggest that even radical action to phase out plastics wouldn’t prevent a potential explosion in marine microplastics by mid-century. The researchers found that nearshore currents tend to trap a lot of plastic debris in coastal waters. The plastic that you find littering the strand line on beaches is brought in with the tide and then taken out again. It may swirl around offshore for a while and travel further along the coast, but this plastic tends to return to beaches and may stay stuck in this rhythm – from beach to coastal waters and back – for many years.  Occasionally, some of this plastic escapes the nearshore currents and is buoyed far out to sea by oceanic currents. The plastic waste that’s found far from shore – such as in open ocean areas like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch – probably arrived there after a journey of years or even decades. This means that the plastic on beaches and in coastal waters tends to be much “younger” than that polluting the open ocean. The study found that 79% of all the buoyant plastic in surface waters near the shore came from objects that were less than five years old. Meanwhile, microplastics found far offshore likely broke down from plastics that were created as long ago as the 1950s. For that reason, travelling out from shore is a bit like travelling back in time. The further you get from land, the older the plastic waste tends to be. The plastic spoon you find tangled in seaweed on the shore may only be a year old. Tiny particles in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean may have came from plastic that was produced during the Cold War.

      Designing new ways to make use of ocean plastic


 The reason why there seemed to be plastic missing from offshore waters is because so much of it accumulates in coastal waters, as nearshore currents keep it there. Only some of that plastic eventually filters out to the open ocean. Even if all the plastic that’s produced on land stopped reaching the ocean tomorrow, the researchers from The Ocean Cleanup predict that marine microplastic could still double by 2050, as the larger debris already out there breaks down. If the plastic debris that’s out there isn’t actively removed, floating islands of plastic waste could persist in the ocean for several centuries. Solving the ocean’s plastic problem will therefore take governments and manufacturers developing materials that can be re-used and disposed of properly. But it will also require removing the plastic that’s already floating in the sea.  Anyone who has ever taken part in a beach clean will appreciate that it can often feel like an uphill struggle, but the new study offers a note of encouragement. By removing plastic from the beach today, you’re permanently removing it from the cycle and preventing it from spending many decades in coastal waters or offshore. While much needs to be done, the people who give up their time to scour the sand for plastic pieces should be buoyed by the fact that their efforts do add up after all."
"Rishi Sunak is to announce a £3bn package of green investment to decarbonise public buildings and cut emissions from Britain’s poorly insulated homes as part of the government’s Covid-19 economic recovery plan. The chancellor will seek to use Wednesday’s summer statement on the economy to fend off criticism that his proposals lack ambition by insisting that he can “kick start” an environment-friendly revival through the creation of thousands of green jobs in the construction industry.  Sunak will say that the extra money for decarbonising houses, schools, hospitals, prisons and military bases will help the UK meet its target of being a carbon net zero economy by 2050, and is likely to say that further green spending will be announced later in the year. Opposition parties and environmental groups said, however, that the green investment pledge was inadequate to meet the challenge posed by global heating. Rosie Rogers, Greenpeace UK’s head of green recovery, said: “Surely this is just a down payment? The German government’s pumping a whopping £36bn into climate change-cutting, economy-boosting measures and France is throwing £13.5bn at tackling the climate emergency. £3bn isn’t playing in the same league.” Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: “We have consistently called or a recovery which has energy efficiency at its heart and will welcome any measures which achieve that. “But this needs to be part of a much broader and bigger scale strategy for getting on track for net zero, which includes a zero carbon army of young people being put back to work, investment in renewable energy and a plan to green our transport network. When the moment demands the most ambitious green recovery possible, the government has not so far risen to the challenge.” The Treasury said the summer statement was about “securing the recovery” and would be followed by two bigger events – a spending round and a budget – in the autumn. Sunak’s plan was on top of the £5bn of infrastructure spending announced by Boris Johnson last week. Of the £3bn, the chancellor will earmark £1bn to improve the insulation and energy efficiency of public buildings, and to invest in green heating technology. Sunak will also announce £50m to pilot new approaches to retrofitting social housing at scale to make them greener, through measures like heat pumps, insulation and double glazing, which the Treasury said would support landlords to improve the least energy efficient social rented homes in England. Warmer homes for social tenants could lower annual energy bills by £200 a year for some of the poorest households, the government estimates. The UK’s homes are the draughtiest in Europe, accounting for about a fifth of the UK’s carbon emissions, but sporadic attempts at insulation programmes by governments over the last two decades have failed to make much progress. With the focus of the spending statement on jobs, it is thought most of the remaining £2bn will be spent on creating “green” employment opportunities for construction workers. The Conservative manifesto at the 2019 election promised to invest £9.2bn on improving energy efficiency in homes, schools and hospitals, saying that this, if done at sufficient speed, would create around 100,000 jobs. “The government remains committed to decarbonising buildings to keep us on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050,” a treasury spokesperson said. “The funding expected to be announced this week represents a significant and accelerated down payment on decarbonising buildings, to help stimulate the economic recovery and create green jobs. Allocations for future funding will be determined in due course.” Rogers added: “Of course this money is better than nothing, but it doesn’t measure up to the economic and environmental crises. It’s not enough to create the hundreds of thousands of new green jobs that are needed. It’s not enough to insulate all of the homes and buildings that need to be kept warm and more energy efficient. It’s not enough to ‘build back greener’, and it’s certainly not enough to put us on track to tackle the catastrophic impacts of the climate emergency.” Miliband has previously called for a huge green investment programme to create jobs, particularly for young people, in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and to help tackle the climate emergency. Separately, the Liberal Democrats urged Sunak to zero-rate VAT on green products, including wind turbines, solar panels, bikes and e-bikes. The chancellor must not “miss this once-in-a lifetime opportunity to secure a green economic recovery”, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at business group the CBI, said: “Investment in green jobs and technology must be at the centre of our efforts to revive the economy.  “This £3bn package of measures will undoubtably fast-forward progress towards net-zero. With the government’s own manifesto promising £9.2bn on energy efficiency alone, we look forward to seeing the full details on delivery of its ambition to build back greener.”"

HadCRUT4, the last of the five monthly global datasets to report its February value, shows the same sharp drop in global temperature over the month as the other datasets.

Our dataset-of-datasets graph averages the monthly anomalies for the three terrestrial and two satellite temperature records. It shows there has still been no global warming this millennium. Over 13 years 2 months, the trend is zero.
 

Start any further back and the trend becomes one of warming – but not of rapid warming. The Archdruids of Thermageddon, therefore, can get away with declaring that there is no such thing as a Pause – but only just. Pause denial is now endemic among the acutely embarrassed governing class.
This month Railroad Engineer Pachauri denied the Pause: yet it was he who had proclaimed its existence only a year ago in Australia.
However, it is no longer plausible to suggest, as the preposterous Sir David King did in front of the House of Commons Environment Committee earlier this month, that there will be as much as 4.5 Cº global warming this century unless CO2 emissions are drastically reduced.
More than an eighth of the century has passed with no global warming at all. Therefore, from now to 2100 warming would have to occur at a rate equivalent to 5.2 Cº/century to bring global temperature up by 4.5 Cº in 2100.
How likely is that? Well, for comparison, HadCRUT4 shows that the fastest global warming rate that endured for more than a decade in the 20th century, during the 33 years 1974-2006, was equivalent to just 2 Cº/century.
Even if that record rate were now to commence, and were to continue for the rest of the century, the world would be only 1.75 Cº warmer in 2100 than it was in 2000.
The fastest supra-decadal warming rate ever recorded was during the 40 years 1694-1733, before the industrial revolution began. Then the Central England record, the world’s oldest and a demonstrably respectable proxy for global temperature change, showed warming at a rate equivalent to 4.3 K/century. Nothing like it has been seen since.
Even if that rapid post-Little-Ice-Age naturally-driven rate of naturally-occurring warming were to commence at once and persist till 2100, there would only be 3.75 Cº global warming this century.
Yet the ridiculous Sir David King said he expected 4.5 Cº global warming this century. Even the excitable IPCC, on its most extreme scenario, gives a central estimate of only 3.7 Cº warming this century. Not one of the puddings on the committee challenged him.
Meanwhile, the discrepancy between prediction and observation continues to grow. Here is the IPCC’s predicted global warming trend since January 2005, taken from Fig. 11.25 of the Fifth Assessment Report, compared with the trend on the dataset of datasets since then. At present, the overshoot is equivalent to 2 Cº/century.

It is this graph of the widening gap between the predicted and observed trends that will continue to demonstrate the absence of skill in the models that, until recently, the IPCC had relied upon.
Finally, it is noteworthy that the IPCC’s mid-range estimate of global warming from 1990 onward was 0.35 Cº/decade. The IPCC now predicts less than half that, at 0.17 Cº/decade. At that time, it was advocating a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions. It is now transparent that no such reduction is necessary: for the warming rate is already below what it would have been if any such reduction had been achieved or achievable, desired or desirable.
Within a few days, the RSS satellite record for March will be available. I shall report again then. So far, that record shows no global warming for 17 years 6 months.

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
There’s a much-cited paper (129 citations) from 1994 called “On the Observed Near Cancellation between Longwave and Shortwave Cloud Forcing in Tropical Regions” by J. T. Kiehl (hereinafter Kiehl1994), available here. The paper makes the following claim (emphasis mine):
ABSTRACT
Observations based on Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) satellite data indicate that there is a near cancellation between tropical longwave and shortwave cloud forcing in regions of deep convective activity. Cloud forcing depends on both cloud macrophysical properties (e.g., cloud amount, cloud height, etc.) and on microphysical properties (e.g., cloud particle size, particle shape, etc.). Hence, the near cancellation in the tropics could be due to either the macrophysical or the microphysical properties of these clouds, or a combination of these effects. 

Now, to me that’s a pretty curious and surprising claim. The paper says that both in the Indonesian Region, as well as over the entire tropical Pacific, deep convective tropical clouds have no net effect on radiation, ostensibly because the longwave (positive) and reflected shortwave radiation (negative) cancel each other out. Let me call this the “cancellation hypothesis”. Kiehl supports the cancellation hypothesis inter alia with his Figure 1:
Figure 1. The first figure in Kiehl1994. The vertical axis shows shortwave cloud forcing, which is the amount of sunlight reflected by clouds in watts per square metre (W m-2). The horizontal axis shows the longwave cloud forcing, which is the change in top-of-atmosphere longwave forcing from the clouds. By convention, the reflected solar radiation is shown as negative, presumably because it is cooling the earth. Data is from April 1985.
And that looks pretty convincing … but, despite the 129 citations of the paper, I’m a suspicious fellow who believes firmly in the famous fallibility of experts. So I thought I’d use the CERES data and see if the cancellation hypothesis held up. Figure 2 shows that result, for the same Indonesian Region used by Kiehl.
Figure 2. Replication of the Kiehl study, using the ten-year April averages for the specified region to remove annual variations. Each square symbol represents a 1°x1° gridcell (N = 1500).
Instead of one single month’s data, I’ve used the averages of the ten Aprils in the CERES dataset.
Now, as you can see from Figure 2, the Kiehl hypothesis of cancellation has a big problem. The CERES results do not bear out Kiehl’s claims in the slightest. Instead, they support my hypothesis that increased tropical clouds cool the surface. As you can see, on average the loss from the reflected sunlight is about 20% or so greater than the gain from increased IR. This means that there is no cancellation. Instead, the clouds have a net cooling effect.
The paper goes on to say:
One feature of the cloud radiative forcing obtained from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment ( ERBE) is the near cancellation between the longwave cloud forcing and the shortwave cloud forcing in tropical deep convective regions. This result was clearly shown by Kiehl and Ramanathan ( 1990) for the Indonesian convective region (here reproduced in Fig. 1 ). Further analysis of tropical deep convective regions of net cloud radiative forcing indicates that this is a ubiquitous feature that occurs over either ocean or land regions.
This is a more expansive claim than the one in the Abstract. Here the paper says that the cancellation happens over both land and ocean. So I thought I’d divide the Indonesian Region shown above into land and ocean regions. In addition, rather than average the months as in Figure 2, Figures 3 & 4 show all available April data for the entire time period. First, Figure 3 shows the land. I have colored the points by surface temperature of the gridcell.
Figure 3. As in Figure 2, but showing only the land. N=1,320.
Well, this shows that whatever might be happening in the Indonesian Region in the way of a linear relationship between reflected shortwave and longwave, it is definitely NOT happening over the land. The land shows little in the way of any relationship between shortwave and longwave.
Figure 4 shows the ocean data for the same Indonesian region.
Figure 4. As in Figure 2, but showing only the ocean. Note that the scale is slightly larger, to include all of the individual data. N=17,736
Well, this clarifies matters somewhat. First, about 40% of the land gridcells, but only about 10% of the ocean gridcells, have longwave cloud forcing greater than the shortwave forcing. Next, the land is pretty tightly clustered, with no apparent pattern. The ocean is different. Over the ocean the longwave is proportional to the shortwave … but it is a long ways from cancelling out. Instead, there’s a net cooling of -13.7 watts per square meter over the region. And the amount of cooling increases as the forcings increase. By the time the cloud reflections are up to 100 W m-2, the longwave is only up to 75 W m-2. That is a cooling from the clouds of about 25 W/m2, and not a cancellation under any meaning of the word.
In addition, there are a number of the warmest gridcells (red) which are on the left of the group (lots of reflection, little longwave).
Kiehl goes on to show his Figure 2, which compares the entire tropical Pacific region, from 10N 140E to 10S 90W. He shows a different kind of graph for this region, viz:
Figure 5. Kiehl Figure 2, showing the longwave and shortwave cloud forcing separately as functions of temperature.
Based on this graph, he makes the even more expansive claim that the cancellation of long-and shortwave radiation occurs across the Pacific, viz:
This figure illustrates that the cancellation between these two forcings occurs not only in the western tropical Pacific region of Fig. 1 but also across the entire tropical Pacific Ocean region. Even in regions of colder SSTs (298 K) the cancellation is apparent.
I found his style of graph in Figure 2 to be notably uninformative regarding the purported Pacific-wide cancellation. So I repeated his Figure 1 style of graph using the Pacific data, to see whether the forcings actually cancelled all across the Pacific. Figures 6 and 7 shows that result, for land and ocean, and reveals that there are large problems with this second claim as well.
Figure 6. As in Figure 2, but covering a larger area, the entire tropical Pacific Ocean as specified in the title. This figure shows land only. N=348.
Again, there is no clear pattern over the land, merely a cluster of data.
Figure 7. As in Figure 6, but covering ocean only. Note the slightly larger scale than in Figure 4. N=63,132.
This actually is pretty interesting. First off, again the ocean and land are different, with the land results clustered as in the Indonesian Region. Regarding the ocean, in only 5% of the gridcells does the longwave ever exceed the shortwave (area above the central diagonal line). In order for Kiehl’s cancellation hypothesis to be true, the average of a number of gridcells over an area would have to fall on the central diagonal line … which is clearly impossible with only 5% of them above the line.
Nor do things get better when we look at the entire dataset, and not just the April data. Figure 8 shows all of the data for the Pacific-wide area shown in Figure 7 (ocean only).
Figure 8. All months of data for the Pacific-wide area as in Figure 7
Next, rather than cancellation, there are a whole lot of gridcells where the longwave is smaller, and often much smaller, than the reflected shortwave. When there is solar reflection of a hundred watts per square metre, the longwave is only around sixty watts per square metre, for a full 40 W/m2 of cooling. And even on average the cooling is nearly 20W/m2 … not what we call cancellation on my planet.
Finally, his claim that “Even in regions of colder SSTs (298 K) the cancellation is apparent” is not upheld by the data. The temperature of 298 K [25°C] is shown in blue in Figure 7, and it is the farthest from cancellation of any of the data.
CONCLUSIONS
The main result is that the CERES data clearly and emphatically falsifies the cancellation hypothesis. In general, the longwave and shortwave are far from cancelling each other in the tropical deep convective areas.
A secondary result is that this clearly shows how the politicization of the field has affected the scientific process. Kiehl’s claims were very tempting to the theorists and modelers, because cancellation meant that they didn’t have to concern themselves with the deep convective processes, aka thunderstorms—the could simply repeat Kiehl’s claim that the shortwave and longwave cancelled each other out. And as a result, when more detailed data became available, the original claims of Kiehl1994 were never questioned.
Now, all we need is some automated method to notify the 129 people who cited the cancellation hypothesis in other scientific papers that the rumored cancellation has been cancelled for the duration …
All the best,
w.

One of the enduring fault lines in American politics has been over how to best increase economic growth. Conservatives and libertarians have generally argued for lower taxes and fewer regulations. Liberals have called for government investment in infrastructure and measures designed to boost consumer spending. Supply‐​side versus demand‐​side stimulus gets debated, and the impact of trade and immigration policies cleaves party lines. Even issues like unemployment insurance and education reform are argued about in terms of their contribution to a growing economy.



They may have wildly different ideas about how to get there, but all sides have agreed on the basic destination: a growing economy. Until recently.



Lately, on the Left a new strain of thought has risen that questions whether growth is a good thing after all. “Growth shouldn’t be any president’s economic goal,” writes former labor secretary Robert Reich. Reich complains that “almost all the gains from growth have gone to the richest 1 percent.” He goes on to suggest that rather than growing the economy, the government should be concerned with creating more jobs, even if that means sacrificing innovation or efficiency that might benefit the economy as a whole.





Some on the Left are questioning whether growth is a good thing after all.



There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, about Milton Friedman. While touring China, he came upon a team of nearly 100 workers building an earthen dam with shovels. Friedman pointed out that with a bulldozer, a single worker could create the dam in an afternoon. A Communist official replied, “Yes, but think of all the unemployment that would create.”



“Oh,” said Friedman, “I thought you were building a dam. If it’s jobs you want, then take away their shovels and give them spoons.”



Reich clearly has joined the spoon brigade.



Speaking of China: That also seems to be the attitude of the Left’s new intellectual hero, Thomas Piketty. In his now‐​famous book, _Capital in the Twenty‐​First Century_ , Piketty laments that economic growth in China has led to rising inequality; he is apparently indifferent to the fact that that economic growth has lifted billions of people out of poverty. Better, he seems to be saying, that we be equally poor than unequally rich.



It is one thing when these ideas are bandied about by pundits or academics, but they are also making their way into the political arena. Vermont senator and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is also critical of economic growth. He was asked directly: If the policies he was advocating were to “result in a more equitable distribution of income, but less economic growth, is that trade‐​off worth making?” Sanders replied forthrightly, “Yes.”



In fact Sanders has a host of reasons for opposing economic growth. Taking a Reich‐​like line, he believes that growth serves little purpose because most of the gains go to the rich. “If 99 percent of all the new income goes to the top 1 percent, you could triple it, it wouldn’t matter much to the average middle‐​class person. The whole size of the economy and the GDP doesn’t matter if people continue to work longer hours for low wages.”



Moreover, “you can’t just continue growth for the sake of growth in a world in which we are struggling with climate change and all kinds of environmental problems.” Besides, economic growth, according to Sanders, both stems from and leads to mindless consumerism. “You don’t necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country.”



So far, Hillary Clinton still talks about her desire for a growing economy. But with Sanders attracting large and enthusiastic crowds, and coming within ten points of Clinton in one poll in New Hampshire, one wonders how long that commitment will last. Indeed, already her policies have moved left; she has started espousing more redistribution, higher taxes, and increased regulation of business in ways that would almost certainly slow economic growth.



To be sure, the Republican candidates remain focused on economic growth. Jeb Bush says that he seeks an economy growing at least 4 percent a year. Marco Rubio calls for “a growing economy, not a growing government.” Scott Walker says that “nationally we need to have more talk about growth.” And Rand Paul explains that his new tax plan is “pro‐​growth.”



But even among Republicans, there are voices — especially among opponents of free trade and open immigration — that seem to put jobs or cultural values ahead of economic growth.



Economic growth has benefited us all, rich and poor alike, enormously. It’s easy to forget how different life was just a century ago, when only 20 percent of American homes had electricity, life expectancy was not even 55, and one out of ten children died before the age of 15. We no longer devote nearly half of our days simply to putting food on the table. Women, minorities, and the poor in particular are better off because we are a wealthier nation.



The difference between redistribution and growth is as stark as the difference between Venezuela and Hong Kong. It may well be a difference that we see debated in 2016.

"**The coronavirus crisis might be causing widespread economic upheaval around the world, but the world's biggest tech firms are thriving.**
Amazon sales soared 40% in the three months ending June, while Apple saw a surge in purchases of its iPhones and other hardware.
At Facebook, the number of people on its platforms, which include WhatsApp and Instagram, jumped by 15%.
The gains come as the firms face scrutiny over their size and power.
At a hearing in Washington on Wednesday, lawmakers grilled the companies about whether they were abusing their dominance to quash rivals, noting the sharp contrast between their fortunes and many other firms.
Their positions are likely to become even stronger, as the pandemic pushes even more activity online, said Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat who leads the committee.
""Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, these corporations already stood out as titans in our economy,"" he said.
""In the wake of COVID-19, however, they are likely to emerge stronger and more powerful than ever before.""
The gains weren't a surprise to analysts - though just how well many of the firms did, was.
At Amazon, the quarterly profit of $5.2bn (Â£4bn) was the biggest since the company's start in 1994 and came despite heavy spending on protective gear and other measures due to the virus.
""This is an exceptional quarter on all fronts under extreme circumstances,"" Moody's vice president Charlie O'Shea said of Amazon's blockbuster rise.
The e-commerce firm's sales surged 40% for the three months ending 30 June to $88.9bn (Â£67.9bn) - its strongest year-on-year growth in years. Profits rose to $5.2bn from 2.6bn for the same period in 2019.
The flood of online shopping has strained the firm's capacity. Amazon hired about 175,000 people in the quarter and is working to expand its warehouse space in anticipation of continued growth.
""We've run out of space,"" chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts about the results.
Meanwhile, Apple said quarterly revenues jumped 11% year-on-year to $59.7bn.
The shift to remote work and school helped drive demand for new devices, such as Macs and iPads, both of which saw double-digit gains. Profits hit $11.25bn, up from $10bn in the same period a year ago.
Apple said the release of the low-cost iPhone SE in April had helped to boost sales and put the electronics giant in a better position, despite the financial impacts of the coronavirus crisis.
""The last few months have underlined the importance of users - and households alike - to own better quality devices, connections and services,"" said Paolo Pescatore, tech analyst at PP Foresight. ""Apple smashed it.""
At Facebook, revenues rose 11% - slower than other quarters - but were still ahead of analysts' expectations, as small businesses continued to turn to the company to advertise. The firm's profits hit almost $5.2bn for the quarter.
The resilience was helped by a spike in users, which makes the firm attractive to advertisers, said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
The firm said 2.4 billion people were active on its social media platforms and messaging apps on average in June, up 15% from last year. That included nearly 1.79 billion daily active users on Facebook, up 12% year-on-year.
As lockdowns have eased, Facebook said it was ""seeing signs of normalisation in user growth and engagement"", warning those figures could flatten or decline in the months to come.
Ms Lund-Yates said the firm also remains vulnerable to social and political pressure, which could just as quickly push users away again.
""But this isn't the first time Facebook's navigated regulatory or social speed bumps, and it has deep pockets to throw at fixing problems,"" she said.
Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, was the weakest of the four.
The search giant said revenues were $38.3bn, down 2% from a year ago, as businesses cut back on ad spending.
It was the first year-on-year decline in quarterly revenue for the search giant, since Google became a publicly-listed company in 2004.
Profits dropped about 30% year-on-year to roughly $7bn. But even those falls failed to faze analysts, who had expected damage.
""We expected April to be the bottom of the digital ad market, with a return to growth in May and June, and these results suggest that acceleration was stronger than expected,"" eMarketer principal analyst Nicole Perrin said."
"International aviation and shipping emissions are likely to be included in the UK government’s net zero target, it has emerged – but not until after 2023. The intention to review carbon accounting emerged after ministers and advisers, including climate activists, held the first meeting of the Department for Transport’s net zero board.  The board includes representatives from business, technology, motor manufacturers and the transport industry, as well as campaigners, including a founder of Plane Stupid and a director of the International Council on Clean Transportation, which uncovered the VW diesel scandal. The team will help shape a transport decarbonisation plan, to be published later this year. Transport accounts for a third of the UK’s CO2 emissions, but the figure excludes international aviation and shipping. The DfT is understood to be considering the advice of the Committee on Climate Change, which last month again urged the government to include all such emissions in its targets. The DfT’s decarbonisation plan is expected to call for a change in policy, but only once the government has attempted to secure internationally binding reductions in emissions through the International Maritime Organisation, whose strategy will not be settled until 2023. The initial meeting, attended by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, transport minister Rachel Maclean, and the minister for clean growth, Kwasi Kwarteng, focused on steps for a green recovery from Covid-19. Shapps said the board would “play an integral part in our green recovery”. Maclean said the pandemic had led to people making huge changes in work and travel, adding: “We want to capitalise and build on the new habits people have developed, as well as champion the power of new, cleaner technologies on our road to a green recovery.” The government has promised to spend £2bn to increase cycling and walking, although board members pointed out that it was dwarfed by the £27bn promised for renewed road-building, with cars responsible for the vast majority of transport CO2 emissions. Stephen Joseph, a visiting professor at the University of Hertfordshire’s smart mobility unit, said: “Ministers were very clear that transport is a very big problem for climate – and the reductions they have planned only go halfway to where they need to get to by 2032.”"
"**Facebook has acknowledged that it needs to do more to combat racism on its platforms and is setting up two groups to examine its policies and algorithms.**
Instagram's Equity Team and Facebook's Inclusive Product Council will look for bias in algorithms and work to make both platforms ""safe and fair"" for all.
Facebook has been criticised for failure to crack down on racist groups.
Others have complained about the suppression of black voices on Instagram.
In a statement, Instagram's vice-president of product, Vishal Shah, said: ""The racial justice movement is a moment of real significance for our company. Any bias in our systems and policies run counter to providing a platform for everyone to express themselves.
""While we're always working to create a more equitable experience, we are setting up additional efforts to continue this progress.""
The details of how the two groups will work would be shared in coming months, Facebook said.
According to the US Pew Research Center, half of black users turn to social media to express political views or get involved in issues that matter to them.
Last month, Instagram's head Adam Mosseri acknowledged it was ""hearing concerns about whether we suppress black voices and whether our products and policies treat everyone equally"".
Black people on the platform were ""often harassed"", fearful of being ""shadow-banned"" and disagreed with content takedowns, he said in a blog.
Shadow-banning is the act of limiting the places that content appears on a platform, without the user realising.
Meanwhile rival platform Snap has launched its own investigation into racism within the company.
It follows comments from ex-employees who alleged in a Mashable article in June that there was a racist culture at the firm.
Snapchat has been criticised in the past for some of its filters, including one on the anniversary of the ending of slavery in the US which asked users to ""smile and break the chains"". The firm later apologised for any offence it might have caused.
Previously it was criticised for one which contorted facial features and gave users the appearance of slanted eyes, while a Bob Marley filter was called out for encouraging blackface."
"PACHINKOBy Min Jin Lee490 pp. Grand Central Publishing. $27. Min Jin Lee’s stunning novel “Pachinko”  —   her second, after “Free Food for Millionaires” (2007)  —   announces its ambitions right from the opening sentence: “History has failed us, but no matter. ” “Pachinko” chronicles four generations of an ethnic Korean family, first in   Korea in the early 20th century, then in Japan itself from the years before World War II to the late 1980s. The novel opens with an arranged marriage in Yeongdo, a fishing village at the southern tip of Korea. That union produces a daughter, Sunja, who falls in love at 16 with a prominent (and married) mobster. After Sunja becomes pregnant, a local pastor offers her a chance to escape by marrying him and immigrating together to his brother’s house in an ethnic Korean neighborhood in Osaka. Together, they embark into the fraught unknown. Pachinko, the    game ubiquitous throughout Japan, unifies the central concerns of identity, homeland and belonging. For the ethnic Korean population in Japan, discriminated against and shut out of traditional occupations, pachinko parlors are the primary mode of finding work and accumulating wealth. Called Zainichi, or foreign residents, ethnic Koreans are required to reapply for alien registration cards every three years even if they were born in Japan, and are rarely granted passports, making overseas travel nearly impossible. From a young age, Sunja’s oldest son sees being Korean as “a dark, heavy rock” his greatest, secret desire is to be Japanese. His younger brother, Mozasu, even after he accumulates great wealth through his pachinko parlors, confides to his closest Japanese friend: “In Seoul, people like me get called Japanese bastards, and in Japan, I’m just another dirty Korean no matter how much money I make or how nice I am. ” Mozasu’s son, Solomon, learns this too quickly after graduating from an American university. He returns to Tokyo on an expat package with the Japanese branch of a British investment bank, then is fired once his ethnic Korean connections are no longer needed for a business deal. Still, Solomon is of a new, less wounded generation. He believes there are still good Japanese people and sees himself as Japanese, too, “even if the Japanese didn’t think so. ” Like most memorable novels, however, “Pachinko” resists summary. In this sprawling book, history itself is a character. “Pachinko” is about outsiders, minorities and the politically disenfranchised. But it is so much more besides. Each time the novel seems to find its locus  —   Japan’s colonization of Korea, World War II as experienced in East Asia, Christianity, family, love, the changing role of women  —   it becomes something else. It becomes even more than it was. Despite the compelling sweep of time and history, it is the characters and their tumultuous lives that propel the narrative. Small details subtly reveal the characters’ secret selves and build to powerful moments. After Sunja arrives in Osaka, her modest life is underscored when she enters what is only the second restaurant of her life. When her husband, Isak, is finally cleared of   charges and released from jail looking “both new and ancient,” their oldest son is “unable to take his eyes off his father for fear he’d disappear. ” Their reunion is moving yet understated: Isak simply holds his son’s hand and says: “My dear boy. My blessing. ” Dozens more characters amplify the vortex of points of views: a hostess bar girl, a farmer who has “no wish for the war to end just yet” so that he can benefit from the higher   prices to realize “his grandfather’s dearest wish” of buying the adjoining land. The numerous shifts are occasionally jolting, but what is gained is a compassionate, clear gaze at the chaotic landscape of life itself. In this haunting epic tale, no one story seems too minor to be briefly illuminated. Lee suggests that behind the facades of wildly different people lie countless private desires, hopes and miseries, if we have the patience and compassion to look and listen."

Change in the climate debate? Climate models start converging towards reality
By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
[Translated, condensed by P. Gosselin]
On many occasions we have brought up the discrepancies between observed global data and the values of the latest IPCC climate models (CMIP5) – see here and here. The model values simply diverged well above the observations. A chart by Roy Spencer made this clear:

Figure 1: The deviation of model values from satellite observations up to 2013, Source: Roy Spencer.
Recently Thomas Mauritsen and Björn Stevens, a clouds and aerosols modeling expert of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, examined the matter. In a very recent paper appearing in Nature Geoscience (hereinafter MS15) titled “Missing iris effect as a possible cause of muted hydrological change and high climate sensitivity in models“, they took up the actual situation (a somewhat difficult to understand press release on this can be read here).
1) Apparently the models overreact to the greenhouse gas effect. Recent papers also have found from the observations a significantly lower value for forcing. The climate sensitivity (ECS) for a very long-term period after an increase in greenhouse gas is determined to be on average 3.3°C of warming while the observations indicate a value of about 2°C.
2) The global hydrological cycle is not taken correctly into account in the models (too small).
There’s also another phenomenon: According to the models, the troposphere in the tropics was supposed to warm up much more than at ground level. But this is not being observed, and we’ve written about this in an earlier post “Houston, we have a problem: We can’t find the hot spot“.
Here the authors searched for an explanation for the discrepancies. Perhaps a cooling effect was missing in the models. They found an explanation: an old hypothesis from Richard Lindzen and his colleagues from 2001: The earth has an “iris”, a negative feedback where more heat is released when there is more warming than when the temperature is cool. This mechanism, according to Lindzen, acts in the tropics and in the subtropics. It is illustrated as such in the paper:
 

Figure 2: At higher temperatures there are more thunderstorms over the ocean and the area without high level clouds (dry and clear) expands further and thus allows more heat to radiate off into space (strong OLR) than when temperatures are lower, i.e. when the iris is smaller. Source: Figure 1 from MS15.
This “self-regulation” of the earth’s temperatures proposed by Lindzen of course was rejected by “mainstream” climate science. Chambers et al. wrote in the Journal of Climate 2002:
As a result, the strength of the feedback effect is reduced by a factor of 10 or more. Contrary to the initial Iris hypothesis, most of the definitions tested in this paper result in a small positive feedback.”
Kevin Trenberth and colleagues rejected the iris-theory in the Geophysical Research Letters in 2010:
…and their [Lindzen et al.] use of a limited tropical domain is especially problematic. Moreover their results do not stand up to independent testing.”
The authors of the latest Nature article obviously had not been impressed by Trenberth’s claim, and made the effort of integrating Lindzen’s iris effect into an advanced model. The result is somewhat surprising.

The Tropical Hot Spot

Figure 3: The temperatures in the atmosphere according to the models, Source: Figure S7 from MS15.
The increase in the tropical temperature trends between 7 and 14 km elevation in the model without the iris (Figure 3 left) and with the iris (right). The modeled hot spot with profound effect at about 10 km and above has disappeared…which is very much like what the observations have been telling us:

Figure 4: The hot spot in the models without the iris and the observations. Source: “Climate4you“. The 300 hPa atmospheric pressure corresponds to an elevation of approx. 8 km, the 200 hPa approx. 10 km above sea level. The measured trend (dark red or blue), the modeled trend in the model mean without iris is dotted red.
The impact of the iris effect on EC

Figure 5: Crossplot of the ECS with negative effect of iris as temperature rises. The red point is the ECS of the model without iris. The blue plots are the values for the ECS in various strengths of the Iris. Source: Figure 3a of MS15.
The iris shifts the ECS of the used models from 2.81 to 2.21. That’s 22% less sensitivity with respect to the warming effect by greenhouse gases. Also the discrepancy in the hydrological cycle (basically the increase in precipitation due to warming) could be resolved by taking the iris into account.
Even when the impression has been given here from time to time that we distrust models, we point out that precisely in climatology models can be very useful when they are fed with all the right information. We are not able to experiment with the atmosphere and so we have to rely on computers. It is essential that the models accurately reflect reality and do not produce a fictitious world that supplies catastrophe scenarios.
Climate models are extremely complex, and thus it is all the more critical that their programming be clean and that all the possible physical factors be correctly taken into account. The latest paper shows that modeling has taken a step in the right direction. It shows 22% less climate sensitivity due to the iris component.
Not everyone was happy to hear this news. Kevin Trenberth was quoted saying the following words (translated from the German):
The paper is poorly written and misleading. It wasn’t necessary to blow the iris horn.”
Trenberth seemed almost infuriated:
The authors even wrote it in the damn title.”
What fear has suddenly gripped the “climate establishment”? Could it be that among policymakers the word is out that the climate catastrophe has been called off?
Björn Stevens’ research results may go down as being the turning point in the history of climate science debate.

It’s also appearing in the main media elsewhere.
Berlin’s leftist daily Online Tagesspiegel here reports comprehensively on the German Green Party’s troubled past involving it’s earlier advocacy of pedophilia and practice by some of its former leading members, see background here, here, here and here.
Green Party Chairwoman Bettina Jarasch has just publicly apologized for what she calls an “institutional failure,” Tagesspiegel writes, as a commission report on the matter has been presented. 
“On behalf of the Berlin Greens, we ask for foregiveness,” said Jarasch.
The Tagesspiegel adds:
In the Berlin state association of the Alternativen Liste, the forerunner organization of the Green Party, there was massive sexual abuse of children.”
The Greens’ advocacy of pedophilia rights was part of the party’s platform in the 1980s and early 1990s as it pushed neo-liberal ideas like “free and open relationships”. It still remains unclear as to why the Germany’s top environmental party took so long to issue an apology.

1000 child victims of sexual abuse
The number of victims is not known. However one Green Party Berlin parliamentarian and author of the report, Thomas Birk, in March mentioned “up to 1000 victims”, though he said the figure was “speculative”. The report itself gives releases no figure.
Current Green party official Daniel Wesener said that there were at least two repeat offenders who were tolerated within the party, one was convicted in 13 cases.
Currently the child sex abuse within the Green party is now under investigation by a special commission. The Green Party leaders pledge their full cooperation and to provide compensation to victims who step forward.
According to the Tagesspiegel, the investigation shed light into an “abuse network” within the forerunner of the Green party, Alternativen Liste, which included at least three leading figures who set up a “youth center” in Kreuzberg recreational center.
According to witnesses, they abused numerous youths who had been recruited at elementary schools.”
Today Green Party officials insist that the abuse, however, did not take place within the party structure itself.
Though some media outlets such as the Tagesspiegel reported on the story, much of the German media has been pretty mute on the topic.

"During her pregnancy, she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana. With her fiancé’s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell morning sickness before going to work at a sandwich shop. When sciatica made it unbearable to stand during her   shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break. “I wouldn’t necessarily say, ‘Go smoke a pound of pot when you’re pregnant,’” said Stacey, now a    mother in Deltona, Fla. who asked that her full name be withheld because   marijuana is illegal in Florida. “In moderation, it’s O. K. ” Many pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers  —   another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health. Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient  —   tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC  —   can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in breast milk. “There is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it’s actually safe,” said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in   pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use. In the federal  survey, published online in December, almost 4 percent of    said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2. 4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month.) Young    were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7. 5 percent of   to    said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44. Evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb. In Pittsburgh,    born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. At age 10, children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention. Most troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers. “Prenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,” said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion. “Even early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,” said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. “Those are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition. ” It is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even eventually reducing I. Q. “The effects are not dramatic, but that doesn’t mean they are not important,” said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. “It could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B. ” “You could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,” she added. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic. Of five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study published online in December in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did. Until recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered nothing. “I don’t think public health officials should be alarming people,” said Marian Jarlenski, the study’s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. “They just have to say, ‘There have been studies done, and there is some risk. ’” In a statement, C. D. C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero. “While current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,” the agency said. Dr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new report on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis “does confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes. ” Some of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious birth defects. “That’s why some providers and lay people alike think there’s no effect,” said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, “Just because they don’t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn’t mean the baby’s neurological development is not impacted. ” Most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. “All those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren’t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,” said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington’s fetal alcohol and drug unit. “We need to do a whole lot more research now. ” There are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women  —   instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord  —   and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself. Few realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother’s body for weeks, if not months. It’s not known whether the fetus’s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit. To find out whether that’s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an   at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients. Medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When    admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all. Pregnant women aren’t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture. Depression, anxiety, stress, pain, nausea and vomiting were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 survey of   mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users a third were pregnant. “Women are thinking of this as medical marijuana in that they are treating some condition,” said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches substance abuse in pregnancy. “If you’re going to consider it like medicine,” she said, “then treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it. ” Stacey’s son just had his first birthday. He’s walking, talking and   and she isn’t worried about his development. She still smokes pot  —   indeed, her son plays on a rug emblazoned with a marijuana leaf. But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now. “I don’t have to smoke as much anymore,” she said."
"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump takes medication for three ailments, including a   drug to promote hair growth, Mr. Trump’s longtime physician, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, said in a series of recent interviews. The other drugs are antibiotics to control rosacea, a common skin problem, and a statin for elevated blood cholesterol and lipids. Dr. Bornstein, who spoke by telephone in four interviews over the past month, also said that Mr. Trump takes a daily baby aspirin to reduce the risk of a heart attack. Over all, he pronounced Mr. Trump healthy and his medical care “as exactly up to date. ” Dr. Bornstein granted the interviews after The New York Times asked him to discuss his role in Mr. Trump’s care and to clarify and expand on earlier statements he made about his patient’s health during the presidential campaign. In recent decades, The Times has interviewed presidents, presidential candidates and their doctors about their health. At 70, Mr. Trump is the oldest person to become president. White House officials declined to comment on Wednesday night on the information provided by Dr. Bornstein, and would not say whether he was still Mr. Trump’s physician. The disclosure that Mr. Trump uses a   drug to maintain growth of his scalp hair, which has not been publicly known, appears to solve a riddle of why Mr. Trump has a very low level of prostate specific antigen, or PSA, a marker for prostate cancer. Mr. Trump takes a small dose of the drug, finasteride, which lowers PSA levels. Finasteride is marketed as Propecia to treat   baldness. Dr. Bornstein said he also took finasteride and credited it for helping maintain his own   hair and Mr. Trump’s hair. “He has all his hair,” Dr. Bornstein said. “I have all my hair. ” Dr. Bornstein, 69, has a private practice on the Upper East Side of New York, was educated at Tufts University for college and medical school, did his fellowship in gastroenterology at Yale, and was Mr. Trump’s personal physician since 1980. He said that he had had no contact with Mr. Trump since he became president, and that no one from Mr. Trump’s White House staff had asked for copies of the medical records that he has kept for the last 36 years, or called to discuss them. Dr. Bornstein said that Mr. Trump had gone to his East Side office for annual checkups, colonoscopies, and other routine tests every year since 1980. Before that, Mr. Trump was a patient of Dr. Bornstein’s father, Dr. Jacob Bornstein. At times in the interviews, Dr. Bornstein was moody, ranging from saying that Mr. Trump’s health “is none of your business” to later volunteering facts. He also meandered, referring to his longtime study of Italian and stories about medical schools floating cadavers to an island off the waters of New York. He said he liked the attention he got from friends now that he was publicly known as Mr. Trump’s doctor but disliked “the fun made of me” by the news media and strangers who have thrown objects at his office window and who have yelled at him on Park Avenue. Dr. Bornstein’s first brush with the public was in December 2015, when he released a hyperbolic   letter about Mr. Trump’s health. “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” Dr. Bornstein wrote. He offered scant medical evidence for his prediction beyond saying Mr. Trump had no significant illness and nothing that required treatment outside of his office. Eight months later, Dr. Bornstein stirred controversy by saying he wrote the letter in five minutes while a limousine sent by Mr. Trump waited outside. A second letter in September 2016 was more sober, although it omitted a number of details that would be part of a customary summary of a patient’s health. The letter did say that Mr. Trump is    weighs 236 pounds, has a normal blood pressure of   and takes a drug called rosuvastatin (marketed as Crestor) to lower cholesterol and other lipids. Dr. Bornstein did not say how high the lipids were before the statin therapy, but he reported that the levels were in the normal range in recent tests: cholesterol, 169 HDL cholesterol, 63 LDL cholesterol, 94 triglycerides, 61. In both letters, Dr. Bornstein wrote that Mr. Trump’s PSA level was 0. 15. The low number led urologists not connected with Mr. Trump to say that he must have been treated for an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer. But Dr. Bornstein said in the interviews that Mr. Trump had had neither ailment and that his PSA level is low because of Propecia. In the interviews, Dr. Bornstein said he refilled Mr. Trump’s prescriptions for a   tetracycline, a common antibiotic, to control rosacea. The skin ailment can cause easy blushing or flushing with visible blood vessels. It also can spread over the face, and sometimes the chest and back. In different forms it can resemble acne and cause bumps. Dr. Bornstein also addressed questions about Mr. Trump’s recent description of himself as a “germophobe. ’’ Dr. Bornstein said he had never discussed that phenomenon with Mr. Trump, but “we are very careful to keep the examining rooms spotlessly clean, which we do anyway. ’’ He added, “He always stands there and changes the paper on the table himself” after an examination. “Other than that, nothing. ” Dr. Bornstein said that he was sure that Mr. Trump was up to date on an H. I. V. test, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all adults get at least once. He said if he became the White House doctor he doubted that he would include in Mr. Trump’s annual checkup any psychometric tests as a base line for potential dementia. Mr. Trump’s father, Fred, suffered from Alzheimer’s disease in his eighties and a number of experts have urged that older political leaders undergo such tests. Dr. Bornstein also said he had cared for Mr. Trump’s first and third wives, and occasionally for the second. “I am probably the only person in the world who has every phone number for him and all the wives,” Dr. Bornstein said. About a month ago, Dr. Bornstein said he told Mr. Trump’s secretary, Rhona Graff, “You know, I should be the White House physician. ” Past presidents like Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush brought their own doctors to the White House, but others have used a White House physician. Dr. Bornstein was invited to Mr. Trump’s inaugural, although he said it was not as pleasant an experience as he expected. He had to walk a long way to a spot where he thought there would be a chair  —   he said he has a painful back ailment and nerve damage to a leg  —   but when he got there, there was no chair. He stood behind a tree and “never heard anyone speak because I was so uncomfortable from my back and being cold. ” He felt, he said, “absolutely miserable. ” It seemed to take forever to leave because of the heavy security, he said. The situation was the same at an inaugural ball where there were no tables and chairs. So, he said, unable to chat comfortably with others, he and his wife, Melissa, returned to their hotel early."

The European EV experience of choosing renewable energy over fossil fuels has, so far, proved economically unsustainable. The Dog and Lemon Guide says that hybrids are “nice in theory, shame about the reality”. 



“Many of the sales of hybrids in America are to people who simply want to be able to use car pool lanes on the motorway, and/or because the hybrid’s heavy extra cost was subsidised by the US government. 



**We’d love to say that hybrids offer a significant improvement over the conventional car, but we can’t because it’s simply not true.”**



Until technology catches up with clean green ideology, European governments are also subsidizing EV purchases to demonstrate that their countries are walking the talk.



“Europe’s car makers, spooked by the imminent mortal threat to profits from European Union (EU) regulations to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, **called for governments to raise subsidies on electric car purchases to stimulate sales.**



The European Auto Manufacturers Association, known by its French acronym ACEA, pointed out that sales of battery only electric cars and plug-in hybrids vary widely across the EU, from **a market share of 2% in Germany last year, the continent’s biggest car and SUV market, to Poland’s just 0.2%**. **Britain notched up electrically charged vehicle market share of 2.5%, and France 2.1%.”**



Good old Poland, a standout in a continent cluttered with self-destructing nations of do-gooders can be described as “capitalism with a socialist face” has rejected EVs. Poland is a very good example of how to swim against the tide and do it well. They provide better inspiration for us than the UN ideals our current government is peddling. The Poles never bought into EVs because, **financially, EVs don’t stack up.**



At the other end of the scale is a country that swallowed whole the CO2 myth and invested heavily in EVs, Norway.



“Socialist oil and gas producer Norway, outside of the EU, has an **electric vehicle market share this year of about 50%.**



 **It uses tax incentives to boost electric sales and big tax penalties to curb the sale of internal combustion engine-powered vehicles. There are bus lane, city access and parking bonuses for electric car users.”**



The Norwegian government can pat itself on the back and ignore that Norwegians are simply paying lip service. They are not giving up their fossil-fuelled vehicles at all, they have a foot in each camp. 



“Many Norwegians also suffer from “range anxiety”, **clinging on to a gas-guzzling SUV large enough to carry their cross-country skis and other kit to the clean air of their mountain cabins**.



Christina Bu, secretary general of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association, says **70% of its 60,000 members also own a fossil-fuel car** and the transition to fully electric cannot happen overnight.”



Do we really want to spend our hard-earned taxpayer dollars following suit? No doubt, in time, technology will provide economically viable EVs, but we are not there yet, despite international pressure to conform.



Between an idealistic prime minister who wants to be seen leading the world in climate change (bugger the farmers) and a UN using the climate change myth to redistribute wealth, we are assaulted from without and within on EVs.



Overseas EV owners happily accept EV subsidies while hanging onto their fossil-fueled vehicles and ignoring the threat of ridiculous self-imposed financial penalties further down the track. 



“Currently, battery-electric car purchasers in Britain get a $4,500 subsidy, in Germany $4,400 and France up to $8,500. In the U.S., car buyers get a $7,500 tax break, until the manufacturer’s electric car sales reach 200,000.



According to a report from investment researcher Jefferies in August, if the auto industry makes no progress curbing CO2 from 2018 towards meeting the EU’s 2020/21 regulations, **it faces fines totalling the equivalent of $36 billion, twice its estimated profits, and be forced to raise prices up to 10%**.



And according to ACEA, **2018 CO2 emissions actually rose 1.6%** , as sales of diesel-powered vehicles slid, and **demand for bigger gas-guzzling SUVs spiked.”**



Join the sensible movement quietly thumbing their noses at getting rid of petrol vehicles. If you’re in the market for a new car buy the biggest one you can possibly afford and drive around in style and comfort. 



You won’t regret it, and you won’t be alone. Until the automotive industry offers financially viable EVs, check out the Dog and Lemon in Guide for the biggest, meanest beast you can possibly afford and enjoy!

"PEARL RIVER DELTA, China  —   As Wong   stands on the deck of the traditional Chinese wooden junk he is building in Shenwan, a cluster of fish ponds and factories in the Pearl River Delta of southern China, he shouts to be heard over the shriek of metalwork from steel ships that are being worked on nearby. “It’s like a piece of art,” said Mr. Wong, a bronzed    with stony hands and a quick grin, describing what he loves about the   boats with the batwing sails that he so rarely gets to build. A native of the delta region, Mr. Wong in 1982 swam for two hours from nearby Zhuhai, on China’s mainland, to what was then the Portuguese colony of Macau to escape China’s strict Communist government. Once there he set up an early incarnation of Yi Hap Shipyard, a builder of wooden junks, which symbolize the delta and the maritime culture that drove China’s early growth. “Not many people are   wooden junks anymore,” Mr. Wong said. “I wish more people would. ” Within the next few months, the junk, the Dai Cheung Po  —   also known as the Aqua Luna II  —   will unfurl its   sails above its high stern and low bow and join its smaller sister, the Cheung Po Tsai, or the Aqua Luna I, already in Victoria Harbor in Hong Kong, to offer parties and dinners. It is one of a few of these traditional ships with sails being made by one of the last remaining junk builders in China. “The building tradition is more or less moribund,” said Stephen Davies, a former director of the Hong Kong Maritime Museum. Yet the style remains traditional, “insofar as they are still doing what Grandpa did, and before him,” he said. The new junk is made of Southeast Asian ironwood and teak and cost about $1. 3 million to build. It was commissioned by a restaurant group in Hong Kong, which lies about 50 miles east of Shenwan on the edge of the delta where the river’s silty water turns ocean blue. Also in Hong Kong is the Dukling, a classic,   junk that dates from 1955. It sank once and was recently refurbished. Since June, its owners have offered tours of Hong Kong’s waters, reflecting how junks today are used mostly for tourism and private parties. They are three of only a handful of junks that remain in the delta, replaced long ago by stouter wooden fishing vessels without sails, speedboats and huge container ships. The   pirate Cheung Po Tsai, or Cheung Po “the Kid,” who crisscrossed the delta pillaging and later joined the Qing dynasty imperial navy, sailed a ship that looked similar to his namesakes, though its sails may have been a yellow woven bamboo, not red. The red color is largely a flourish, Mr. Davies said. The life of the delta is partly interlaced because of junks, which were once numerous with their fanlike silhouettes, trading down into Southeast Asia and up the coast of China. The junk  —   the word’s origins are murky, with Chinese, Malay and Portuguese cited as influences  —   may have assumed its iconic, curved hull and sails about 1, 000 years ago, during the Song dynasty, though written records are scarce. Captivated by the junk’s beauty, David Yeo, the founder and owner of Aqua Restaurant Group, commissioned a Hong Kong master boat builder, Au Wai, to conceptualize and direct the construction of the Aqua Lunas and to work with Mr. Wong in Shenwan. The first was launched in 2006, and unlike junks of the past, both are   and their sails are decorative. “He has made more commercial junk boats than anyone else in Hong Kong. He is a master of a true art form,” Mr. Yeo said in an email. “An art form that is sadly dying out in Hong Kong today. ” Mr. Au’s life reflects the sweep of delta geography. He is unsure where he was born but knows his father was from Guangdong Province in China, through which the Pearl River runs. Known as Ah Sin  —   the honorific and name translate as Dear Magician, for his talent  —   Mr. Au, 85, grew up poor in Hong Kong. In his boatyard on Hong Kong Island, in the eastern district of Shau Kei Wan, he points to photographs of wooden ships of all kinds that he has built since being apprenticed to an uncle at the age of 13: simple “ ” motorboats and corporate junks that carry some design elements of the traditional junk but without sails. Beyond the wood shavings, the harbor glitters in the sun. Fishing boats draw up outside to deliver their catch to the   Shau Kei Wan wholesale fish market. “I was very naughty as a boy, and no one could control me,” Mr. Au said in Cantonese, the local language. Barely a teenager, he sold fish on the streets. “I did what I wanted. So my family said, ‘You should look for a special skill,’” he said. “An uncle was the owner of a shipyard and also a member of the ship association. ” His son, Au Sai Kit, works with him, but because his son has no children, the family tradition will probably end there. Hardly anyone in Hong Kong is willing to do manual labor, the elder Mr. Au said, so he has to look to places like Shenwan, where he and his son travel regularly to confer with Mr. Wong and his team of workers. Building a luxury junk is a labor of love, Mr. Au said. “We take the wood piece by piece, fit them together in a curve, measure each piece and cut it,” he said. Copper nails are used to hammer the hull together. No other metal or artificial materials are used. It takes about a year to build a traditional junk, Mr. Wong said. Once junks were made from camphor wood and pine from   Fujian Province, said Mr. Davies, the former museum director. “They were simple to build. That was the genius of the hull design,” he said. But they had flaws. “The hull is only joined together by nails, so you can’t have one high sail. You need   rigging,” he said. “They had to keep adding sails to make the junk sail in a straight line. ” The idea of a Chinese junk has been romanticized, Mr. Davies said. “Junks were brutally hard work. The grunt work  —   it took 14 members of crew to work the sails. It was pure sweat,” he said. But Mr. Davies concedes that the traditional Chinese junk remains iconic. “That sweep down to the bow, the fan in profile, with the masts that create this beautiful arc along the top. The fully battened, standing rigging. There is just a beautiful harmony in looking at it,” he said."

For the past three years, the left have been gibbering about “Nazis”, “fascists”, and a “Return to the 1930s”. It’s all been a load of tosh, of course. Except, now, it’s on the verge of coming to pass.



A weakened democracy run by a divided, ineffectual party is being torn apart by a divisive foreign policy issue. A fanatical, anti-Semitic, socialist is waiting in the wings. Despite the fact that this swivel-eyed zealot is deeply unpopular with everyone except his own fanatical core of followers, the foolish, self-indulgent shenanigans of the political class may yet end up accidentally placing the reins of power in his fevered hands.



Except, this isn’t Weimar Germany, torn apart by resentment over Versailles, this is modern Britain, being torn apart by Brexit. [Jeremy Corbyn,](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/07/for-the-many-not-the-jew/) as nasty a piece of work as ever a democracy has ever produced, waits for the keys to Number Ten to fall in his lap.



Former Australian Labor politician Michael Danby has seen first-hand the festering creep of [anti-Semitism in the left.](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/the-insidious-creep-of-anti-semitism-in-australia/) He also knows what it’s like to be in a party running for election with a deeply unpopular leader. Australia got lucky, though, and roundly rejected Bill Shorten. Britain may not.



Over five years his party has tolerated, indeed licensed, anti-Jewish bigotry, even Holocaust denial. Corbyn is sinister, not a daffy crank. He and the Labour zeitgeist he has empowered have driven out lifelong Jewish members, marginalised the Jewish community and engendered such a climate of hate that there’s an official investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission into Corbyn’s party.



On the public record are 150 cases of Corbyn candidates or members expressing the foulest anti-Semitic bile, but nothing has been done. No wonder only 7 per cent of Jews will vote Labour; 40 per cent of the 300,000-strong community told pollsters they will emigrate if Corbyn wins.



In public life I have always been the first and hardest for persecuted minorities that don’t advocate violence — Uighers, Bahai, Tibetans, Muslim Darfuris and the 300,000 in North Korean concentration camps. This sense of fairness, this sympathy with the vulnerability of minorities, I believe, lies behind much of the decent centre of the British public’s grave doubts about Corbyn and his entourage. Hopefully it makes him unelectable.



Hopefully.



The nightmare scenario is that the Conservatives will screw the election so badly that they fail to secure a majority.



If the Conservatives don’t win, then Jeremy Corbyn does. It’s as simple as that. Boris Johnson becomes prime minister or Jeremy Corbyn becomes prime minister.



It’s quite a stretch for Labour to win a majority from where things are. You can never be sure but I don’t think that will happen. However, Labour doesn’t need a majority to take power. It just needs the Conservatives not to have one.



If the horse-trading for minority begins, the fervent denials from the Lib-Dems that they would ever partner with Corbyn will vanish like a Jewish business on Kristallnacht. The odious nationalist-socialist Nicola Sturgeon will deliver Scotland into Corbyn’s hands.



If this government doesn’t win a majority, the overwhelming chance is that it will fall. Which pretty much means Jeremy Corbyn.



And the left’s hysterical predictions of a “return to the 1930s” will finally come true – because the left made it happen

The number one difference between the Left and the Right is that **the Left do not care about upsetting people.** They are not poll driven fruit cakes. John Key was the best example of the difference between the Left and the Right. Instead of defending right-wing or conservative principles and drawing lines that he would not cross he did whatever the polls told him the people wanted. If the poll that week said that he would lose popularity if he stuck to what National had campaigned on then he would not pursue it. 



Look at the anti smacking law and Working for Families. Key was going to revise them yet **it never happened once he was in power.** He called Working for Families **“Communism by stealth”** while he was in opposition yet **he extended it** when in government. Simon Bridges has voted for the Zero Carbon Bill while in opposition and has said that he will “fix it” when National is in power. I am not holding my breath. The reality is that it is only the left that has the balls to dismantle laws put in place by the previous government.



The first thing Labour did when it was in power, was to **take away the tax cuts**. Zap gone. They didn’t muck around. They didn’t care about our feelings. They were not afraid to upset people.



Under John Key National transformed into Labour lite because Mr Popularity wanted to stay popular by not upsetting people. National under Simon Bridges is trying to follow in John Key’s footsteps by not rocking the boat.



Jacinda Ardern on the other hand doesn’t care who she upsets. She is on a globalist, socialist path and she is sticking to it. She is not going to change her direction even if she loses some popularity points doing so. She believes in what she is doing and while she has the power to makes changes she will make them. Obviously she gets stopped by NZ First on occasion but everyone knows that had she been able to she would have ploughed ahead with the [Capital Gains Tax](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/lies-damned-lies-and-capital-gains-tax/). She didn’t care about upsetting people then and she doesn’t care now. She may have kicked the can down the road with regard to farmers and the Zero Carbon Bill but we all know that she intends to shaft them if she is still in power after the next election.



Simon Bridges on the other hand is wearing a green tie and going all in on the bogus Climate Change nonsense. The difference between the Left and Right in New Zealand couldn’t be more stark.

" There is a serious risk that parts of England will run out of water within 20 years, MPs have warned. The public accounts committee said the bodies responsible for water in the UK had “taken their eye off the ball” and the scale of leakage – more than 3bn litres a day – was “wholly unacceptable”.  The committee’s report is damning of the water companies, which were privatised in 1989, accusing them of being “ponderous” and having made no progress in reducing leaks for two decades. The report said: “There is a serious risk that some parts of the country [England] will run out of water within the next 20 years … The responsible bodies – the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs [Defra], the Environment Agency and Ofwat have collectively taken their eye off the ball and urgent action is now required if we are to have a reliable water supply in the years ahead.” MPs’ criticism of the performance of water companies and the regulators, Ofwat and the Environment Agency, comes after a Guardian investigation revealed the nine privatised water companies in England released raw sewage into rivers via storm drains more than 200,000 times in 2019. MPs on the public accounts committee said chalk streams had suffered from the release of sewage from combined sewer overflows into them by the water companies. “The Environment Agency has prosecuted Thames Water on a number of occasions for breaching the conditions of its permits and allowing sewage to enter rivers from its treatment plants. Major infrastructure programmes also pose a threat,” the report said. Taking water from chalk streams was also heavily criticised. “The Environment Agency must balance the need to preserve the environment by maintaining flows with meeting the demand for water,” MPs said. The MPs said partnership grants up to £882,000 were provided to charities and stakeholder groups in 2020-21 for the improvement of chalk streams and their habitats. But the report said the Environment Agency should examine whether that was enough to deal with the “clear and present danger” to chalk streams. The report said the government had shown a lack of leadership in getting to grips with all of the issues threatening the water supply. Meg Hillier, the chair of the committee, said: “It is very hard to imagine, in this country, turning the tap and not having enough clean, drinkable water come out – but that is exactly what we now face. Continued inaction by the water industry means we continue to lose one fifth of our daily supply to leaks. “Empty words on climate commitments and unfunded public information campaigns will get us where we’ve got the last 20 years: nowhere. Defra has failed to lead and water companies have failed to act: we look now to the department to step up, make up for lost time and see we get action before it’s too late.” The report called on the government to provide more guidance to water companies on the level of investment that was necessary to ensure resilience by 2050 and how they should balance this in their business plans with pressure to reduce consumer bills. It said the scale of leaks, at 3bn litres a day, was wholly unacceptable. “Water leakage is now a hugely pressing problem,” MPs said. “No one organisation has got a thorough grip on dealing with this issue and driving the change necessary. [Defra] urged water companies in 2016 to make tackling leakage a much higher priority. However, there has still been little progress.” The committee called on Ofwat and Defra to be more active in ensuring that water companies meet targets to reduce leaks. It said the companies must be held to account with the publication of league tables from December 2020 showing their performance on tackling leakage against the targets set. MPs also said the government must urgently develop a plan, with adequate funding, to increase public awareness of the need to save water."
"One of Britain’s most famous architects is under fire for agreeing to design an airport and terminal in Saudi Arabia despite signing a climate emergency manifesto that called for an “urgent need for action” on climate change. Norman Foster’s design firm, Foster and Partners, was one of the founding signatories of the profession’s Architects Declare manifesto last year. However, The Architects’ Journal last week revealed that several new Foster and Partners projects in Saudi Arabia have caused controversy in the profession over their links to the aviation industry. Last year the practice won the design contract for an airport for a luxury resort, known as the Red Sea Project, in Saudi Arabia. And last month it was also revealed that it had put forward a proposal to build a terminal and control tower to serve a similar project: the Amaala luxury resort. Amaala is described as being ‘akin to a private members’ club’ and is currently being built on a 400,000 hectare site along Saudi Arabia’s north-west coast. The resort’s airport could be used by up to 1 million passengers a year after the resort’s opening, currently scheduled for 2023. Foster’s involvement in these projects has infuriated climate-concerned architects who joined Foster in signing the Architects Declare manifesto to “raise awareness of the climate and biodiversity emergences and the urgent need for action”. The manifesto also called for the establishment of “climate and biodiversity mitigation principles as the key measures of our industry’s success”. Helping the aviation industry to expand runs counter to these aspirations, warns a group of architects, the Architects Climate Action Network (Acan), who have demanded an explanation from Foster and Partners over its plans. The campaign group says the Saudi projects run counter to its declared commitment to protect the planet against the current climate change crisis being triggered by rising carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning. The group has also announced it will be pressing all UK architecture practices to end involvement with the aviation industry. “Anything that encourages the expansion of the aviation industry and the associated rise in the burning of fossil fuel should be viewed as being off-limits for architects concerned about the rate at which our planet is warming,” said a spokesperson for Acan. “It is as simple as that. We should be working to bring about a moratorium on the expansion of air travel.” Foster and Partners is famous for his design of spacious, sleek steel and glass buildings. These include London’s St Mary Axe building, popularly known as The Gherkin; City Hall, London; and the Great Court in the British Museum. Contacted by the Observer last week, Foster and Partners said it would not be responding to the criticisms made against them by campaigners."
"“Do you think they hear us? We’ll make them hear us!”. This was the rallying call Greta Thunberg gave to 250,000 people in New York’s packed streets, and millions worldwide who were taking part in the largest climate protest in history. In political chambers and on the streets, her cutting and inspiring words have awakened countless people to the climate and ecological emergencies. But beyond them, her voice contains a message that’s just as powerful. The sound of Thunberg’s voice has become as distinctive as her bluntly precise rhetoric and diminutive figure, as evidenced by her recent uncredited opening monologue on indie rock band The 1975’s album, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. There’s a certain poetic justice here. After first learning of the environmental crisis facing the planet, Thunberg was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, depression, and selective mutism, and describes herself as “only talking when necessary”. The very presence of her voice in the public sphere alone therefore signals the urgency of the climate and ecological crises. And in making her voice heard, its unique characteristics tell their own important story. The human voice is like a fingerprint made of sound waves. Unique to each speaker, its composition is determined by an array of factors ranging from the size, age and sex of the speaker’s body to their emotional state and social background. As a result, when a person vocalises, the voice connects the individual to the collective. When we speak, we carry and communicate our own personal identity to the community we enter. When we listen, we’re listening not only to the meaning of the words spoken but also the non-linguistic information communicated by the speaker’s sonic fingerprint. The most salient characteristic of Thunberg’s vocal fingerprint is perhaps her age. Just as Malala Yousafzai’s youthful tones gave her drive for female education such sway, Thunberg’s voice is a clear reminder of her 16 years – and by extension, the adolescence of the thousands of school strikers she has galvanised. She frequently frames the climate crisis as a generational conflict between the adults who are exacerbating the problem and the children who will pay the price. It is the youth in her voice, over and above her chastising words, that makes this role reversal so powerful. The political landscape surrounding the climate and ecological crises is constantly changing. So is the human voice. How she alters her approach to public speaking as her voice shifts into adulthood could be important if she is to keep having an impact – she will only sound like a student for so long. The wide reach of Thunberg’s public speeches also turn an issue too often expressed with faceless statistics and global trends into a human one.  On paper, it would be easy to write off Greta’s words as another opinion among many. But as well as physical characteristics, our voices communicate our emotions. Thunberg’s terse and sombre monotone makes tangible the emotional significance of the deepening crisis facing her generation. In embodying the issue of climate breakdown, Thunberg’s voice also makes it personal. When she speaks, we are reminded that she is one individual – and that her actions alone inspired hundreds of thousands to join her. As the title of her recent collection of speeches says, No One Is Too Small to Make a Difference. Thunberg and her followers argue for systems change, but they do so as a chorus of individual voices. The quarter-million strong unified chant of Thunberg’s name at New York’s climate strikes reminds us that when individuals are empowered and brought together, they can each play an important part in tackling climate and ecological breakdown. The voice is not just a vehicle for language. The unique sounds of every human voice tell their own story alongside the words they carry. For Thunberg, this is the story of a generation let down and determined to effect change – whether leaders like it or not. As the movement she started continues to gain momentum, this message will underpin everything she and her followers say. Whether people are listening is another story.

Share this...FacebookTwitterNot only last winter was a brutal one for the USA, which saw the Great Lakes freeze over, this year is also turning out to be an epic one as record cold temperatures continue their unrelenting grip across the nation and massive snowfalls bury large regions across the east.
The UPI’s Fred Lambert recently wrote the bitter cold extends all the way to Siberia and had killed dozens across the US. Lambert writes:
According to the Weather Channel, the cold air mass now seizing the country stretches as far west as Russia, moving down through Canada and into the United States in what some meteorologists call the “Siberian Express.”
New all time records
The UK’s Mail online here reports that New York City’s 1°F reading set yesterday broke it’s 65-year old all-time cold record temperature. In Minnesota the mercury plummeted to -41°F. The Mail continues:
The temperature in Boston is below freezing, as the city is set to break the record of 16 days below 32F set in 1961.
In Florida, strawberry and orange crops have frozen over because of the harsh winter weather.”
The online English daily presents a spectacular series of winter photos. Even Niagara Falls has frozen over!
Unexpected freeze
As of Wednesday, over 85% of the Great Lakes was frozen over with experts predicting 100% ice cover in perhaps just a matter of a few more days. The USA Today here quotes George Leshkevich of the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory:
Nobody expected 2014 to be as bad as it was, almost record breaking for ice cover and this year it’s the same thing with these very cold temperatures.”

“Historical ice cover record”
This morning mlive.com here shows images of Lake Huron, which it writes: “Lake Huron is almost entirely covered in ice. It is only 2.7 percent away from its historical ice-cover record.”
All this in the “6th warmest winter”?
Strangely, despite all the record freezing, the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) claims that it has been the sixth-warmest winter on record. NCDC officials may want to go back and check their thermometers, as these claims are looking a lot like “padded room” quality.
If this cold and ice are warming, then ISIS is peace.

An estimated one million people took to Chile streets protesting about who knows what, much like France’s yellow vests and Hong Kong’s student uprisings, ongoing displays of dissatisfaction. Around the world, instigators and leaders of social change are invisible, freely muddying the waters with their anonymity and hidden agendas. 



“As a Chilean TV reporter attempted to interview protesters heading towards a demonstration in Santiago on Wednesday, one young girl elbowed him and shouted directly into the camera: “Turn off your televisions, the media lie! Get your information from social media!”



Yes, our media propped up by the national purse will tell us what they are told to, but at least the half-awake are aware of their bias and know that social media is not always transparent either. 



“What started as a complaint about a rise in metro fares has **ballooned into a multifarious protest over a host of grievances**. 



“One protester might be banging their pots because of pensions, another because of student debt, and yet another because they just can’t take it any more,” says Robert Funk, a political scientist at the University of Chile. 



“ **We each have real complaints. If you target the message correctly, you can gather all those complaints into one cause or movement.”**



Given that the demands of the protesters are diffuse and often symbolic makes it hard for the government of President Sebastián Piñera — which has offered some concessions — to provide solutions. Worse still, it is not even clear who they need to negotiate with.”



And therein lies the problem, opportunists perverting genuine grievances for political gain and democracy is powerless to stop them. Addressing collective issues is a real problem.



“A single spark can start a prairie fire,” observed Mao Zedong in 1930, as he tried to convince his followers that revolution was possible in China. Almost a century later, Mao’s observation comes to mind as little sparks set off mass demonstrations across the world. 



In Lebanon, the trigger for protests was a tax on WhatsApp messages. In Chile it was a rise in metro fares. 



In France, the gilets jaunes protests that began last year were set off by a rise in petrol taxes. 



Elsewhere, the roots of popular revolt are more clearly political. In Hong Kong, it was an attempt to allow extradition of criminal suspects to China. 



In Algeria, where mass protests have been going on for most of the year, it was an announcement that Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the ailing president, intended to run for a fifth term. 



Be formless, shapeless, like water” has been a rallying cry of almost five months of protests that have rocked Hong Kong. 



The slogan, originally coined by the city’s most famous son and kung-fu movie star Bruce Lee, embodies the nimble and creative strategies of protesters who have no leader and **mostly mobilise through social media**.”



How does a government fight insidious revolt? Where it is available, for example in Chile, the government uses military rule. 



“The soldier was about 40m away. He looked at me and fired,” said Christopher Madrid, pointing to the patch above his right eye. “I swung away and the bullet grazed [my forehead] and came out, left a scar of four or five centimetres.” 



Madrid, a 25-year-old student, [was shot last Monday by Chilean army](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/22/santiago-protesters-pinera-chile) troops as he marched in a street protest near the Catholic University in central Santiago.”



Here, the government simply wants to control social media and shut down free speech. Our tiny population makes us, on the one hand, more aware of interlopers, but, on the other, much more vulnerable to concerted attack by either an errant government or foreign influences.



Question the benefits of multiculturalism or man-made climate change and you will become a pariah. Government employees can kiss goodbye to upward mobility by refusing to embrace Te Reo. Conform to social engineering or risk alienation is our new norm.



The _Weekend Australian_ reported on feminists claiming colonisation is to blame for Australia’s high rate of indigenous domestic violence, which is the same argument used here regarding the high rate of Maori domestic violence. Our inability to address domestic violence is compounded by feminists on both sides of the Tasman who argue the solution is found in addressing gender equality. 



Rita Panapa on The Outsiders, Sky News, said about domestic violence “…it’s an important issue and people are using it to push their political barrows.” The loud feminist voice influences politicians to introduce ineffectual legislation such as the “Respectful Relationships” programme taught in Australian schools. But a recent study out of Australia confirms what we already know, that domestic violence is rooted in alcohol abuse and poverty. 



“A major study of domestic violence shows it is significantly linked to alcohol and poverty, **contradicting government policy focusing on gender equality** as the key to eradicating the problem, **leading researchers say.**



The Australian Institute of Criminology study collected data from 39 previous research reports on domestic violence and found a third of offenders had been drinking or were drunk, and alcohol significantly increased the severity of violence. 



The study also concluded violence was concentrated among a relatively small group of repeat offenders, and in more disadvantaged areas.”



Greenpeace had no trouble with sleepy NZ minds all too happy to save the endangered Maui dolphin and embrace a clean green NZ by planting forests and ending oil and mineral extraction – up until the farming backbone of the country complained about the economic downside and the high cost of fuel put pressure on everybody’s pay packet. 



It seems people will tolerate social engineering only insofar as their quality of life remains intact. When personal financial security is under threat by ill-conceived policy driven by ridiculous agendas, people start paying attention. Dreamers and idealists are outnumbered by realists, which is exactly as it should be.

"The UK’s governing Conservative Party has announced a new package of climate policies, including £220m for research into nuclear fusion reactors to provide clean energy “by 2040”. Although additional funding is welcome news to fusion researchers like me, it isn’t an effective response to climate change. It’s easy to see why such a pledge is appealing though. Nuclear fusion is the process that powers stars like our sun. Unlike current nuclear power plants – which split atoms in a process called fission – nuclear fusion binds atomic nuclei together. This releases much more energy than fission and produces no high-level nuclear waste. A fusion reactor would also produce zero carbon emissions and wouldn’t run the risk of a nuclear meltdown. Fusion could produce energy regardless of wind conditions or daylight hours, and wouldn’t require enriched uranium, which can be repurposed for nuclear weapons. As good as this all sounds, nuclear fusion is unlikely to play a major role in fighting climate change. To understand why, we need only look at the current state of fusion research. For decades, the performance of fusion devices has been improving – the capacity of scientists to confine hot hydrogen plasma has improved by a factor of 10,000. This plasma has to be over 100,000,000°C in order for the hydrogen nuclei to fuse and generate energy. The next big step is ITER, a huge project involving 35 nations, under construction in the south of France. ITER’s purpose is to test our ability to confine plasma for long enough and at a high enough density and temperature. Its goal is to be the first fusion device to produce more energy from the plasma than is put into it. But ITER isn’t a power station, it’s an experiment. The plan is to build a demonstration fusion power plant – called “DEMO” – after ITER shows it’s possible for the plasma to generate a net gain in energy. But ITER isn’t likely to reach this goal until 2035. The EU fusion roadmap assumes DEMO comes some time afterwards, likely around 2050 or later. The Tory promise of 2040 is extremely optimistic. A DEMO power plant needs to solve several problems which ITER won’t address. ITER’s power is produced in the form of neutrons which hit the reactor’s internal walls, but DEMO needs to actually turn that power into electricity. One of the biggest challenges is that a fusion reactor has to generate some of its own fuel. Two types of hydrogen are needed – deuterium, which is abundant in seawater, and tritium, which is rare on Earth because it decays into helium with a half-life of only 12 years. DEMO will need to combine the neutrons from the plasma with lithium to produce new tritium fuel, in a process called “tritium breeding”.  Unfortunately, prototypes of this crucial technology can’t even be tested until ITER starts producing copious high-energy neutrons, in 2035. The UK has a solid research plan working towards solving all of these problems, but there isn’t much that can be done to accelerate this timeline. In 2018, the IPCC released their 1.5°C report, which explained that the world must reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in order to limit future warming to 1.5°C. It’s unlikely that commercial fusion power plants will exist in time for that, and even once a first-of-its-kind DEMO power plant is operational, hundreds would still need to be built to seriously dent global emissions. None of this sits well with the 2040 date the Conservatives have promised. Even if a new green energy technology like fusion is realised before 2050, that’s far too late for the 1.5°C target anyway. “Net-zero by 2050” assumes that emissions have been constantly decreasing from now until 2050. As it’s the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that sets the level of eventual global warming, it’s cumulative emissions that matter. Even if we could snap our fingers on December 31, 2049 and replace all fossil fuel plants, the world would have already emitted twice as much carbon as the budget allows. Sound climate policy involves cutting emissions as soon as possible, and any further delay makes the task even harder. As with any research, nuclear fusion might not work. Despite the best efforts of researchers, it’s still possible that there’s an unforeseen roadblock. But the climate won’t wait for us if we trip up. Any convincing climate policy requires huge investments across many sectors, from domestic heating to road transport to agriculture. Even a complete decarbonisation of the electricity grid is only one part of the solution. The Committee on Climate Change’s net-zero report laid this all out starkly for policymakers – only mentioning nuclear fusion once in 227 pages. The idea of a single panacea is simplistic fantasy. The likely role for fusion would be as an energy source in a post-carbon society. It’s well worth funding it for that reason alone, and it’s possible that an unexpected breakthrough will ensure it can reduce emissions after all. In fact, research into all sorts of new technologies could help make reducing emissions easier, such as industrial carbon capture and storage. The allure of fusion makes it a good distraction from the failures of the current government’s science and climate policy. The Committee on Climate Change has set 25 targets that need to be met to ensure the UK is a net-zero society by 2050. The government is currently only on track to meet one of them.  This funding is also of little consolation to laboratories who are worried about the impact of Brexit on UK science, and their international staff who rely on freedom of movement. In fact, the government has yet to commit to paying to participate in the EU DEMO programme in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Climate policy should prioritise deploying proven technologies immediately, without relying on speculative solutions. Stopping climate change is too important to leave to the last minute.

A couple of days ago, I was sent this satirical cartoon totally unsolicited by SFO Bay Area artist Tim Sheppard who said he was troubled by the free speech issues surrounding the Mann-Steyn lawsuit. He sends it with a disclaimer:
DISCLAIMER:  The following editorial cartoon contains satire, parody, exaggeration and uncensored imagery of balding public figures projected to be completely hairless about the north polar region by the year 2020.
It is not peer reviewed.  It makes no claims to absolute undeniable, settled truth, while it does depict a very plausible scenario wherein  catastrophic warming might cause pants to combust and hockey sticks to break spontaneously.
No actual polar bears were harmed in the production of this cartoon.
Free speech is the issue.  The answer to discomforting free speech is even more free speech.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) has a report here analyzing the 2014 wind energy output of the German state of Baden Wurttemberg (BW), home of the world famous Black Forest, which in turn is home to the cuckoo clock.
Well, it turns out that not only the clocks in BW have gone cuckoo, but so has its energy policy!
“Frightening” results
A few years ago the traditionally conservative South German state elected a green Prime Minister, who vowed to shut down the state’s nuclear power plants and to install wind energy in its place. BW is not exactly the best place for wind power. EIKE writes that the Gegenwind- Straubenhardt wind power protest group compared actual wind energy production to the expected figures. The results, EIKE writes, are “frightening”.
By the end of 2014 BW had 397 wind turbines with 678 MW of total installed rated capacity. The yield and result, EIKE writes:
All wind turbines in Baden Wurttemberg produced a total of 699,564 MWh of power. That corresponds to an annual mean wind power feed-in of 79.9 MW or 11.8% of the available annual mean of 676.9 MW.”
Only 11.8%!
The following chart shows the output of BW’s wind turbines for each month:

Figure 1: Wind power feed-in (red) and installed rated capacity (green) over the year 2014. Source: TransnetBW
Readers can see the multiple times wind power went almost completely AWOL, like early December, early August, or the end of March through the early part of April. Pathetic.
The breakdown of the operating hours of wind power output shows just how pathetic wind energy really is.
* 339.75 hours (= 14.2 days = 3.9%) saw zero wind (0 MW), no power was generated at all!
* 1403.50 hours (= 58.5 days = 16.0%) power output was under 7 MW (1% of rated capacity).
* 3614 hours (= 5 months = 41.3%) power output was under 5% of rated capacity
* 5308 hours (= 7.4 months = 60.6%) wind power was below 10% of rated capacity.
Here we see that conventional power plants always need to be on standby, and most of the time they have to be filling in for the often AWOL wind turbines.
The industrialization of Germany’s Black Forest region with ugly skyscraper-dimensioned wind turbines is a hell of a price to pay for so little in return.

"Countries across the globe are trying to wind down coal production. While this will help in the battle against climate change, those communities that have specialised in coal mining may see their local job market decline or be eliminated entirely. Most of these places have mined coal for many generations. Given long-standing traditions, such communities will inevitably resist decarbonisation unless they are given appropriate reassurances regarding their economic and social survival. We recently researched what did – and didn’t – work in coal regions of Canada, Australia and Germany. Our aim was to identify which policies have been most successful in halting the production of coal without placing the economic burden on coal workers and communities. Our results are now published in the journal Energy Policy. Workers in extractive industries like mining or oil are often presented as the public face of opposition to environmental protection. However, research has shown that workers in “dirty” industries do tend to support environmentally friendly policies once their immediate interests are not negatively affected.  Furthermore, there is clear evidence that environmental protection and transitioning to the low-carbon economy has the potential to create employment just as much as it can cause unemployment.  The European Trade Union Institute has developed various indicators of a “just transition” away from coal – dialogue, retraining, and so on. In our paper, we used these indicators to identify what worked in our three case study areas. We found that active dialogue with communities is key. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, policy is jointly formulated by employees and employers, giving workers a voice which is largely equal to that of industrialists. The proportion of employees on supervisory boards is determined by the number of employees, which means there is one-third employee representation if there are more than 500 employees and parity on the supervisory board if there are more than 2,000 employees. This has meant coal mining has been gradually reduced and now nearly eliminated without major social or political upheaval.  In contrast, Hazelwood coal power station and adjoining mine in Victoria, Australia were closed with minimal consultation with unions or government, and after just five months notice.  Where dialogue does occur, it must be genuine and followed by action. In coal villages in Alberta, Canada, such as Forestburg or Wabamun, the industry did attempt to talk to workers and local officials but the structure of the talks was poorly defined, resulting in workers not trusting the decarbonisation processes. We identified re-employment in “clean” industries as a way to maintain livelihoods. The German approach to re-employment has seen North-Rhine Westphalia reinvent itself as a leader in new energy technologies. Central to this has been a bottom-up approach involving co-operation between workers, communities, employers and government.  In Victoria, the dominance of the coal industry has hindered the transition towards a lower-carbon economy. However, the establishment of the Earthworker Cooperative has provided a platform for various affected groups to establish sustainable enterprises such as Australia’s first worker-owned factory, making renewable energy appliances and components. This demonstrates how local communities can create employment and maintain profits within their area without relying on coal.  In Alberta, a number of production facilities are simply shifting from coal to gas. While this shift creates jobs outside the coal sector, it does little to secure employment overall, since natural gas extraction and production requires fewer workers than coal. For example, energy company TransAlta is converting its coal-fired Sundance power plant in Wabamun to natural gas, which means the overall workforce will be cut in half when the layoffs are complete. Re-training allows workers to develop the necessary skills to work outside of the coal sector. In North Rhine-Westphalia, training programmes have targeted a number of different sectors including engineering, trades, business and technology. The industrial heartland of the Ruhr area – once the centre of Germany’s coal industry – has six new universities, 15 colleges and 60 research facilities since 1961. This Strukturwandel, or structural change, has developed a highly skilled workforce and demonstrates the potential for economic growth and diversification beyond coal. Education and training has been made more accessible through subsidised retraining – in Alberta, through the Coal and Electricity Transition Tuition Voucher, and in Victoria through the Training Guarantee. This ensures that retraining does not place an additional burden on those facing redundancy. Investing in infrastructure is a further means by which to secure sustainable transitions for workers and their families. In North Rhine-Westphalia and Victoria, government funding has primarily focused on roads and rail alongside investment in community infrastructure such as sports and recreational facilities. This ensures that former mining areas do not remain synonymous with coal production, pollution and socio-economic problems, and makes them a more attractive place for other industries to invest. Moving away from fossil fuels such as coal is central to achieving emissions targets. This doesn’t have to create huge social unrest. With the goodwill of policymakers and through measures such as those we have identified, decarbonisation strategies can be developed and implemented while maintaining livelihoods for those directly affected.

Phil Goff has tried to appease everyone by expanding the size of the Auckland Council trough. Now all can have a swill, even his opponents:



Phil Goff appears to be trying to keep even his political opponents onside, finding a role for all 20 councillors in a widened committee structure for [his second term](http://Fourth Auckland Council sworn in with climate change focus).



However, there were already signs of ripples as Goff unveiled the divvying-up on Monday of political jobs in front of media and most of his [freshly-elected council](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/116623934/auckland-council-election-big-special-vote-count-leaves-seat-changes-possible).



Goff’s creation of 32 positions of responsibility could either be a masterstroke of political patronage, or turn out to be a broth spoiled by having too many cooks.



There are no surprises with the big jobs.



Bill Cashmore remains deputy mayor, Chris Darby stays as the chair of Planning, and Richard Hills moves up from deputy, to chair the Environment and Climate Change committee, a spot vacated by the retiring Penny Hulse.



Desley Simpson moves up from deputy chair of Finance and Performance, to replace Ross Clow who missed re-election.



The sad thing about this is that one of the biggests troughers, Bill Cashmore, was elected unopposed. But Goff has been even sneakier than usual:



Six new liaison roles have been created, putting councillors at the board table of the [five Council-Controlled-Organisations](https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/112479005/phil-goffs-first-election-policy-review-auckland-council-agencies) (CCOs), **but they won’t have voting rights** and will channel information between the agencies and the council.



Darby and Cashmore will work with Auckland Transport’s board, Linda Cooper with Watercare, John Watson with ATEED, Richard Hills with Regional Facilities Auckland, and Darby with Panuku Development.



Good grief, they are **powerless, message deliverers**. All the appearance of power but in actual fact, none.



The “jobs for all” approach knew no boundaries, even Rodney ward councillor Greg Sayers – who voted against almost everything in the past term, and fashioned himself as a leading Goff opponent – accepted the chairing role on the Strategic Procurement committee.



Veteran councillor Christine Fletcher who teamed-up with Goff’s main mayoral challenger John Tamihere during the election campaign and was scathing of the mayor’s performance, will line up as Goff’s deputy on the Appointments and Performance Review committee, and take on the portfolio lead role for Parks and Open Space – a personal passion.



On paper, Goff’s approach to make this council “as inclusive as I can make it” looks good, but the managing of 20 occasionally difficult relationships will remain one of his major challenges this term.



Room at the trough for all.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German media are reporting on findings of a study appearing in Nature coming from the Jochen Marotzke of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) in Hamburg and Piers Forster of University of Leeds, who both insist the climate models continue to be correct –  despite having been wrong for 18 years.
Warming not showing up
The DPA, via Die Welt here, has an article titled: “Why the crass global warming is not showing up” and writes:
The earth’s temperature over the past 15 years has not warmed as much as the climate models projected. In the opinion of scientists this not due to poor climate modeling, but rather because of ‘random climate fluctuations’. “
Modelers blame “spontaneous climate variability”
The MPI-M press release claims there is “no evidence for systematic model error” and blames “spontaneous climate variability” arising from “chaotic processes in the climate system” for the growing divergence between observations and simulations since the conception of the climate models.
The MPI-M press release obviously concedes the climate models do not understand the short and mid-term natural factors at play in climate, saying that the 1998 to 2012 period “witnessed some extreme regional climate trends, such as a strong cooling in central Siberia during winter and an unparalleled strengthening of the trade winds in the Pacific causing cold ocean water to reach the surface. Such random extreme events are very rare and are hard to reproduce with models.”
Modelers have struck out on short and mid-term reliability
Clearly the modelers are rapidly abandoning any earlier claims made of short-term and mid-term model reliability, where they have plainly struck out, and are now left asking us to believe in their long-term reliability.
For years skeptics have warned alarmist scientists that they were making grave mistakes in ignoring the climate’s natural cyclic behavior and that the generally chaotic climate system was not predictable. Predictably, they scoffed and insisted that their models were “tweaked”, “fine-tuned” and as good as gold. But it turns out they have not been okay since the very start, and now the climate scientists are insisting the models are okay so long as you ignore all the short and mid-term factors that make them not okay.
The DPA German news agency writes:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";

google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";

google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




In a first step the scientists compared the 114 simulations with the actual observations. The question was whether the simulations are too sensitive and certain factors too heavily weighted and as a result forecast too much warming. If that were the case, then the most sensitive models would have to forecast the most warming, explains Marotzke. That is not at all the case. Foremost they did not in principle react too sensitively to an increase in atmospheric CO2. Moreso it was chaos and random events in weather that make the work of climate scientists difficult.”
And that difficulty has been a huge thorn in the models’ side for about 17 years now. It’s panic time.
Variablilty? Or an inconvenient climate cycle?
The MPI-M press release insists that 15 years are too short because here “the differences between simulated and observed trends are dominated by spontaneous climate variability and that the sensitivity of climate in the models plays no role.”
The real question that needs to be asked is: Have the models been wrong for 15 years really because of weird random weather events, which is what the MPI-M seems to be hoping, or are these “random events” part of a powerful climate-driving, natural cycle that the warmist scientists are refusing to acknowledge?
How much longer before they throw in the towel?
Unfortunately the MPI-M failed to tell us how much longer the current divergence can continue on before their latest explanation falls apart. Kevin Trenberth told us 17 years was already enough to make the call. The MPI-M charts suggest it’s around 20 years. The MPI-M paper may buy the warmists a little bit more time, but convincing it is not.
Yet, MPM-M director Marotzke stubbornly continues his desperate cling to the models, and is quoted by the DPA:
Over the long term we can rely on the models,’ says Marotzke. ‘And they tell us that the warming is coming at us.'”
We’ll be watching, and I suspect waiting…and waiting…and waiting.

"Residents of Middlesbrough in north-east England will be the first in the UK to legally ride electric scooters on the open road when the law changes on Saturday, as the government struggles to prevent a recovery from coronavirus based on cars. Though e-scooters have been whizzing illegally around many UK cities for the past few years, the pandemic has prompted the government to speed up plans to pilot public rental schemes. The Department for Transport said the Tees Valley would be the first to test what the region’s mayor, Ben Houchen, praised as “a clean energy, socially distant mode of transport”. An initial 100 scooters are set to appear in Middlesbrough later this month in a partnership with a new UK-based operator, Ginger, rolling out across Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool. Allowed to go no faster than 15.5mph, the scooters can be ridden on the road or in bike lanes but not on the pavement. Helmets are recommended but not compulsory. It is likely to cost about £1 to unlock a scooter using an app, with riders charged between 15p and 25p per minute extra per ride. Users will need a full or provisional car, motorcycle or moped licence to take part in the trials, and must be 16 or over. Though e-scooters are already available to buy online and in many bike shops, only rented bikes will be legal under the law that applies in England, Scotland and Wales. How this distinction will be policed is not yet clear, admits Portsmouth councillor Lynne Stagg, who is part of a committee that has agreed to introduce a rental scheme across the Solent region of Hampshire, Portsmouth, Southampton and the Isle of Wight this summer. “I’m all for e-scooters as long as they are legal. We have been liaising with the police over how to crack down on the illegal ones. I’ve seen people already riding like absolute lunatics,” she said. She hopes e-scooters can be part of a green economic recovery, improving air quality and reducing congestion. “The average number of cars per household in Portsmouth is 1.6. My hope is that e-scooters will encourage households to get rid of their second car,” she said. Rental companies already operating in mainland Europe are competing with startups such as Ginger in a race to woo local authorities, insisting they will bear the costs – and risks – of pilot schemes. “We’ve already been contacted by 20, perhaps 25 different firms,” said Stagg. Despite a few high-profile accidents – last year the Youtuber and TV presenter Emily Hartridge died riding an e-scooter in London – research from the International Transport Federation found that a trip by car or by motorcycle in a dense urban area is much more likely to result in a death than a trip by a e-scooter. Councils can stipulate how their pilot schemes operate. In Portsmouth and the Tees Valley, users will be fined for riding outside of the operation zone and have to dock their bikes in designated parking spaces. Other areas may take a more relaxed approach, allowing riders to park up wherever they like. Some may consider that naive, given the experience of the first generation of “dockless” bike hire schemes, such as Mobike, much of whose fleet was vandalised or dumped in canals after launching in Manchester in 2017. The operators insist they have learned lessons from Mobike’s woes. “Overall, our loss rate is about 0.5% and we are active now in 65 cities in nine countries,” said Roger Hassan, the chief operating officer of Tier, a German company that hopes to gain a foothold in the UK to add to its 45,000-strong fleet. “We’ve learned from the Mobike wave of craziness.” Tier scooters weigh 27kg, making it more difficult – but not impossible – to throw in a canal. Most rental models include GPS tracking and software that allow operators to designate no-go zones. In London, the US-owned operator Bird has run a rental scheme in the privately owned Olympic Park since November 2018. According to spokesman Harry Porter, Bird can programme the scooters to drop their speed in certain areas. “So when they approach a playground, for example, the maximum speed drops to 5mph until you’ve gone 50 yards beyond it,” said Porter. Only one scooter has gone missing in 18 months, he insisted: “If we see that a scooter has left the zone we just turn the motor off so that it is no fun to ride and all someone has cluttering up their hallway is a useless, massive paperweight.” Many conflicts lie ahead, not least with blind people, who argue they are most likely to be mowed down by e-scooters. “If there is strong uptake – and looking elsewhere in the world where they are being used it’s likely there will be – then they will add to the case for bike lanes which would be good,” said Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cyclist turned Greater Manchester walking and cycling commissioner. “Longer term they may also see people progress to bikes for greater speed, range and health so the potential to be a positive travel disruptor is high. However, there are a lot of hurdles that need to be addressed, such as the potential conflict with pedestrians and the need for smooth roads to stay safe, so I’ll be fascinated to see how the trial goes.” Werneth Low is one of the steepest hills in Greater Manchester, offering spectacular views towards the city and Peak District but really testing the thighs of even the fittest cyclists. I decided to see whether an e-scooter could cope with the 13% gradient, borrowing the world’s bestselling e-scooter – the Xiaomi M365 pro (£569.99) – from Pure Electric. The UK government says e-scooters can have motors with a maximum continuous power rating of 500W. The Xiaomi’s is 300W and a fully charged battery will propel you up to 28 miles at a maximum speed of 15mph. To get going, you have to do a few manual scoots and then press a little lever on the handlebars before – whoosh! – you’re off. Even just over 12mph feels naughtily fast, so I keep my left hand permanently hovering over the brake as I whizz through Stockport’s suburbia. In my spare time I campaign to get more people walking and cycling where I live. The hills have always been a stumbling block to the cause but e-bikes and scooters feel like a realistic alternative to car commuting for those normal people who don’t perspire for fun. The Xiaomi survives the ascent of Werneth Low, chivvied along with a few human scoots. Going downhill is the hairy part, particularly when I hit an enormous pothole. My trip is, strictly speaking, illegal. From Saturday, only rented e-scooters will be allowed on the roads. But Pure Electric is hoping to offer long-term loans to customers to keep the government happy. I’m certainly smiling after my illicit test drive – and am not even vaguely sweaty for once."
"WASHINGTON  —   Congress’s rush to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, once seemingly unstoppable, is flagging badly as Republicans struggle to come up with a replacement and a key senator has declared that the effort is more a repair job than a demolition. “It is more accurate to say ‘repair Obamacare,’” Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said this week. “We can repair the individual market, and that is a good place to start. ” The struggles and false starts have injected more uncertainty into insurance markets that thrive on stability. An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone. The powerful retirees’ lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case: unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation, even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers. Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act’s market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions: Will they support the existing public marketplaces, encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers, or not? “We need some certainty around the rules,” said Dr. J. Mario Molina, chief executive of Molina Healthcare, which has been a stalwart in the Affordable Care Act market and is making money under the system. “We have a few months, but we don’t have a lot of time,” he said. With the official end on Tuesday of what was supposed to be its final open enrollment season, the Affordable Care Act is looking more resilient than it seemed just a month ago. It will still be several days before final enrollment figures are released, and although a surge of   signups failed to have materialize amid talk of repeal, early indications did not point to a collapse. At their annual retreat last week, in Philadelphia, several congressional Republicans edged away from their powerful promise to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act. It would, they said, be more accurate to say they intend to fix a law that they blame for the cancellation of many insurance policies, soaring premiums and a shrinking choice of health plans in many states. Many Republicans say their resolve to dismantle the law, a central element of President Barack Obama’s legacy, is undiminished. “We are looking to repeal this law, just like we told the voters we were going to do, just like we promised them we would do,” said Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio and a leader of the House’s most conservative wing. “After all, there was an election where that was one of the most important issues. ” But after waging and winning many elections with a promise to kill it, Republicans still have no agreement on how to replace it. They will, they say, pursue a piecemeal approach because they have no desire to supplant the giant 2010 health law with a single comprehensive Republican plan cooked up in Washington. When Congress convened this year, Republicans immediately introduced a budget resolution clearing the way for legislation to gut the health law, with strong support from Mr. Trump, who took office 17 days later. But Mr. Trump’s rocky start has slowed the momentum, depleting his political capital and dimming prospects for bipartisan cooperation. In addition, many senators are preoccupied with fights over the confirmation of Mr. Trump’s nominees to the Supreme Court and top jobs in his administration. What was once considered Congress’s Job No. 1 is being eclipsed for some lawmakers by more immediate matters. Insurers say Republicans’ mixed messages and slowing pace could send premiums soaring next year while making the market much less stable. The deadline to file rates for 2018 is this spring, and insurers say they need time to decide what kinds of plans to offer and to set prices. “We need stability and predictability,” said Marilyn B. Tavenner, the chief executive of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobby for the industry. Unless Congress continues   subsidies, to reduce    costs for   people, and a reinsurance program, to help pay large claims, she said, more insurers will pull out of the market. Insurers are also concerned about signs that the Trump administration may not enforce the   individual mandate, which requires people to have insurance or face a tax penalty. The penalty, or some way to encourage more participation, is seen as central to having enough young and healthy people sign up to keep premiums low. “It’s very important to indicate how they are going to stabilize the market,” said Karen M. Ignagni, the chief executive of EmblemHealth, who was instrumental in the development of the current law. At the very least, analysts say the uncertainty for insurers could lead to much higher rates. “2018 is a wild card,” said Deep Banerjee, who follows insurers for Standard  Poor’s. Many insurers could simply end up walking away, warned Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University who recently surveyed insurers about what they might do. “At a certain point, you can’t price high enough to account for that uncertainty,” she said. The end game is perhaps predictable. In the Senate, Republicans will need help from Democrats to replace the health law because they hold 52 seats but will need 60 votes. Several Republican senators, like Susan Collins of Maine and Bob Corker of Tennessee, say they will not vote to repeal the law unless they have a clear picture of what will replace it. And Democrats will not support any replacement unless Republicans scrap the idea of an outright repeal, which conservatives have been demanding for years. “We can’t repair the roof while Republicans and the president are burning the house down,” said Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington. Republicans have many ideas about how to shore up insurance markets and lower costs. But it is highly unlikely that any of their proposals would be found by the Congressional Budget Office to insure as many people as the Affordable Care Act. Downbeat assessments from the budget office have doomed many proposals in the past, including the health care plan devised by Bill and Hillary Clinton in 1993. Mr. Trump chose Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, to be his secretary of health and human services, with the expectation that he would work closely with Republicans in Congress on the details of a replacement plan. Democrats have delayed his confirmation, and that in turn has delayed Republican efforts to devise an alternative to the health care law they detest. Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee voted on Wednesday to recommend confirmation of Mr. Price, overriding objections by Democrats, who boycotted the proceedings. All of that turmoil in Washington has left insurers scrambling. “While the direction in Washington has been positive, we still need certainty about   fixes in order to determine the extent of our participation,” Joseph R. Swedish, the chief executive of Anthem, one of the nation’s largest insurers and a major player in the market, told investors on Wednesday. Anthem said it expected to break even or make money selling individual coverage this year but said the market continued not to work as well as it could. “We have weighed in considerably, and continue to do so, with all the leadership in Congress,” Mr. Swedish said."

We have two new entries to the long (and growing) list of papers appearing the in recent scientific literature that argue that the earth’s climate sensitivity—the ultimate rise in the earth’s average surface temperature from a doubling of the atmospheric carbon dioxide content—is close to 2°C, or near the low end of the range of possible values presented by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  With a low-end warming comes low-end impacts and an overall lack of urgency for federal rules and regulations (such as those outlined in the President’s Climate Action Plan) to limit carbon dioxide emissions and limit our energy choices.

The first is the result of a research effort conducted by Craig Loehle and published in the journal Ecological Modelling. The paper is a pretty straightforward determination of the climate sensitivity.  Loehle first uses a model of natural modulations to remove the influence of natural variability (such as solar activity and ocean circulation cycles) from the observed temperature history since 1850. The linear trend in the post-1950 residuals from Loehle’s natural variability model was then assumed to be largely the result, in net, of human carbon dioxide emissions.  By dividing the total temperature change (as indicated by the best-fit linear trend) by the observed rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide content, and then applying that relationship to a doubling of the carbon dioxide content, Loehle arrives at an estimate of the earth’s transient climate sensitivity—transient, in the sense that at the time of CO2 doubling, the earth has yet to reach a state of equilibrium and some warming is still to come.
Loehle estimated the equilibrium climate sensitivity from his transient calculation based on the average transient:equilibrium ratio projected by the collection of climate models used in the IPCC’s most recent Assessment Report. In doing so, he arrived at an equilibrium climate sensitivity estimate of 1.99°C with a 95% confidence range of it being between 1.75°C and 2.23°C.
Compare Loehle’s estimate to the IPCC’s latest assessment of the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity which assigns a 66 percent or greater likelihood that it lies somewhere in the range from 1.5°C to 4.5°C. Loehle’s determination is more precise and decidedly towards the low end of the range.
The second entry to our list of low climate sensitivity estimates comes from  Roy Spencer and William Braswell and published in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Atmospheric Sciences. Spencer and Braswell used a very simple climate model to simulate the global temperature variations averaged over the top 2000 meters of the global ocean during the period 1955-2011. They first ran the simulation using only volcanic and anthropogenic influences on the climate. They ran the simulation again adding a simple take on the natural variability contributed by the El Niño/La Niña process. And they ran the simulation a final time adding in a more complex situation involving a feedback from El Niño/La Niña onto natural cloud characteristics. They then compared their model results with the set of real-world observations.
What the found, was the that the complex situation involving El Niño/La Niña feedbacks onto cloud properties produced the best match to the observations.  And this situation also produced the lowest estimate for the earth’s climate sensitivity to carbon dioxide emissions—a value of 1.3°C.
Spencer and Braswell freely admit that using their simple model is just the first step in a complicated diagnosis, but also point out that the results from simple models provide insight that should help guide the development of more complex models, and ultimately could help unravel some of the mystery as to why full climate models produce  high estimates of the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity, while estimates based in real-world observations are much lower.
Our Figure below helps to illustrate the discrepancy between climate model estimates and real-world estimates of the earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity. It shows Loehle’s determination as well as that of Spencer and Braswell along with 16 other estimates reported in the scientific literature, beginning in 2011. Also included in our Figure is both the IPCC’s latest assessment of the literature as well as the characteristics of the equilibrium climate sensitivity from the collection of climate models that the IPCC uses to base its impacts assessment.


Figure 1. Climate sensitivity estimates from new research beginning in 2011 (colored), compared with the assessed range given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the collection of climate models used in the IPCC AR5. The “likely” (greater than a 66% likelihood of occurrence)range in the IPCC Assessment is indicated by the gray bar. The arrows indicate the 5 to 95 percent confidence bounds for each estimate along with the best estimate (median of each probability density function; or the mean of multiple estimates; colored vertical line). Ring et al. (2012) present four estimates of the climate sensitivity and the red box encompasses those estimates. The right-hand side of the IPCC AR5 range is actually the 90% upper bound (the IPCC does not actually state the value for the upper 95 percent confidence bound of their estimate). Spencer and Braswell (2013) produce a single ECS value best-matched to ocean heat content observations and internal radiative forcing.

Quite obviously, the IPCC is rapidly losing is credibility.
As a result, the Obama Administration would do better to come to grips with this fact and stop deferring to the IPCC findings when trying to justify increasingly  burdensome  federal regulation of  carbon dioxide emissions, with the combined effects of manipulating markets and restricting energy choices.

Stockholm observatory weather station, source of the temperature record
Rebuttal to Åström et al. Attributing mortality from extreme temperatures to climate change in Stockholm, Sweden., published in Nature Climate Change by Paul C. “Chip” Knappenberger, Patrick J. Michaels, and Anthony Watts
Last fall, the press pounced on the results of a new study that found that global climate change was leading to an increasing frequency of heat waves and resulting in greater heat-related mortality. Finally a scientific study showing that global warming is killing us after all! See all you climate change optimists have been wrong all along, human-caused global warming is a threat to our health and welfare.
Not so fast.
Upon closer inspection, it turns out that the authors of that study—which examined heat-related mortality in Stockholm, Sweden—failed to include the impacts of adaptation in their analysis as well as the possibility that some of the temperature rise which has taken place in Stockholm is not from “global” climate change but rather local and regional processes not related to human greenhouse gas emissions.

What the researchers Daniel Oustin Åström and colleagues left out of their original analysis, we (Chip Knappenberger, Pat Michaels, and Anthony Watts) factored in. And when we did so, we arrived at the distinct possibility that global warming led to a reduction in the rate of heat-related mortality in Stockholm.
Our findings have just been published (paywalled) in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change as a Comment on the original Oustin Åström paper (which was published in the same journal).
We were immediately skeptical because the original Oustin Åström results run contrary to a solid body of scientific evidence (including our own) that shows that heat-related mortality and the population’s sensitivity to heat waves was been declining in major cities across America and Europe as people take adaptive measures to protect themselves from the rising heat.
Contrarily, Oudin Åström reported that as a result of an increase in the number of heat waves occurring in Stockholm, more people died from extreme heat during the latter portion of the 20th century than would have had the climate of Stockholm been similar to what it was in the early part of the 20th century—a time during which fewer heat waves were recorded. The implication was that global warming from increasing human greenhouse gas emissions was killing people from increased heat.
But the variability in the climate of Stockholm is a product of much more than human greenhouse gas emissions. Variations in the natural patterns of regional-scale atmospheric circulation, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), as well as local impacts associated with urbanization and environmental changes in the direct vicinity of the thermometer are reflected in the city’s temperature history, and the original Oudin Åström et al. publication did not take this into account. This effect is potentially significant as Stockholm is one of Europe’s fastest growing cities.
But regardless of the cause, rising temperatures spur adaptation. Expanded use of air conditioning, biophysical changes, behavior modification, and community awareness programs are all examples of actions which take place to make us better protected from the dangers associated with heat waves. Additionally, better medical practices, building practices, etc. have further reduced heat-related stress and mortality over the years.
The net result is that as result of the combination of all the adaptive measures that have taken place over the course of the 20th century in Stockholm, on average people currently die in heat waves at a rate four times less than they did during the beginning of the 20th century. The effect of adaptation overwhelms the effect of an increase in the number of heat waves.
In fact, it is not a stretch to say that much of the adaptation has likely occurred because of an increased frequency of heat waves. As heat waves become more common, the better adapted to them the population becomes.
Our analysis highlights one of the often overlooked intricacies of the human response to climate change—the fact that the response to a changing climate can actually improve public health and welfare.
Which, by the way, is a completely different view than the one taken by the current Administration.

============================================================
Further detail by Anthony:
It should be noted that Nature Climate Change, which tends to be a fast track journal, took months to publish our correspondence, going through a longer than normal review process for such a short correspondence, and only did so along with a reply from Åström et al. Despite this uphill slog, we persevered.
Personally, I think the response from Åström et al. is ludicrous, especially this part:
“Our data indicate that there is no adaptation to heat extremes on a decadal basis or to the number of heat extremes occurring each year. “
Basically what they are saying is the people of Stockholm are too stupid to use an air conditioner or electric fan when it gets hot, and are incapable of any adaptation.
The other part of their response:

Our method of comparing the climate during two 30-year periods is valid for any two periods.

Well no, not really, and it is this flaw in their method that was a central point of our paper.
Variations in the natural patterns of regional-scale atmospheric circulation, such as the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) as well as local impacts associated with urbanization and environmental changes in the direct vicinity of the thermometer are reflected in the city of Stockholm temperature history, and the original Åström et al. publication did not take this into account. By not looking at these factors, and by just taking the Stockholm temperature data at face value, assuming all of the heat extremes in it were “climate change” induced instead of being partially influenced by other effects, including the AMO and the city itself, allowed Åström et al. to become victims of their own confirmation bias.
For example, look at the GISTEMP record from Stockholm (which ends before 2000, not my fault). Note the 1900-1929 period.

Åström et al. compared two periods of Stockholm temperature data: 1900–1929 and 1980–2009, and used them as the basis for their entire paper. Here is their method from the abstract posted on the NIH website:
Methods: We collected daily temperature data for the period 1900-2009 and daily mortality data for the period 1980–2009 in Stockholm, Sweden. The relationship between extreme temperatures and all-cause mortality was investigated through time series modelling, adjusting for time trends. Attribution of mortality to climate change was calculated using the relative risks and baseline mortality during 1980-2009 and the number of excess extreme temperature events occurring in the last 30 years as compared to our baseline period 1900-1929. Results: Mortality from heat extremes doubled due to warming associated with climate change. The number of deaths attributable to climate change over the last 30 years due to excess heat extremes in Stockholm was estimated to be 323 (95% CI: 184, 465) compared with a reduction of 82 (95% CI: 43, 122) lives saved due to fewer cold extremes.
Only one problem, a big one, note that right after 1929 there was a big shift in the AMO data – what happens to the AMO in 1930 is essentially a “sea change”.

After 1930, the AMO was positive (warm phase) for over 30 years, went negative (cold phase) again around 1963-64, and stayed negative until a big uptick around 1998.
The AMO was primarily in its cold phase during the 1900–1929 period, and primarily in its warm phase during the 1980–2009 period — a difference likely to be responsible for some portion of the increase in extreme-heat events identified by Åström et al. and inappropriately attributed to global climate change. See Sutton and Dong 2012 for an explanation as to why the AMO affects the temperature record of Europe.
Then there were the changes/growth in the city itself, some movements and encroachments on the Stockholm observatory station, plus the fact that the mortality numbers they cited didn’t make sense when compared to other studies of trends in heat-related mortality across the United States and Europe which have reported declines in both total mortality and the sensitivity of urban populations to extreme heat,despite an increasing frequency of extreme-heat events.
Despite the long review, to the credit of Nature Climate Change, they recognized that we had a valid argument that mostly nullified the Åström et al. paper. Otherwise we’d never have gotten this published. Unfortunately, we can’t counter all the media hype from the original publication, but I hope readers will cite our rebuttal when appropriate.

2013 was a cool year in many ways. Most interestingly, the last year this split between highs and lows happened in the USA, in 1993, we had the eruption from Mt. Pinatubo the prior year which ejected so much aerosol into the atmosphere that it blocked sunlight and cooled the planet.

Source: http://www.woodfortrees.org/plot/hadcrut4gl/from:1978
This year, 2013, we have no similar large volcanic influence, and so the cause can’t be pinned on an specific aerosol event. It seems that natural variation played a bigger role this time. It also says much about Hansen’s “loaded climate dice”
This table from NCDC pretty well sums up the headline.


Source: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/records/
Note also the “Last Year to Date” line on the bottom. in 2013, we have less than one-third of the number of record highs as in 2012.

The most striking thing about the whole climate alarmism cult is just how thoroughly bourgeois it all is. Extinction Rebellion are a bunch of Etonian toffs playing dress-ups and inconveniencing working-class people. The “schools strikes” are awash with private school blazers. “Climate summits” are religious holidays for celebrities, a mix of pilgrimage and Club Med.



Even worse, these wealthy parasites relentlessly bleed the taxpayer to fund their millenarian fantasies and climate-religious indulgences. Solar panels are just one form of the middle-class welfare by which the [bougy](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bougy) cultists of Gaia bilk taxpayers. Electric vehicles are another.



EVs are strictly for the wealthy, costing as much or more than a petrol luxury car. They’d be even more hideously expensive if they weren’t subsidised to the hilt by taxpayers.



 **Taxpayers who have just about had enough.**



Electric vehicle drivers should be charged road-user costs, with 76 per cent of Australians calling on green-car owners to contribute to transport infrastructure, and ­almost one-in-two declaring it unfair they avoid paying fuel excise.



New polling obtained by The Australian reveals pushback against electric vehicle owners, with Australian motorists warning “there shouldn’t be one rule for them and another for us”.



But they’re middle-class **and** green. Of **course** , there’s one rule for them and another for we common oiks.



AAA managing director Michael Bradley said […]“Low emissions vehicle technologies are evolving rapidly and while no one wants the adoption of cleaner, safer cars stifled, Australia’s tax system needs to be updated if it is to be ready for the changes coming.



“The task in front of government is to fix a structural flaw in the federal budget by creating a national road access charge for low emission vehicles, which brings this growing fleet into the tax system without disincentivising uptake.”



[…]In February, the Electric ­Vehicle Council welcomed IA’s identification of the need to construct a national electric vehicle fast-charging network as a “high priority initiative for Australia”.



No, it’s a high-priority initiative for **them**. Let them pay for it. Just to show how outrageous the entitlement mentality of middle-class green sponges is, councils in Tasmania are installing free charging points for EV. Which is much the same as installing free petrol pumps for Audis and Beemers only.



“It’s their choice to get (an electric car) but they should pay too,” a respondent said.



Others said “when you think about it, it’s like tax avoidance”, “why should I subsidise them” and “it’s only fair they pay something”.



Why on earth should they pay for something out of their pockets? That’s what other peoples’ taxes are for.

Share this...FacebookTwitterFor some renewable energy proponents, it simply doesn’t matter what hard facts showing wind and solar make little sense get put on the table, they’ll religiously insist that it’s the best thing ever in energy technology.
Germany for example has invested massively in wind and solar energy in an attempt to replace its coal and nuclear plants, which environmentally fell out of the public’s favor during the end of the last century and early 21st century. Unfortunately Germany’s mad rush into wind and sun dubbed the Energiewende) (transition to renewable energy) is not paying off.
Today Germany’s online FOCUS reports on a new survey of international experts concerning the success of the German Energiewende: “World Energy Council warns: German Energiewende threatens Europe’s power supply reliability / Experts: no “export hit“. FOCUS writes:
International experts are harboring huge doubt over the success of the German Energiewende. This is the result of a survey by the World Energy Council… […]. Three quarters of those surveyed see a threat from the Energiewende to the supply stability of power in Europe. Two thirds believe the Energiewende will weaken the German economy over the short and mid-term. Only three percent believe Germany will accomplish its transition to renewable energies within the prescribed timeframe.”
FOCUS explains how the World Energy Council is an international association of the energy industry and that it surveys its members on a regular basis. “The current survey questioned experts in 35 countries, 20 of which were from Europe.”

The World Energy Council writes at its site here that about 60% of the experts who were surveyed say that industrial customers in their countries reject higher electricity prices, also even if they contribute to protecting the climate. About 50% of the experts believe that private households would accept slightly higher energy prices.
On whether the German model is feasible in other countries, 82% do not see the economic and technical conditions being at hand for a German-type Energiewende in their own countries.
FOCUS cites the President of the German Committee of the World Energy Council, Uwe Franke:
Foremost the fear of a considerable worsening in supply stability is worrisome. ‘We have to take the fears of our neighbors very seriously,’ Franke demands. ‘The supply reliability for electricity depends foremeost on the quality of the technical infrastructure.’“
Right now as it is, the quality of the renewable energy supply infrastructure is gravely lacking, as there exists no national transmission line to take power from Germany’s offshore wind parks to industry located inland in southern Germany. Moreover no economical technology exists for storing surplus energy nor is any in sight.

"NAIROBI, Kenya  —   Ismail Ali Ibrahim gave away everything he owned: his bed, his sheets, his shirts, his pots, his pans, his plates, even his house. He didn’t care. He was going to America. But this week, he remained 7, 000 miles away, marooned with more than 100 other Somali refugees in a spartan transit center in central Nairobi that smelled of nervous sweat. Mr. Ibrahim and many of his displaced comrades had been waiting more than two decades to be resettled in the United States and were supposed to fly to America this week. But their hopes were crushed by President Trump’s executive order to freeze the refugee flow into the United States for at least four months. More than 25, 000 refugees from Somalia, one of the poorest, hungriest,   countries on earth, were in the pipeline to be resettled in the United States. Mr. Ibrahim was much closer than most  —   so close that, with his ticket, paperwork and bag all zipped up, the thought of it made his voice quiver. He had waited 26 long years for this, living in a sweltering, crowded,   refugee camp along the   border that is the opposite of hope. Now his worst fears are shaping up. The Somali refugees who had already been extensively vetted and approved by several American government agencies will most likely be bused back to the camps. Many said that they feared for their lives and that their situation was actually worse than it had been before they came so close to leaving. “Trump shocked us,” Mr. Ibrahim said. Most of them are now broke, having just two weeks ago given away their worldly possessions in a spree of happiness to friends less fortunate. But more worrisome, many refugees said as they gathered under the shade of a mango tree at the transit center, was the risk that they could be labeled “friends of America. ” That’s a dangerous tag in a poorly policed refugee camp crawling with Islamic militants. “The Shabab will be suspicious of us,” said Deck Abdi Korriyow, another refugee, referring to the militant group that has slaughtered thousands of people across eastern Africa. “They don’t want anyone resettled to the U. S. They’ll think we’ve been giving information to the Americans. ” Several men around him vigorously nodded when he added, “Who knows what will happen to us next?” Kenya is home to hundreds of thousands of Somali refugees and many are treated terribly  —   constantly harassed, arrested, often beaten, discriminated against, kept in large camps or locked in a soccer stadium during police roundups, and sometimes they have even disappeared. Many Kenyans see Somalia the way much of the world does: as a terrorist threat. So the refugees have set their sights on a faraway dream. It’s called America. The United States runs a vigorous resettlement program, taking in thousands of Somalis each year. Being one of them is like holding a winning lottery ticket and it generates a lot of envy. Some of the refugees said another reason they dreaded going back to the camps was because they knew some of their neighbors would barely be able to contain their glee that the resettlement had not worked out. “The people against me will be happy,” Mr. Ibrahim said. The more than 100 approved refugees here are now stuck because they don’t have proper papers to walk the streets of Nairobi. They were supposed to be walking the streets of Atlanta, Buffalo, Des Moines and St. Louis by now. They aren’t allowed to leave the transit center, which is in Nairobi’s old Indian quarter it was supposed to be their last stop. The gate here is large and unmarked. Security is serious many of the refugees who pass through here are hunted in their homelands. On Wednesday, the center was crowded but relatively quiet. The refugees seemed bored. Somali women in full veils lay on the sidewalk on their backs. Young men lounged in a row of scratched up chairs and were not even talking to one another. When a   mango fell from the tree, a little boy pounced on it, clearly hungry. The men spoke of “the stress. ” “Am I worried?” asked Salad Rage Saleh, thin and antsy. “Ever since I’ve been born I’ve been worried. ” American officials did not address the fears of Shabab reprisals directly. One State Department official said that the government would continue to show compassion to refugees but that it was also important to protect American citizens. Refugee officials said the Shabab fears could be real, but that some refugees also played up such concerns in an attempt to delay or stop their return to the camps, which can be depressing on a good day. Life for many Somali refugees means confronting famine, anarchy, pestilence and death on a daily basis. Ever since the government collapsed in 1991, Somalia has been stuck in perpetual crisis. One set of three brothers at the transit camp fled Somalia after their parents were killed 25 years ago, trudging across the Kenya border as three lost souls. For more than a   the brothers had been living together in a small makeshift house in a refugee camp, usually jobless and surviving off the monthly United Nations rations, which they said had been cut down to seven pounds of grain, one cup of oil and a bottle capful of salt. The Kenyans have been threatening to close this camp because of terrorism fears. The brothers had just cleared the final medical checks to be resettled in Rhode Island. Ahmed Hassan, the eldest, a quiet man with a red pen in his pocket, spoke proudly of how in recent days they had been “trained” to wear jackets, hats and gloves when it was cold. While some Americans have said in recent days that they oppose Mr. Trump’s block on refugees, others have said it makes them feel safer. Refugee officials in East Africa have been quick to point out that, in the Somalis’ case, these refugees are among the most vetted people entering the United States. The resettlement process usually takes four to six years to complete and involves database checks, fingerprinting, countless forms and hours of background interviews. The tiny percentage of refugees who make it all the way through are selected because they are considered the most vulnerable of the vulnerable. Most will now return to the same squalid camps where they had been living for years. Others in the pipeline will be put on what the State Department calls indefinite hold. When this was announced at the transit center on Saturday at a meeting in the yard, several men cried. “It was pretty shattering for me,” said Lori Seymour, the official with the International Organization for Migration who made the announcement. This week, the group spoke of all the things they had been looking forward to in America: security, freedom, pizza, meat, driving a car and seeing buildings made not of sticks, but of “mirrors and stone,” as one man put it. “I was even looking forward to paying taxes,” Mr. Hassan said. “If you pay taxes, that means you have a job and you’re making money, right?”"

President Trump is [fulfilling his most important deregulatory promise](https://www.state.gov/on-the-u-s-withdrawal-from-the-paris-agreement/). On the 4th of November next year it will be a great day for America, as that is the date when the US withdrawal from the ruinous Paris Agreement will become final. 



**Press Statement:** [Michael R. Pompeo, Secretary of State](https://www.state.gov/biographies/michael-r-pompeo/)



November 4, 2019



Today the United States began the process to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Per the terms of the Agreement, the United States submitted formal notification of its withdrawal to the United Nations. The withdrawal will take effect one year from delivery of the notification. As noted in [his June 1, 2017 remarks](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-trump-paris-climate-accord/), President Trump made the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement because of the **unfair economic burden imposed** on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers by U.S. pledges made under the Agreement. 



The United States has reduced all types of emissions, even as we grow our economy and ensure our citizens’ access to affordable energy. Our results speak for themselves: U.S. emissions of criteria air pollutants that impact human health and the environment **declined** by 74% between 1970 and 2018. U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions **dropped** 13% from 2005-2017, even as our economy grew over 19 percent.



The U.S. approach incorporates the reality of the global energy mix and uses all energy sources and technologies cleanly and efficiently, including fossils fuels, nuclear energy, and renewable energy. In international climate discussions, we will continue to **offer a realistic and pragmatic model** – backed by a record of real world results – showing innovation and open markets lead to greater prosperity, fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy. 



We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters. Just as we have in the past, the United States will continue to research, innovate, and grow our economy while reducing emissions and extending a helping hand to our friends and partners around the globe. 



If only we had a realistic and pragmatic leader in charge of New Zealand who put our needs above the needs of huge third world countries. Instead we are saddled with a woman who cares more about gaining the approval of the nameless, faceless global elite from the UN than she cares about our primary industries and our food production. 



The National party that used to be the party of choice for most of us is no better, spinelessly going along with all this **economic sabotage** , foolishly thinking that they need to out-woke Labour in order to get back into power. With both major parties being woke it will not be long before New Zealand is BROKE!

Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the committee, it is a great pleasure to have been invited to share my “Perspectives on the Export‐​Import Bank of the United States” with you today. My intention is to focus primarily on the domestic victims of the Export‐​Import Bank (“Ex‐​Im”) by describing some of the hidden costs — the collateral damage — that are often overlooked or swept under the rug.



To the extent that today's hearing will help illuminate the holistic impact of Ex-Im on the U.S. economy and the market process — in contrast to the cherry-picked examples of how Ex-Im has helped particular companies meet their particular goals — I am pleased to participate and offer some assistance.



Before turning to that task, however, I would like to applaud the committee for taking up this important subject in a public hearing. Committed oversight of the executive branch by the legislative branch is crucial to our system of checks and balances, which must remain functionally robust to ensure the health of our constitutional republic, and protect it from even the most subtle encroachments.



 **Insulated in Export Rhetoric**



Everyone loves exports. In fact, many Americans think of trade as a competition between ""Us"" and ""Them,"" where exports are Team USA's points, imports are the foreign team's points, the trade account is the scoreboard, and the deficit on that scoreboard means our team is losing at trade. That narrative is wrong, but certainly ripe for exploitation by agencies that portray themselves as serving some national goal of boosting exports.



The economic fact of the matter is that the real benefits of trade are transmitted through imports, not through exports. As Milton Friedman used to say: imports are the goods and services we get to consume without having to produce; exports are the goods and services we produce, but don't get to consume.



The purpose of exchange is to enable each of us to focus on what we do best. By specializing in an occupation — instead of allocating small portions of our time to producing each of the necessities and luxuries we wish to consume — and exchanging the monetized output we produce most efficiently for the goods and services we produce less efficiently, we are able to produce and, thus, consume more output than would be the case if we didn't specialize and trade. By extension, the larger the size of the market, the greater is the scope for specialization, exchange, and economic growth.



When we transact at the local supermarket or hardware store, we seek to maximize the value we obtain by getting the most for our dollars. In other words, we want to import more value from the local merchant than we wish to export. In our daily transactions, we seek to run personal trade deficits. But when it comes to trading across borders or when our individual transactions are aggregated at the national level, we forget these basics principles and assume the goal of exchange is to achieve a trade surplus. But, as Adam Smith famously observed: ""What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.""



The benefits of trade come from imports, which deliver more competition, greater variety, lower prices, better quality, and innovation. Arguably, opening foreign markets should be _an aim_ of trade policy because larger markets allow for greater specialization and economies of scale, but real free trade requires liberalization at home. The real benefits of trade are measured by the value of imports that can be purchased with a unit of exports — the so-called terms of trade. Trade barriers at home raise the costs and reduce the amount of imports that can be purchased with a unit of exports.



Yet, in Washington, exports are associated with increased economic output and job creation, while imports are presumed to cause economic contraction and job loss. But that is demonstrably false. The first1 of the two charts below plots annual changes in imports and annual changes in GDP for 44 years. If imports caused economic contraction, we would expect to see most of the observations in the upper left and lower right quadrants — depicting an inverse relationship. Instead, we see a strong positive relationship. In 43 of 44 years, imports and GDP moved in the same direction.





The second2 chart plots annual changes in imports and U.S. employment. Similarly, there is a fairly strong positive relationship between these variables, as well.





In keeping with the conventional Washington wisdom that exports are Team America's points and imports are the foreign team's points, in his January 2010 State of the Union address President Obama set a national goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. That goal was subsequently enshrined as the ""National Export Initiative,"" which decreed establishment of an Export Promotion Cabinet ""to develop and coordinate the implementation of the NEI."" Six months later, the new cabinet produced its recommendations in a 68-page report titled ""The Export Promotion Cabinet's Plan for Doubling U.S. Exports in Five Years,"" which became the centerpiece of the administration's trade policy agenda.



Most prominent in the plan was a larger role for government in promoting exports, including expanded nonmarket lending programs to finance export activity, an increase in the number of the Commerce Department's foreign outposts to promote U.S. business, an increase in federal agency-chaperoned marketing trips, and other sundry subsidies for export-oriented business activities. Ex-Im suddenly had a more prominent role to play.



Shortsightedly, the NEI systemically neglected a broad swath of opportunities to facilitate exports by contemplating only the export-focused activities of exporters. The NEI presumed that the only barriers impeding U.S. exporters were foreign made. But before companies become exporters, they are producers. And as producers, they are subject to a host of domestic laws, regulations, taxes, and other policies that handicap them in their competition for sales in the U.S. market and abroad.



For example, nearly 60 percent of the value of U.S. imports in 2014 comprised of intermediate goods, capital goods, and other raw materials — the purchases of U.S. businesses, not consumers.3 Yet, many of those imported inputs are subject to customs duties, which raise the cost of production for the U.S.-based companies that need them, making them less competitive at home and abroad. Indeed, U.S. duties on products like sugar, steel, magnesium, polyvinyl chloride, and other crucial manufacturing inputs have chased companies to foreign shores — where those crucial ingredients are less expensive — and deterred foreign companies from setting up shop stateside.4



To nurture the promise of our highly integrated global economy, policymakers should stop conflating the interests of exporters with the national interest and commit to policies that reduce frictions throughout the supply chain — from product conception to consumption. Why should U.S. taxpayers underwrite — and U.S. policymakers promote — the interests of exporters, anyway, when the benefits of those efforts accrue, primarily, to the shareholders of the companies enjoying the subsidized marketing or matchmaking? There is no national ownership of private export revenues. And the relationship between revenues (domestic or export) and jobs is today more tenuous than in years past.



Globalization means that companies have growing options with respect to where and how they produce. So governments must compete for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions; and so on. The crucial question for U.S. policymakers is: why not focus on reforms that make the U.S. economy a more attractive location for both domestic and foreign investment?



According to the Congressional Research Service, there are approximately 20 federal government agencies involved in supporting U.S. exports, either directly or indirectly. Among the nine key agencies with programs or activities directly related to export promotion are the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Small Business Administration, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and the Export-Import Bank.



Relative to attracting domestic investment, export promotion is a circuitous and uncertain path to economic growth and job creation. If policymakers seek a more appropriate target for economic policy, it should be attracting and retaining investment, which is the seed of all economic activity, including exporting.



 **Problems with Ex-Im's Rationalizations**



The mission of the Ex-Im is ""to support American jobs by facilitating the export of U.S. goods and services."" Given the exalted status of exports in Washington's economic policy narrative, it is understandable why Ex-Im would portray itself as indispensable to U.S. export success. It's a reasonable survival strategy. But on the metric of contribution to export success, Ex-Im is scarcely relevant. It supported $27.4 billion in exports in 2014, which is less than 2 percent of all U.S. exports last year.5



Of course, $27 billion is nothing to sneeze at, but the implication that most, if not all, of those sales would never have happened in the absence of Ex-Im is pure nonsense. But the more important question is not whether Ex-Im supports U.S. exports. That's the political question. The relevant economic question concerns the costs and benefits of Ex-Im to the U.S. economy.



Proponents limit their analyses to the impact of Ex-Im on taxpayers. In recent years, it has generated positive returns to the Treasury, but that myopic focus doesn't come close to approximating the appropriate cost-benefit analysis.



While the benefits of Ex-Im's activities are real to the recipients and visible to the public (the value of exports supported, projects financed, insurance policies underwritten are all highly touted), the costs imposed on non-beneficiaries usually go unseen by its victims — and unacknowledged by Ex-Im and its supporters. Identifying and quantifying those costs are necessary to measuring the net benefits.



Ex-Im supporters claim that the bank fills a void left by private sector lenders unwilling to finance certain riskier transactions and, by doing so, contributes importantly to U.S. export and job growth. Moreover, rather than burden taxpayers, the Bank generates profits for the Treasury, helps small businesses succeed abroad, encourages exports of ""green"" goods, contributes to development in sub-Saharan Africa, and helps ""level the playing field"" for U.S. companies competing in export markets with foreign companies supported by their own governments' generous export financing programs. So what's not to like about Ex-Im?



First, by dismissing the risk assessments of private-sector, profit-maximizing financial firms and making lending decisions based on nonmarket criteria to pursue often opaque, political objectives, Ex-Im misallocates resources and puts taxpayer dollars at risk. That Ex-Im is currently self-financing and generating revenues is entirely beside the point. Ex-Im's revenue stream depends on whether foreign borrowers are willing and able to service their loans, which is a function of global economic conditions beyond the control of Ex-Im. Given the large concentration of aircraft loans in its portfolio, for example, Ex-Im is heavily exposed to the consequences of a decline in demand for air travel. Recall that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also showed book profits for years until the housing market suddenly crashed and taxpayers were left holding the bag.



Second, even if taxpayers had tolerance for such risk taking, the claim that Ex-Im exists to help small businesses is belied by the fact that most of Ex-Im's loan portfolio value is concentrated among a handful of large U.S. companies. In 2013 roughly 75 percent of the value of Ex-Im loans, guarantees, and insurance were granted on behalf of 10 large companies, including Boeing, General Electric, Dow Chemical, Bechtel, and Caterpillar.



Third, the claim that U.S. exporters need assistance with financing to ""level the playing field"" with China and others doesn't square with the fact that the United States is a major export credit subsidizer that has been engaged in doling out such largesse since well before the founding of the People's Republic of China. It implies the United States is helpless at the task of reining in these subsidies. And it implies the United States lacks enormous advantages among the multitude of factors that inform the purchasing decision. But, somehow, 98 percent of U.S. export value is sold without the assistance of trade promotion agencies.



Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, by trying to ""level the playing field"" with foreign companies backed by their own governments, Ex-Im ""unlevels"" the playing field for many more U.S. companies competing at home and abroad. This adverse effect has been ignored, downplayed, or mischaracterized, but the collateral damage is substantial and should be a central part of the story.



 **The Collateral Damage to Ex-Im's Victims**



A proper accounting reveals that Ex-Im's practices impose significant costs on manufacturing firms across every industry and in every U.S. state. When Ex-Im provides financing to a U.S. company's foreign customer on terms more favorable than he can secure elsewhere, it may be facilitating a transaction that would not otherwise occur. That is the basis for Ex-Im's claim that it helps the U.S. economy by increasing exports and ""supporting"" jobs. But the claim is questionable because those resources might have created more value or more jobs if deployed in the private sector instead. If that is the case, Ex-Im's transaction imposes a net loss on the economy. But suppose it could be demonstrated that Ex-Im transactions grow the economy larger or create more jobs than if those resources had been deployed in the private sector instead. Would Ex-Im then be correct in its claim? No. Further analysis is required.



Ex-Im financing helps two sets of companies (in the short-run): U.S. firms whose export prices are subsidized by below market rate financing and the foreign firms who purchase those subsidized exports. It stands to reason, then, that those same transactions might impose costs on two different sets of companies: competing U.S. firms in the same industry who do not get Ex-Im backing, and U.S. firms in downstream industries, whose foreign competition is now benefitting from reduced capital costs courtesy of U.S. government subsidies. While Ex-Im financing reduces the cost of doing business for the lucky U.S. exporter and reduces the cost of capital for his foreign customer, it hurts U.S. competitors of the U.S. exporter, as well as U.S. competitors of his foreign customer by putting them at relative cost disadvantages.



These effects are neither theoretical nor difficult to comprehend. Yet proponents of Ex-Im reauthorization rarely acknowledge, let alone concede, that these are real costs pertinent to any legitimate net benefits calculation. Instead, they speak only of the gross benefits of export subsidies, which they consider to be the value of exports supported by their authorizations.



But there are at least three sets of costs that are essential to determining the net benefits of Ex-Im: (1) the "" **Opportunity Cost** ,"" represented by the export growth that would have obtained had Ex-Im's resources been deployed in the private sector; (2) the "" **Intra-Industry Cost** ,"" represented by the relative cost disadvantage imposed on the other U.S. firms in the same industry (the domestic competitors) as a result of Ex-Im's subsidies to a particular firm in the industry, and; (3) the "" **Downstream Industry Cost** ,"" represented by the relative cost disadvantage imposed on the U.S. competitors of the subsidized foreign customer.



Opportunity Cost is difficult to estimate, but suffice it to recognize that opportunity costs exist. Indeed, opportunity costs exist whenever there are foregone alternatives to the path chosen.



The Intra-Industry Cost is somewhat easier to calculate, in theory. If Ex-Im provides a $50 million loan to a foreign farm equipment manufacturer to purchase steel from U.S. Steel Corporation, the transaction may benefit U.S. Steel, but it hurts competitors like Nucor, Steel Dynamics, AK Steel, and dozens of other steel firms operating in the United States and competing for the same customers at home and abroad. The $50 million subsidy to U.S. Steel is a cost to the other firms in the industry, who can attribute a $50 million revenue gap between them (aggregated) and U.S. Steel to a government intervention that picked a winner and made them, relatively speaking, losers. The $50 million ""benefit"" for U.S. Steel is a $50 million cost to the other steel firms.



But then that distortion is compounded when taking into consideration the dynamics that would have played out had the best firm — the one offering the most value for the best price — secured that export deal instead. Reaching revenue targets, raising capital, and moving down the production cost curve to generate lower unit costs all become more difficult to achieve on account of the original intervention, amplifying the adverse impact on other firms in the industry.



When government intervenes with subsidies that tilt the playing field in favor of a particular firm, it simultaneously penalizes the other firms in the industry and changes the competitive industry dynamics going forward. Every Ex-Im transaction touted as boosting U.S. exports creates victims within the same U.S. industry. Without Ex-Im's intervention, Nucor might have been able to win that foreign farm equipment producer's business, which is a prospect that undermines the premise that Ex-Im boosts exports at all and reinforces the point that it merely shifts resources around without creating value, possibly destroys value instead. What is given to U.S. steel is taken from Nucor and the other firms, among whom may be the more efficient producers.



The Downstream Industry costs are those imposed by the transaction on the U.S. companies that compete with the foreign customer. When a foreign farm machinery producer purchases steel on credit at subsidized interest rates, it obtains an advantage over its competitors — including its U.S. competitors. So, when that subsidized rate comes courtesy of a U.S. government program committed to increasing U.S. exports, it only seems reasonable to consider the effects on firms in downstream U.S. industries before claiming the program a success: Has the subsidy to the foreign farm machinery producer made John Deere, Caterpillar, New Holland, or other U.S. farm machinery producers less competitive? Has it hurt their bottom lines?



Delta Airlines has been vocal in its objection to Ex-Im-facilitated sales of Boeing jetliners to foreign carriers, such as Air India. Delta rightly complains that the U.S. government, as a matter of policy, is subsidizing Delta's foreign competition by reducing Air India's cost of capital. That cost reduction enables Air India to offer lower prices in its bid to compete for passengers, which has a direct impact on Delta's bottom line. This is a legitimate concern and it is not limited to this example.



Consider the generic case. A U.S. supplier sells to both U.S. and foreign customers. Those customers compete in the same downstream industry in the U.S. and foreign markets. Ex-Im is happy to provide financing to facilitate the sale, as its mission is to increase exports and create jobs. The U.S. supplier is thrilled that Ex-Im is providing his foreign customer with cheap credit because it spares him from having to offer a lower price or from sweetening the deal in some other way to win the business. The foreign customer is happy to accept the advantageous financing for a variety of reasons, among which is the fact that his capital costs are now lower relative to what they would have been and relative to the costs of his competitors — including his U.S. competitors, who are now on the outside looking in. Ex-Im helps some U.S. companies increase their exports sales. But it hinders other U.S. companies' efforts to compete at home and abroad.



Moreover, by subsidizing export sales, Ex-Im artificially diverts domestic supply, possibly causing U.S. prices to rise and rendering U.S. customers less important to their U.S. suppliers. Especially in industries where there are few producers, numerous customers, and limited substitute products, Ex-Im disrupts the relationships between U.S. buyers and U.S. sellers by infusing the latter with greater market power and leverage. Delta was able to connect the dots. Other companies have, too. But most of the time, the downstream U.S. companies are unwitting victims of this silent cost-shifting.



According to the findings in a recent Cato Institute study that I authored, the downstream costs alone amount to a tax of approximately $2.8 billion every year.6 The victims of this shell game include companies in each of the 21 broad U.S. manufacturing industry classifications used by the government to compile statistics. And they are scattered across the country in every state. Among the stealthily taxed were companies such as Western Digital and Seagate Technologies — two California-based computer storage device producers that employ 125,000 workers; Chicago-based Schneider Electric Holdings, which employs 23,000 workers in the manufacture of environmental control products, and; ViaSystems, a St. Louis-based printed circuit board producer with 12,000 employees. These companies haven't received Ex-Im subsidies, but companies in their supplier industries have, which effectively lowers the costs of their foreign competitors.



While it is relatively easy for a big company like Delta to connect the dots and see that Boeing is being favored at its expense (airplane purchases constitute a large share of Delta's total costs), most manufacturing companies are unaware that they are shouldering the costs of government subsidies to their own competitors. But the victims include big and small producers — of electrical equipment, appliances, furniture, food, chemicals, computers, electronics, plastics and rubber products, paper, metal, textiles — from across the country. Companies producing telecommunications equipment incur an estimated collective tax of $125 million per year.



The industries in which companies bear the greatest burdens — where the costs of Ex-Im's subsidies to foreign competitors are the highest — are of vital importance to the manufacturing economies of most states. In Oregon, Delaware, Idaho, New Jersey, Nevada, and Maryland, the 10 industries shouldering the greatest costs account for at least 80 percent of the state's manufacturing output. The most important industry is among the ten most burdened by these costs in 33 of 50 states. The chemical industry, which bears a cost of $107 million per year, is the largest manufacturing industry in 12 states.



For all the praise Ex-Im heaps upon itself for its role as a costless pillar of the economy, it is difficult to make sense of the collateral damage left in its wake. Thousands of U.S. companies would be better off if Ex-Im's charter were allowed to expire, as scheduled, on June 30.



 **What to do about Foreign Export Credit Agencies?**



Of all of the arguments put forward by Ex-Im supporters, the ""leveling the playing field"" rationale seems to carry the most sway. It is appealing intuitively. But the implication that the United States is an innocent party that has no choice but to follow suit is laughable. The United States invented this stuff.



The notion that because Beijing, Brasilia, and Brussels subsidize their exporters Washington must, too, is a rationalization that sweeps under the rug the fact that there are dozens of criteria that feed into the ultimate purchasing decision, including product quality, price, producer's reputation, local investment and employment opportunities created by the sale, warranties, after-market servicing, and the extent to which the transaction contributes toward building a long-term relationship between buyer and seller. To say that U.S. exporters need assistance with financing to ""level the playing field"" suggests that they lack advantages among the multitude of factors that inform the purchasing decision. Moreover, the fact that less than 2 percent of U.S. export value goes through export promotion agencies suggests this rationale for Ex-Im is bogus.



There is a way to bring foreign subsidies under control, however. The United States should allow Ex-Im to expire at the end of this month and then announce plans to bring cases to the World Trade Organization against governments operating their export credit agencies in violation of agreed upon limits under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The combination of the carrot of U.S. withdrawal from the business of export credit financing and the stick of WTO litigation would likely incent other governments to reduce, and possibly eliminate, their own subsidy programs.



 **Conclusion**



Most of the rationales for keeping the Export-Import Bank are merely rationalizations that don't stand up to close scrutiny. Perhaps most problematic are the costs imposed, often on unwitting victims. Ex-Im subsidies to particular exporters may help those companies succeed, but they impose significant costs on other firms in the same industry and firms in downstream industries. Accordingly, Ex-Im penalizes many smaller, dynamic, up-and-coming businesses that are often the well springs of new ideas, better mousetraps, and smarter business practices and which the economy needs to spawn subsequent generations of businesses in perpetuity. 



That evolutionary process underlies the strength of the U.S. economy, and is essential to U.S. success going forward. On the other hand, U.S. economic strength is undermined when subsidies are deployed in a spiraling race with other nations to the detriment of the next crop of leading U.S. businesses. Let the Export-Import Bank expire.

Back in 2008, chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian co‐​authored a paper showing that India had overtaken China in outward FDI as a proportion of GDP. Typically, FDI flows from rich to poor countries, and many Indian economists warned in 1991 that Indian industry would be decimated by multinationals if India opened up. Subramanian showed that Indian companies not only held their own, but invested aggressively overseas. Result: India’s outward FDI was 0.9% of GDP, higher than China’s 0.6%.



 **Bye, Buy**



Many cheered this development. But today, outward FDI reveals more follies than blessings. This should be a warning to many acquisitions in the pipeline. Indian companies must reassess the risks and gains of investing abroad. History shows that most acquisitions and mergers reduce, rather than add, value. When economies are booming, profits are high and borrowing easy. So, companies use plentiful cash and credit for acquisitions. It seems an easy way of increasing sales and profits.



But in a boom buy, prices are high, and future profit projections tend to be over‐​optimistic. Aggressive bidding often results in sky‐​high prices that nobody would bid in more normal times. This is sometimes called the winner’s curse. When the boom ends, as all booms do, sales and profits fall way beyond expectations. Acquirers suffer huge losses that have to be written down, above all in countries with depreciating currencies.



Thanks to luck or good management, some acquisitions do succeed. Tata’s acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) was a fabulous success. The huge losses of Tata Motors at home have more than been offset by JLR’s profits abroad. But the same group’s acquisition of British steel company Corus has been a disaster.



Tata has sold some of Corus’ assets and written down $1.6 billion to reflect its subsidiary’s woes. This is probably not enough: if auctioned today, Corus might fetch barely half the $13 billion Tata paid for it.



Kumar Mangalam Birla’s $6‐​billion acquisition of Novelis has proved indifferent, if not erroneous. His flagship company Hindalco took an impairment hit of Rs 1,380 crore on its Australian arm, Aditya Birla Minerals, where it had to stop copper production due to a sinkhole incident.



Crompton Greaves and Suzlon have lost heavily on foreign acquisitions. Naveen Jindal went for an iron ore mine in Bolivia, but had to quit after substantial losses.



Reliance has become India’s biggest company, but its foreign ventures have fared poorly. It acquired Hoechst’s polyester plant in Germany but had to shut that after big losses. It took up oil exploration in seven countries, but failed to find any worthwhile deposits. It invested heavily in shale gas/​oil companies in the US, and this initially looked an excellent bet, but that’s no longer so after the sharp fall in the price of oil and gas.



Most Indians were delighted when Lakshmi Mittal acquired France’s Arcelor, to make ArcelorMittal the biggest steel company in the world. But its share price today has slumped to €9.70, against the acquisition price of $40.37.



 **Steel a Steal**



Mittal started his global empire by buying up bankrupt public sector steel plants at throwaway prices, sometimes close to zero. He was able to turn these around in country after country. That was truly a winning strategy. But when he changed his strategy and went for a big‐​time buy at a high price, he suffered badly.



All major Indian pharmaceutical companies have become multinationals. Many of their foreign acquisitions yielded poor or negative returns for years. Today, many of their foreign operations have started looking good. The companies concerned say these were long‐​term bets that have finally paid off. Most of India’s top pharma companies now have higher sales abroad than at home.



A highly successful acquirer has been Motherson Sumi, an auto parts company unheard of 20 years ago that has become one of the world’s biggest, with 75% of its sales outside India. Bharat Forge and Amtek Auto have also made many foreign acquisitions, but with a mixed record.



The commodity boom of 2003-11 induced many Indian companies to invest in established coal companies or new mines in Indonesia and Mozambique, with disastrous results. GVK, Lanco and Adani aim to invest billions of dollars in Australian coal mines deep inland that require new rail lines and ports. The projects look very risky at today’s low coal prices.



Climate change worries may slash global power capacity based on coal, worsening the coal glut and attendant prices. Surely, a better strategy will be to wait for coal companies in some countries to go bust and then acquire those cheaply.



Opportunism will always beat gigantism in foreign acquisitions. Lakshmi Mittal fared brilliantly when he took over bust companies and turned them around. JLR had lost money for years under Ford and BMW, so Tata got it relatively cheap.



Cheapness alone is not enough: many cheap buys have flopped. The trick lies in discerning hidden value in depressed stock. That should be the guiding principle of future buys.

"**Labour is joining the advertising boycott of Facebook ""in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement"", one of the party's senior MPs has said.**
Shadow minister Rachel Reeves told the BBC the party wanted ""to express our concern about the failure of Facebook to take down some hateful material"".
Companies including consumer goods firm Unilever have also joined the campaign.
Facebook has said harmful posts would be removed but some could stay if they have news value.
The Facebook advertising boycott was started by the ""Stop Hate for Profit"" campaign in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody in the US city of Minneapolis.
The organisers, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, accused Facebook of allowing ""racist, violent and verifiably false content to run rampant on its platform"".
Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Ms Reeves said: ""All MPs in the Labour Party use Facebook to get across our message, but what we're not doing at the moment is advertising on Facebook.
""And that is in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter campaign but also in line with what many businesses are doing this month, which is to express our concerns about the failure of Facebook to take down some hateful material from their platform and take more responsibility for the lies and propaganda that are sometimes put out there on Facebook.
""Facebook needs to do more to take responsibility and this is just one way that businesses and the Labour Party and others can put pressure on Facebook to do the right things and take tougher action on hate crime and hate speech.""
Of the Â£40m spent by political parties during the 2017 election, around Â£3m went directly on Facebook ads, with the Conservatives spending twice as much as all the other parties combined.
Responding to the campaign towards the end of June, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg defended the firm's record of taking down hate speech, pointing to a European Commission report that found the social network removed 86% of hate speech last year, up from 82.6%.
He said ads would be banned if they describe different groups, based on descriptors such as race or immigration status, as a threat - as well as content deemed to incite violence or suppress voting.
However he also said occasionally content that violated the company's policies would be left up ""if the public interest value outweighs the risk of harm"".
""Often, seeing speech from politicians is in the public interest, and in the same way that news outlets will report what a politician says, we think people should generally be able to see it for themselves on our platforms,"" he said.
""We will soon start labelling some of the content we leave up because it is deemed newsworthy, so people can know when this is the case,"" he said."
"The chancellor of the exchequer must lay out urgent plans to realign government spending with the target to cut carbon emissions to net zero, or risk missing the target and fuelling high carbon emissions for years to come, Labour has urged. The warning comes as the Treasury prepares key policy announcements on the UK’s recovery from the coronavirus recession, which Rishi Sunak is expected to set out in his spending review next week.  Environmental campaigners are pinning their hopes on the chancellor proving more receptive to a green recovery than the prime minister, after Boris Johnson set out his vision for a “new deal” this week in which the climate crisis merited barely a mention, but “newt counting” was singled out as “a drag on productivity”. Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said a key test for Sunak would be the Treasury’s Green Book, a set of guidelines that governs how ministers and civil servants appraise and evaluate policy, projects and programmes. Streeting wants to see sweeping reforms. “The Treasury really is crucial [and] should step up,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “A reform of the Green Book should have net zero writ large, so that the civil servants and ministers making appraisals of policy can take account of whether those policies help or hinder reaching net zero.” The Green Book matters because in the past many proposed green policies, such as incentives for low-carbon energy, or infrastructure building, have fallen foul of the Treasury’s criteria on value for money. But if the net zero target, enshrined in law last year, is to be reached then it must also be made a key criterion for the Treasury. “They are squandering this opportunity,” said Streeting. “The government approach to climate change reeks of complacency. But the Committee on Climate Change has warned that they’re not going far enough, fast enough. There is no plan for net zero.” Streeting also called for the chancellor to put in place a programme of energy efficiency improvements for Britain’s homes: the draughtiest in Europe and a leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. On electric vehicles, he said the government needed to provide more incentives to car-owners. He urged the chancellor to fund a new green infrastructure bank, that would provide public money and attract private sector investment for big projects such as improving the railways and public transport. The long-awaited national infrastructure strategy has been put off until this autumn, which will also delay net zero plans, he warned. “There is no shortage of ideas and recommendations [on how to ensure the economic recovery is in line with the net zero target] but what’s missing is leadership and action,” Streeting said. If the government were to bring forward plans for a green recovery, Labour would support them, he pledged. “We worked constructively with the government on the coronavirus crisis,” he pointed out. “Net zero is a cross-party issue.” The Liberal Democrats are also pushing for the government to ensure its spending plans lead to a green recovery, after Johnson’s “new deal” announcement held little new policy on cutting emissions. The party is hoping for wider backing for a new draft bill that would require the secretary of state to help the 2.6m households in England living in fuel poverty, making fuel bills cheaper and reducing the UK’s carbon footprint. The private member’s bill would require the government to ensure all fuel-poor households were brought up to energy performance band C by 2030 and all other households to the same band by 2035. The Liberal Democrat peer and former MP for Bath, Don Foster, told the Guardian that the government had promised such action on fuel poverty in 2017 but had failed to follow through. “The prime minister has promised a green recovery to help rescue our economy from the coronavirus crisis – however, we are yet to see any concrete action,” he said. “If this government is determined to prove their green recovery is more than just empty promises, they need to be more ambitious. Backing this bill would be a welcome start.” A Treasury spokesperson said: “The Green Book requires that environmental impacts – including the impact on our net zero target – are considered in all government investment decisions. We remain committed to tackling climate change and as our economy reopens following from the coronavirus outbreak we will seeks to drive clean, sustainable growth across all regions. This includes continuing the review of the Green Book and our processes for allocating funding.” Next week, after the chancellor’s announcement, the UK will be one of the leading participants in a key summit on the green recovery, to be held by the International Energy Agency with the US, China, India, Brazil and the EU participating. The UK will be in the spotlight as host of the next UN climate summit, Cop26, postponed to next year. Streeting said: “Cop26 is the last chance saloon. The UK has a huge responsibility to the rest of the world. But we are clearly behind on Cop26. We need to do more.”"
"The science of climate change is more than 150 years old and it is probably the most tested area of modern science. However the energy industry, political lobbyists and others have spent the last 30 years sowing doubt about the science where none really exists. The latest estimate is that the world’s five largest publicly-owned oil and gas companies spend about US$200m each year on lobbying to control, delay or block binding climate-motivated policy. This organised and orchestrated climate change science denial has contributed to the lack of progress in reducing global green house gas (GHG) emissions - to the point that we are facing a global climate emergency. And when climate change deniers use certain myths – at best fake news and at worse straight lies – to undermine the science of climate change, ordinary people can find it hard to see through the fog. Here are five commonly used myths and the real science that debunks them.   The climate of the Earth has always changed, but the study of palaeoclimatology or “past climates” shows us that the changes in the last 150 years – since the start of the industrial revolution – have been exceptional and cannot be natural. Modelling results suggest that future predicted warming could be unprecedented compared to the previous 5m years. The “natural changes” argument is supplemented with the story that the Earth’s climate is just recovering from the cooler temperatures of the Little Ice Age (1300-1850AD) and that temperatures today are really the same as the Medieval Warm Period (900–1300AD). The problem is that both the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warming period were not global but regional changes in climate affecting north-west Europe, eastern America, Greenland and Iceland.  A study using 700 climate records showed that, over the last 2,000 years, the only time the climate all around the World has changed at the same time and in the same direction has been in the last 150 years, when over 98% of the surface of the planet has warmed. Sunspots are storms on the sun’s surface that come with intense magnetic activity and can be accompanied by solar flares. These sunspots do have the power to modify the climate on Earth. But scientists using sensors on satellites have been recording the amount of the sun’s energy hitting Earth since 1978 and there has been no upward trend. So they cannot be the cause of the recent global warming. Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are high-energy radiation that originates outside our solar system and may even be from distant galaxies. It has been suggested that they may help to seed or “make” clouds. So reduced GCRs hitting the Earth would mean fewer clouds, which would reflect less sunlight back into space and so cause Earth to warm.  But there are two problems with this idea. First, the scientific evidence shows that GCRs are not very effective at seeding clouds. And second, over the last 50 years, the amount of GCRs have actually increased, hitting record levels in recent years. If this idea were correct, GCRs should be cooling the Earth, which they aren’t. This is an attempt to play a classic common-sense card but is completely wrong. In 1856, American scientist Eunice Newton Foote conducted an experiment with an air pump, two glass cylinders and four thermometers. It showed that a cylinder containing carbon dioxide and placed in the sun trapped more heat and stayed warmer longer than a cylinder with normal air. Scientists have repeated these experiments in the laboratory and in the atmosphere, demonstrating again and again the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide.  As for the “common sense” scale argument that a very small part of something can’t have much of an effect on it, it only takes 0.1 grams of cyanide to kill an adult, which is about 0.0001% of your body weight. Compare this with carbon dioxide, which currently makes up 0.04% of the atmosphere and is a strong greenhouse gas. Meanwhile, nitrogen makes up 78% of the atmosphere and yet is highly unreactive. This is not true and a simplistic device used to attack the credibility of climate scientists. It would require a conspiracy covering thousands of scientists in more than a 100 countries to reach the scale required to do this. Scientists do correct and validate data all the time. For example we have to correct historic temperature records as how they were measured has changed. Between 1856 and 1941, most sea temperatures were measured using seawater hoisted on deck in a bucket. Even this was not consistent as there was a shift from wooden to canvas buckets and from sailing ships to steamships, which altered the height of the ship’s deck – and these changes in turn altered the amount of cooling caused by evaporation as the bucket was hoisted onto deck. Since 1941, most measurements have been made at the ship’s engine water intakes, so there’s no cooling from evaporation to account for.  We must also take account that many towns and cities have expanded and so that meteorological stations that were in rural areas are now in urban areas which are usually significantly warmer than the surrounding countryside. If we didn’t make these changes to the original measurements, then Earth’s warming over the last 150 years would have appeared to be even greater than the change that has actually been observed, which is now about 1˚C of global warming. This is incorrect and misunderstands how models work. It is a way of downplaying the seriousness of future climate change. There is a huge range of climate models, from those aimed at specific mechanisms such as the understanding of clouds, to general circulation models (GCMs) that are used to predict the future climate of our planet. There are over 20 major international centres where teams of some of smartest people in the world have built and run GCMs containing millions of lines of code representing the very latest understanding of the climate system. These models are continually tested against historic and palaeoclimate data as well as individual climate events such as large volcanic eruptions to make sure they reconstruct the climate, which they do extremely well. No single model should ever be considered correct as they represent a very complex global climate system. But having so many different models constructed and calibrated independently means that we can have confidence when the models agree.
Taking the whole range of climate models suggests a doubling of carbon dioxide could warm the planet by 2˚C to 4.5˚C, with an average of 3.1˚C. All the models show a significant amount of warming when extra carbon dioxide is added to the atmosphere. The scale of the predicted warming has remained very similar over the last 30 years despite the huge increase in the complexity of the models, showing it is a robust outcome of the science.   By combining all our scientific knowledge of natural (solar, volcanic, aerosols and ozone) and human-made (greenhouse gases and land-use changes) factors warming and cooling the climate shows that 100% of the warming observed over the last 150 years is due to humans. There is no scientific support for the continual denial of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up by the United Nations to openly and transparently summarise the science, provides six clear lines of evidence for climate change. As extreme weather becomes more and more common, people are realising that they do not need scientists to tell them the climate is changing – they are seeing and experiencing it first hand.

"“I’m not talking politics at all,” Tom Brady said in response to the first of several questions about, predictably, politics. Brady has been getting a lot of these, beginning with Super Bowl week’s Opening Night on Monday at Minute Maid Park in Houston. This is not your average    Super Bowl week in America. The chaos in Washington, bedlam at airports and protests across the country serve as an unsettling crowd noise to even the serene superstar quarterback for the New England Patriots. Brady is friends with President Trump. So are the Patriots’ owner, Robert Kraft, and Coach Bill Belichick. No sports team has been more closely associated with a new president, or perhaps any president, at least since Richard Nixon very publicly adopted the Washington Redskins as his own and even called occasional plays for Coach George Allen. Like Trump, the Patriots are a divisive juggernaut that tend to engender strong passions for and against. The team represents a kind of sporting ideal of Trump’s promise to make “America win so much, you’ll be bored of winning. ” New England, which will appear in an N. F. L.  ninth Super Bowl on Sunday, is a team that wins so much that a lot of America has become, yes, bored of its winning. And no small number of fans are convinced that the Patriots (like Trump) achieve their victories through dubious means and wish they would just go away and get off their TVs forever. The three main architects of the team’s success  —   Kraft, Belichick and Brady  —   have taken pains to emphasize that their allegiance to Trump is based on friendship and loyalty, nothing more. They play golf and attend weddings and call to congratulate one another on elections and Super Bowl wins, those kinds of everyday things. They are quick to assert their bipartisan or apolitical bona fides. Kraft has been a supporter of many Democrats and Democratic causes over the years Belichick declared himself apolitical in response to queries last fall after Trump at a campaign rally in New Hampshire read aloud from an effusive note of congratulations that Belichick had sent him. Brady started getting questions about Trump last fall when a red “Make America Great Again” cap was spotted in his Gillette Stadium locker, reportedly put there by Kraft. Brady at first gave sheepish,   responses suggesting that it would be cool to have a golf pal as president. (“There’d be a putting green on the White House lawn,” he predicted.) But the questions took on an edgier urgency as Trump’s victories and offenses kept mounting  —   ending with Trump where he is now, and Brady dropping into a reflexive   every time Trump’s name is mentioned to him. Brady, whose makeshift podium on the Minute Maid field on Monday night was swarmed with a few hundred reporters, was the central battlefield of incoming   questions. He countered with his most anodyne deflections. “I’m just a positive person” became Brady’s   blow off, which he also deployed in the face of several questions about Deflategate, the     scandal given new life this week by the prospect of Commissioner Roger Goodell’s having to award the Super Bowl trophy to the man he suspended for four games to begin this season. Other Atlanta Falcons and Patriots players were also invited to weigh in on political matter but mostly demurred. The Falcons receiver Mohamed Sanu, a practicing Muslim, was asked to discuss Trump’s executive order banning immigration from seven   countries. He declined politely, other than to say that it was “ a very tough situation” and “hard for me to talk about right now. ” I asked two of the more thoughtful members of the Patriots, the defensive linemen Alan Branch and Chris Long, if they had anything to say about these developments. They absolutely did, they said, and would speak out at some point later, but they did not want to create any “distractions” during Super Bowl week. The Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett did say that if the Patriots won on Sunday and were invited to the White House, he would probably not go, because “I don’t support the guy that’s in the [White] House. ” And really, was that so distracting? One enduring reason the Patriots are constantly being asked about their Trump connections is that the new president is hardly shy about reminding people of them. He has been dropping Brady’s name  —   and Kraft’s, and Belichick’s  —   at every opportunity over the last several months. This first became evident to me in the fall of 2015 as Trump was enjoying his unlikely rise to   status in the Republican primaries and I had several visits with him for a profile I was writing for the magazine. A few months earlier, I had written a story about Brady, who had just won his fourth Super Bowl and was then embroiled in the Deflategate fiasco, in which the league said it was “more probable than not” that Brady was “at least generally aware” that a minuscule amount of air pressure might have been removed from the footballs he used in the first half of the Patriots’   blowout of the Indianapolis Colts in the A. F. C. championship game. When Trump learned that I had recently spent time with Brady and around the Patriots, he became even more animated on the subject  —   and insistent that I enlist the star quarterback to say nice things about him for my story. “He’s a good friend of mine,” Trump said about Brady for the first of many times. “A really good friend of mine. ” Trump declared himself “disgusted” by the N. F. L. ’s treatment of Brady over Deflategate. “It’s so ridiculous what they’re doing to him. ” He mentioned he had just spoken to Brady. “He said: ‘Mr. Trump’  —   he calls me Mr. Trump, which he shouldn’t, because we play golf all the time. Anyway, he says: ‘Mr. Trump  —   Donald,’ he doesn’t even know what the [expletive] to call me. It’s the craziest thing. He’s a friend of mine. ” Also, Kraft  —   great friend, great friend. George Steinbrenner  —   “big time winner”  —   was Trump’s best friend, he said, and now Kraft is right up there, too, as one of his favorite guys. Kraft had visited him a few days earlier, and Trump said he chastised the Patriots owner for not fighting harder against the league’s suspension of Brady, in addition to other sanctions levied by the N. F. L. against the Patriots (including the loss of a   draft pick and a record fine). “You know, Bob Kraft is also one of my best friends,” Trump told me. “I said, ‘Bob, you should have never made the deal. ’” “Bob said, ‘I had a wink from the commissioner,’” Trump added, meaning that Kraft seemed to think that by standing down and not fighting the N. F. L. the league would reduce Brady’s penalty on appeal. Kraft was under pressure, Trump explained. “He choked, just like Romney choked. He said: ‘You know what? They winked at me.’ I said, ‘Bob when you make a deal, you should have gotten it all wrapped up.’ Who ever heard of making a deal like that? Now you got this mess. ” Kraft should never have trusted Goodell, he said. “The commissioner is a weak guy,” Trump said. “When he made the Ray Rice deal, everybody said: You’re stupid. You’re weak. And it was such a weak deal. So now he’s going overboard with their star, Brady. ” He added: “The commissioner is a dope. He’s a stupid guy. ” By far the best deal Kraft ever made was hiring Belichick, Trump said. Who, by the way, is also “a great, great friend” of Trump’s, even though everyone just assumes he’s “a really rough guy. ” “So I go to the Patriots game last year,” Trump said. “I’m on the sidelines with Kraft. He’s got Les Moonves right here. He’s got a lot of different people. And Belichick comes over in his Patriots sweatshirt and the hoodie and the whole thing. He hugs me, and he kisses me, and he said: ‘I love you. You’re the greatest. ’” Trump sat at his cluttered desk and seemed almost dreamy at the memory, as if the reception from Belichick genuinely moved him. “He just feels warmly toward me, Belichick does,” Trump said. “Isn’t that the craziest thing?” After the Deflategate ruling was handed down by the commissioner that spring, Trump said he tried to persuade Brady to sue the league personally. “I said, ‘Tom.’  —   I gave him a lawyer.  —   I said: ‘Here’s what you do. Sue the N. F. L. for $500 million tomorrow. Sue ’em up in Boston, for everything. They’ll come to the table.’ He said, ‘Aw, man.’ He really was torn. He’s not Trump. He said, ‘I just want to win another Super Bowl. ’” Trump told Brady that he understood. A few weeks later, the future president was showing me around Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. We were accompanied by Damon Winter, a Times photographer who had, a few months earlier, photographed Brady for the profile that was published in February. At one point, as Trump showed me around his   golf Xanadu on the Pacific, he looked over at Winter. “Who’s got a better body, me or Tom Brady?” he asked. (No answer from Winter that I recall.) In the course of my time with Trump, he kept urging me to call Brady and ask him about his great friendship with Trump. Brady would say great things, no doubt. “Ask him, ‘How is Trump as a golfer? ’” Trump urged. Brady had been particularly hunkered down during the Deflategate ordeal. N. F. L. politics can be brutal like the   kind. Plus, the   in the press over his friendship with Trump was not making Brady any more eager to engage beyond his usual helpings of football platitudes. Finally, after Trump kept insisting, I reached out to Brady, fully expecting a polite   from the quarterback, and who could blame him? “I really have no interest in political talk right now,” Brady wrote. “I have learned way too much about politics the last seven months. ”"
"

America looked at Imperial China as a potentially limitless consumer market. Washington sympathized with the republic under the Nationalists against Imperial Japan. Post‐​World War II China under Mao Zedong turned into a serious threat, eventually second only to that of the Soviet Union.



However, mutual fear of the USSR fostered rapprochement between the United States and the People’s Republic of China. After Mao’s death, the PRC adopted significant economic reforms, sparking rapid growth. Personal autonomy greatly increased. Political freedom lagged, but many Americans hoped rising income and expanding private enterprise would foster political liberalization.



Instead, after the crackdown in Tiananmen Square China adopted an unstable system of loose authoritarianism. Although challenging Chinese Communist Party control would result in prison, more general discussions of political and policy topics were tolerated, at least in academia. Foreign contacts expanded significantly. A semi‐​independent press developed, which could challenge local government malfeasance. Protests against abusive local officials were common. The CCP’s reputation crashed as corruption burgeoned.



Now, President Xi Jinping is pushing the PRC rapidly in the opposite direction. Concerned about the party’s declining authority, he has imposed an increasingly totalitarian system—one which Mao likely would admire, especially its technological innovations. Among its fearsome features: forcing a million or more Muslim Uighurs into reeducation camps, crushing the slightest public hint of dissent, and imposing a “social credit” system designed to regulate all personal behavior.



At the same time, the economic relationship with America is foundering. While it should surprise no one that authoritarian Beijing subsidizes and manages its industries, the PRC also has engaged in commercial espionage, tolerated the widespread theft of intellectual property and discriminated against U.S. firms. Companies which missed the promised bounty from Chinese investment now applaud the Trump administration’s trade war or abandon the Chinese market altogether.



China poses a challenge—serious, but not overwhelming. This warrants a proportional response: tough, but not panicked.



The PRC also has grown more aggressive internationally. Although Beijing does not threaten fundamental American security—no one imagines a Chinese assault on the U.S. homeland—it is mounting a significantly greater challenge to American influence in East Asia. China is creating a military capable of challenging Washington’s traditional dominance of East Asia up to the PRC’s borders. Beijing has taken an increasingly assertive position toward its neighbors over territorial disputes, more ruthlessly sought to increase its power over Taiwan and Hong Kong, and launched the “Belt and Road” initiative to gain economic clout and create potential military bases around the world. The PRC also has moved closer to Russia to counter Washington.



The result is a growing perception of “The China Threat.” The Cold War yielded a political consensus that the Soviet Union posed a serious danger that had to be contained. Republicans and Democrats often disagreed over policy details, but joined to support alliances such as NATO, fight wars including Korea and Vietnam, and oppose Soviet‐​backed insurgencies and governments throughout the Third World.



The Soviet collapse yielded a world in which America had no peer competitor. Even as the PRC grew economically, most Americans perceived little threat. For years Beijing emphasized its “peaceful rise” and its military power remained modest at best. Both of those factors have changed, however. Concern increasingly has turned into fear, stoked by President Donald Trump’s rhetoric and trade war.



Serious voices now advocate treating Beijing as an enemy, or something very close. A tone of regret has emerged at having allowed China into the World Trade Organization and developed a close commercial relationship with the PRC. The result, it is increasingly suggested, is aiding a dangerous authoritarian state that is fundamentally hostile to American interests and principles.



Some policymakers therefore seem determined to make up for lost time by challenging China. The president’s trade war has moved beyond a simple economic dispute. The president ordered by tweet—whether he was serious is tough to assess—all American companies to leave the PRC. Some legislators advocate sanctions for a range of perceived offenses, from security clashes to human rights violations. A number of conservatives even advocate breaking the economic relationship to weaken China.



Not quite a declaration of war, such a policy undoubtedly would be perceived as hostile and threatening in Beijing. The result would be a rapidly deteriorating relationship, far more contentious in political and military matters. Treating the PRC as an enemy would do much to turn it into an enemy. This strategy could be justified only as a last resort, with no realistic chance for a peaceful, cooperative relationship.



Yet despite governmental tensions, the two countries remain close. Hundreds of thousands of Chinese students are studying in America. Millions of tourists go in both directions. Academic exchanges, though complicated by visa requirements and other restrictions on both sides, continue. Extensive commerce, though battered by trade restrictions, persists. Despite the president’s edict via tweet, most U.S. firms have not run for the exit. Members of the two nations’ militaries meet.



Chinese communism is practical, cynical, even fraudulent. With capitalists joining the party, wealth accumulating, foreign firms driving growth, and government officials focusing on power preservation, the CCP looks far closer to fascism than communism. The U.S.-PRC trade spat is more mercantilism than ideology. This is very different from the Cold War. Thus, America’s response should be different than during the Cold War.



The PRC faces serious challenges: slowing growth in a debt‐​heavy economy, demographic disaster with an aging population, social divisions exacerbated by regional inequities, burgeoning trade war undertaken by the world’s largest economy, costly consumer and business failures resulting from pervasive corruption and fraud, rising dissatisfaction among partners with Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative, and growing international challenges from countries and territories spanning Asia to Europe. Even Chinese officials have been surprised at the breadth of the hostile response to Chinese policy, complaining of China‐​bashing. The PRC is likely to be a great and, eventually, perhaps, the greatest power. However, the path ahead is likely to be rough and Beijing’s future is not assured.



Finally, the PRC is not irredeemably “lost,” in the sense of being hostile, totalitarian, and threatening. We do not know that nation’s future. _Economist_ and Bloomberg columnist Tyler Cowen pointed to a long list of past erroneous predictions about China’s course, citing the saying “China will always surprise us.”



Indeed, evaluating the PRC requires asking “compared to what?” From 1949 through around 1976 under Mao, China was a humanitarian hellhole. Immediately after the revolution came brutal political, economic and social upheaval, highlighted by a tsunami of punishments, reprisals and executions. The Great Leap Forward was a national jump into the abyss, with mass starvation and death. Then the Cultural Revolution mixed purge, feud and civil war. All along the Chinese people suffered under an idiotic collectivist economic ideology that failed in practice everywhere.



This world, thankfully, is gone. The PRC that emerged from the reform process after roughly thirty‐​five years was vastly different. While not a free society, its people were much freer. And there was good reason to hope for a reemergence of the liberalism that was sidelined after the slaughter in Tiananmen Square.



Alas, this world also has disappeared. And almost entirely at the hands of one man: Xi Jinping.



He has been extraordinarily effective in extending his authority. However, his ascent up the mountaintop has left him at the precipice. His enemies are legion; anyone purged or punished, or associated with his predecessors, would like to take revenge. By dismantling presidential term limits Xi has inflamed fears he will become another Mao. Evident is high level discontent with his approach to the trade war and contentious territorial policies in the Asia‐​Pacific. There also is a popular opposition, obviously difficult to measure, to increased censorship, religious persecution, NGO closures, abuses of power and other human rights violations.



Finally, if Xi could turn the system one way, his successors could go in another. That he feels it necessary to push repression so far demonstrates the limits on support for his hardline position. There is nothing certain or predetermined about the PRC’s future course.



It is worth remembering that on January 1, 1989, few of even the most experienced European analysts imagined that, by December 31, the entire Soviet empire in Europe would have collapsed. It was a time of shock and awe at the unexpected end of what Ronald Reagan accurately called an “evil empire.” In another couple of years the Soviet Union would be gone. The USSR and its satellites had obvious weaknesses, but the authoritarian systems had deployed more than enough weapons of repression and tyranny to survive for decades. Those standing for freedom appeared to face overwhelming odds. Serious popular challenges were crushed by overwhelming force: Poland in 1953, Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, Poland in 1981. Mikhail Gorbachev’s rise gave hope of reform to the West, but no one expected his nation’s dissolution. We should not presume the future.



Moreover, the PRC already is being forced to adapt. For instance, Xi’s aggressive foreign policy has been surprisingly maladroit, driving East Asian nations toward not just America but India and Japan. Taiwan probably always was lost to China, but the latter’s unremitting repression has dramatically widened the gulf. The only option, military action, would create extraordinary blowback. Beijing’s determination to rule has sparked mass demonstrations against CCP control in Hong Kong. Those who know China the best most decisively reject its professed affections.



On the economic front, a number of American companies have begun planning to diversify their supply chains, shifting operations out of China. Even Apple reportedly is considering moving between 15 percent and 30 percent of production to Southeast Asia, which has become a lower‐​cost alternative to China. Few firms seem inclined to follow the president’s directive to divest, but future growth will be more constrained. Especially with rising salaries in China, which also have sent companies in search of more competitive labor supplies. A U.S.-China Business Council survey found that reasons for such shifts in addition to rising costs include trade tensions, anti‐​American political climate, limits on market access, domestic competition and better alternatives elsewhere.



Beijing poses a serious challenge to American values and interests. However, it is not an enemy. It is not unbeatable. And its future is not certain. Isolation and confrontation would be a foolish response, ensuring the PRC’s hostility, and that of the Chinese people.



The foundation of U.S. policy should remain engagement, though with more nuanced expectations. Washington must not forget that the competition between the PRC and the United States is primarily political, not military. In that fight, America should use all the advantages which flow to a free society. Washington should choose policies likely to exacerbate China’s internal contradictions and encourage pressure for liberal change.



For instance, policymakers should encourage forces that naturally constrain Chinese behavior and change Chinese objectives. Breaching the Great Firewall should be a priority. Accepting more Chinese students into American universities. Welcoming academic exchanges. Beckoning tourists. Pushing economic reform in China—and at home.



On the political/​security side, the United States should step back to force allied states to cooperate and create the same kind of deterrence against Chinese aggression as Beijing is attempting to establish against American intervention. U.S. officials should work with Asian and European allies and friends to develop policies designed to constrain (rather than contain) China. That effort should include making compromises necessary to settle disputes with Russia and draw it Westward.



While no one should underestimate the challenge posed by Beijing, it also would be a mistake to overstate it. America should adjust its perspective toward China once again. That nation poses a challenge—serious, but not overwhelming. Which warrants a proportional response: tough, but not panicked.

"**The Australian government has unveiled its plan to force tech giants such as Google and Facebook to pay news outlets for their content.**
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ""world-leading"" draft code of conduct aimed to give publishers ""a level playing field to ensure a fair go"".
Many news outlets have shut or shed jobs this year amid falling profits.
Facebook and Google strongly oppose the proposal, even suggesting they could walk away from Australia's news market.
Mr Frydenberg said the code of conduct - drafted by Australia's competition regulator - would be debated by parliament.
It could impose ""substantial penalties"" worth hundreds of millions of dollars on tech companies which fail to comply, he said.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission draft calls on tech companies to pay for content, though it does define what it is worth.
It would allow news companies to negotiate as a bloc with tech giants for content which appears in their news feeds and search results.
If negotiations fail, the matter could be arbitrated by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.
The draft code covers other matters too, including notifying news companies of changes to algorithms.
Penalties could be up to A$10m (Â£5m; $7m) per breach, or 10% of the company's local turnover.
The code will initially focus on Google and Facebook but could be expanded to other tech companies, the treasurer said.
Mr Frydenberg said: ""Nothing less than the future of the Australian media landscape is at stake with these changes.""
""Today's draft legislation will draw the attention of many regulatory agencies and many governments around the world,"" he said.
Australia's biggest media companies have lobbied hard for the proposal.
It was a ""watershed moment"" in efforts to end ""free-riding"" by the tech companies, News Corp Australia executive chairman Michael Miller said on Friday.
Google's local managing director, Mel Silva, said the company was ""deeply disappointed"" and argued the move would discourage innovation.
""The government's heavy-handed intervention threatens to impede Australia's digital economy and impacts the services we can deliver to Australians,"" she said.
Facebook has previously suggested it could remove Australian news from its platform if such requirements were imposed - arguing the cost to its business would be negligible.
The code of conduct will be subject to a month-long consultation period before being debated in parliament ""shortly after"" August, Mr Frydenberg said.
If legislation is passed, the code is designed to be reviewed after a year."
"**Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, Google and Telegram have all said they are ""pausing"" co-operation with requests for user information from the Hong Kong police.**
Several countries have criticised China for imposing a new security law, which they say threatens the territory's long-standing autonomy.
The announcements are likely to put pressure on Apple to do likewise.
While the others' services are blocked in mainland China, Apple's are not.
However, Facebook, Google and Twitter do generate revenue from selling advertising to Chinese clients.
Apple complied with the majority of requests it received from Hong Kong's government between January and June, before the new law came into effect, according to the firm's latest transparency report.
Microsoft - which has also previously handed over data about its users to Hong Kong's authorities, and maintains a significant presence in mainland China - has not announced a change in policy either.
The BBC has asked the two companies for comment.
Chat app Telegram - headquartered in London - was first to announce plans to halt co-operation.
""We understand the right of privacy of our Hong Kong users,"" the firm told the Hong Kong Free Press on Sunday.
""Accordingly, Telegram does not intend to process any data requests related to its Hong Kong users until an international consensus is reached in relation to the ongoing political changes in the city.""
Facebook followed saying it would stop considering the requests, ""pending further assessment"" of the human rights issues.
No personal information about users in the region was held at, or disclosed from, its Hong Kong office, it added.
""We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions,"" Facebook said.
WhatsApp - which is owned by Facebook - said it ""believes in the right for people to have a private conversation online"" and ""we remain committed to providing private and secure messaging services to our users in Hong Kong"".
Both platforms are blocked in mainland China but have benefited from Hong Kong's much broader access to the internet under its freedoms as a special administrative region.
Google said it paused production on any new data requests when the new rules came into effect last week.
""We'll continue to review the details of the new law,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC.
Twitter said it acted likewise.
WhatsApp has end-to-end encryption enabled by default - so it cannot read, or share with police officers, messages sent between two users.
On Facebook Messenger, however, encryption is not the default option - it has to be manually switched on by users.
Both platforms say they may disclose user data, in accordance with the law of the country in question.
But WhatsApp adds successful requests for this information must meet ""internationally recognised standards including human rights, due process, and the rule of law"".
In the US, both platforms require a subpoena to provide ""basic subscriber records"" such as the person's name, IP (internet protocol) address and email address.
Extra information about the subscriber may require a court order.
And a search warrant is needed for account contents:
Hong Kong, formerly a British territory, was handed back to China in 1997, on the condition it would enjoy special freedoms for 50 years.
The UK says China has now broken that agreement and is offering citizenship to as many as three million Hong Kong residents.
Meanwhile, the United States - where most of the tech firms involved are headquartered - is considering whether to remove Hong Kong's favourable trading terms.
The security laws introduce new crimes, including conspiring with foreigners to provoke ""hatred"" of the Chinese government or Hong Kong authorities, with penalties of up to life in prison.
As soon as they came into effect, senior members of pro-democracy groups quit, fearing prosecution.
And books written by pro-democracy activists have been removed from libraries."

From the University of Toronto:
Search for life on exoplanets more difficult than thought
A new study from the University of Toronto Scarborough suggests the search for life on planets outside our solar system may be more difficult than previously thought.
The study, authored by a team of international researchers led by UTSC Assistant Professor Hanno Rein from the Department of Physical and Environmental Science, finds the method used to detect biosignatures on such planets, known as exoplanets, can produce a false positive result.  
The presence of multiple chemicals such as methane and oxygen in an exoplanet’s atmosphere is considered an example of a biosignature, or evidence of past or present life. Rein’s team discovered that a lifeless planet with a lifeless moon can mimic the same results as a planet with a biosignature.
“You wouldn’t be able to distinguish between them because they are so far away that you would see both in one spectrum,” says Rein.
The resolution needed to properly identify a genuine biosignature from a false positive would be impossible to obtain even with telescopes available in the foreseeable future, says Rein.
“A telescope would need to be unrealistically large, something one hundred metres in size and it would have to be built in space,” he says. “This telescope does not exist, and there are no plans to build one any time soon.”
Current methods can estimate the size and temperature of an exoplanet planet in order to determine whether liquid water could exist on the planet’s surface, believed to be one of the criteria for a planet hosting the right conditions for life.
While many researchers use modeling to imagine the atmosphere of these planets, they still aren’t able to make conclusive observations, says Rein. “We can’t get an idea of what the atmosphere is actually like, not with the methods we have at our disposal.”
There are 1,774 confirmed exoplanets known to exist, but there could be more than 100 billion planets in the Milky Way Galaxy alone. Despite the results, Rein is optimistic the search for life on planets outside our own is possible if done the right way.
“We should make sure we are looking at the right objects,” he says, adding that the search for life within our solar system should remain a priority. He points to the recent discovery of a liquid ocean on Enceladus, one of Saturn’s larger moons, as a prime example.
“As for exoplanets we want to broaden the search and study planets around stars that are cooler and fainter than our own Sun. One example is the recently discovered planet Kepler-186f, which is orbiting an M-dwarf star,” says Rein.
Rein says locating a planet in a habitable zone while being able to obtain a good resolution to model the atmosphere will help determine what’s on the planet.
“There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic that we will find hints of extraterrestrial life within the next few decades, just maybe not on an Earth-like planet around a Sun-like star.”

While we’ve known about this for quite some time at WUWT, going back to August 2013, the story is now starting to make the rounds in the MSM.
And, NASA has created a cool visualization of the event. Video follows. From the NASA video description:
This visualization shows the position of the sun’s magnetic fields from January 1997 to December 2013. The field lines swarm with activity: The magenta lines show where the sun’s overall field is negative and the green lines show where it is positive. A region with more electrons is negative, the region with less is labeled positive. Additional gray lines represent areas of local magnetic variation.

The entire sun’s magnetic polarity, flips approximately every 11 years — though sometimes it takes quite a bit longer — and defines what’s known as the solar cycle. The visualization shows how in 1997, the sun shows the positive polarity on the top, and the negative polarity on the bottom. Over the next 12 years, each set of lines is seen to creep toward the opposite pole eventually showing a complete flip. By the end of the movie, each set of lines are working their way back to show a positive polarity on the top to complete the full 22 year magnetic solar cycle.
At the height of each magnetic flip, the sun goes through periods of more solar activity, during which there are more sunspots, and more eruptive events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. The point in time with the most sunspots is called solar maximum.

"Why is the sea salty? – Torben, aged nine, Sussex, UK. Two-thirds of the Earth’s surface is covered in water, and 97% of that is salty seawater. Only 3% of our planet’s water is fresh, and 2% is trapped, frozen in ice caps, glaciers and soils. That leaves less than 1% as fresh, liquid water in rivers, lakes and streams – and this fresh water plays a big role in explaining why the sea is salty.  Water moves around our planet in a cycle powered by the sun: from the sea, to the sky, to the land and then back to the sea. When the sun heats the water in the sea, it changes into a gas called “water vapour” and rises into the air, through a process called “evaporation”.   Curious Kids is a series by The Conversation, which gives children the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. If you have a question you’d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskids@theconversation.com. We won’t be able to answer every question, but we’ll do our very best. While floating in the air, the water vapour cools off and turns back into liquid water, forming clouds (through a process called “condensation”). This water eventually falls from the clouds in the sky as rain, sleet, hail or snow (that’s called “precipitation”).  When precipitation falls on land, the water flows into streams and rivers, and eventually makes its way back out to the sea. Then the sun heats the sea water and the cycle starts all over again.  You’re probably still wondering where the salt comes in. Well, the rain that falls from the sky is not just pure water – it actually contains small amounts of chemicals called carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide, which are absorbed by the water while it is still in the air.  This means that rain is actually very slightly acidic (but not enough to do you any harm). When the rain falls on the ground, this weak acid can dissolve small amounts of mineral salts from the rocks, including sodium and chloride, which then enter the water. Sodium chloride is the main salt in seawater, and the same one you might have on your table at home. The rain water flows off the land and into the rivers and streams that lead all the way to the sea – carrying the dissolved salts along with it.  But if the rivers and streams are carrying these dissolved salts, then why aren’t they as salty as the sea? In fact, they’re only carrying very low levels of these salts. The salts in the seas have built up over billions of years, and seawater contains about 300 times more dissolved salts than average river water.  To put it another way, every one litre of seawater has 35 grams of salts dissolved in it, while a litre of freshwater would only have 0.5 grams. That’s why we say that seawater has a much higher concentration of salt – or “salinity” – than the freshwater flowing through rivers and streams.  Some salts can also enter the seas from hot vents on the deep ocean floor and from volcanoes on the land and in the sea. Some salts (particularly chloride) are also moved around as part of the water cycle – these are known as “cyclic salts” and originally came from volcanoes.  Since salt is always flowing from the land to the sea, you might think the sea is getting saltier. But actually, some of this salt is removed by algae and animals that live in the sea, and some is deposited as sediment on the bottom of the ocean. So the salt going into the sea keeps a balance with the salt being deposited or removed.  The salinity of the sea isn’t the same everywhere. In warmer, tropical areas, more evaporation occurs, so the water is saltier. Towards the north and south poles, the seawater is diluted by melting ice, so the water is not so salty. This is natural.  But these differences in salinity might get bigger in the future, because of climate change. Warmer climates may lead to more rain and melting ice in the northern hemisphere, and more evaporation in the southern hemisphere, which could change the saltiness of our seas.  The saltier that water is, the more dense (or heavier) it becomes. Along with warmer temperatures, this could affect how water moves around in the oceans, which could affect all life on our planet – not just the creatures living in the sea.  This article has been updated to reflect the fact that sodium and chloride ions separate out when dissolved in water. Children can have their own questions answered by experts – just send them in to Curious Kids, along with the child’s first name, age and town or city. You can: Here are some more Curious Kids articles, written by academic experts: Why does the light turn on? – Ben, aged three, UK.

 During lockdown, the wild grass in Bristol’s Greenbank cemetery has grown higher than many of the tombstones, transforming the land above the dead into a gothic meadow. Nominally closed to the public before 4pm each day, the grounds are a popular location for joggers, strollers and dog walkers, who enter through a gap in the fence. For Zakiya Mckenzie, a local writer, this is the furthest from home she has been in three months, but she has chosen this spot for an interview because of its historic symbolism – a subject that has has come to the fore like never before in the wake of the pandemic. She leads me down wooded slopes to a waist-high monument set in a glade, a little apart from the other tombs. It is the relocated grave of a group of Baptist people, including Fanny Coker, who was born a slave in the Caribbean island of Nevis in 1767 and died in Bristol in 1820, serving as a housemaid to one of Bristol’s wealthiest plantation-owning families. Simple, secluded and shared, the stone could hardly be more different from the elaborate statue of the slave trader Edward Colston, which held pride of place in the centre of Bristol until last month, when it was pulled down by Black Lives Matter activists and thrown into the harbour. For Mckenzie, this is part of an overdue reconsideration of the wealthy, predominantly white world’s mistreatment of other people and the environment. “This is the perfect time to discuss land and history. A lot of people are upset that Colston’s statue has been pulled down. We must discuss why,” she says. Since 2016, Mckenzie has been working as part of the Black and Green Ambassador project that aims to address the exclusion of black, working class and immigrant communities from the largely white, middle class environmental movement. She has focused on nature walks, field trips and discussions on the Ujima community radio station, while also encouraging green groups to make more space and time for different voices and a greater understanding of the global, structural cause of the climate, nature, health and inequality crises. In the wake of the lockdown there is strong public support for a fundamental rethink. A substantial majority want big or moderate changes in the way the economy is run, while only 6% are opposed to change, according to a recent YouGov survey. Prominent figures from business, unions, the bureaucracy and the church have echoed the need for a “fairer and greener” rebuilding. While there is scant recognition of the need for environmental justice at the national government level, communities have proved more adept at linking global environmental concerns with local social inequalities. Bristol has been at the centre of both the problem and the search for solutions. In the early 18th century, this city in south-west England profited from the slave trade and monoculture plantations more than anywhere else in the UK. Over centuries, the city’s merchants financed more than 2,000 voyages on a triangular trade route: first taking British manufactured goods to Africa, then cramming the hold with slaves for transport to plantations in the West Indies, and finally returning with sugar cane and cotton. The human and environmental toll continues to be felt today, but Bristol is also going further than most in trying to address the consequences. This was the first major city in Europe to directly elect a black mayor, the first in the world to declare a climate emergency and the first in the UK to be named a European green capital.  There has been tension between largely white, middle class environmental activists who say the climate should come before all else, and black and working class communities who are more focused on day-to-day economic inequality. But the mayor, Marvin Rees, says the ultimate goals are aligned. “These are not separate agendas,” he said. “The climate is an issue of social justice. People hit first and hardest by the destruction of the planet look like me and my father.” Bristol has promised to go carbon neutral by 2030, which is the most ambitious target of any city in the country and 20 years ahead of the national government, but even before the pandemic it was off-track, and the lockdown has punched an £80m hole in the city’s revenues from council tax and business rates. Rees said he would be looking for savings from climate interventions and flood defences rather than frontline services, such as care homes and refuse collection. This triage of today’s crisis over tomorrow’s was reluctant. Rees wants the central government to intervene by front-loading planned investments in retrofitting homes, public transport and decarbonising the energy system. The focus, he said, should be on creating jobs in the transition to clean energy. “There is no doubt the next shock will be the climate shock. We can’t get away from that,” he said. “But we need to remember the green economy is also about housing quality, not just wind farms.” Nobody needs to tell that to the working class community of Lawrence Weston. This post-war housing estate in north-west Bristol is one of the lowest income neighbourhoods in the UK, but it has also gone further than most in marrying local social concerns with climate strategy. This is thanks to a strong community spirit, a supportive council and a nimbleness in adapting to crises. During the depths of austerity in 2012, the city threatened to close the local youth centre, so a group of residents took over the building and made it a community hub for debt advice, mental health counselling, veterinary advice, craft workshops and classes for zumba and kickboxing. During lockdown, they have repurposed the building once again as a distribution hub for food parcels and prescription deliveries. Mark Pepper, a lifelong resident who works full-time as the project development manager of Ambition Lawrence Weston, said the lockdown had strengthened the community and made people more determined to push ahead with infrastructure projects that could make them more resilient to future shocks. He says residents realise they can make money and save the planet at the same time. Helped by donors, including a lottery-funded Big Local budget and a 50% share in the profits of a solar power plant, they have hired specialist consultants to help them draw up an ambitious community action plan to build affordable, environmentally friendly housing, install new charging points for electric cars and improve cycle access. Residents – 70% of whom say they struggle to pay heating and electricity bills – can use a mobile phone app that employs thermal imaging to spot weaknesses in the energy efficiency of their homes. Local traders then fix the draughty windows and insulate the lofts, but only charge a fee to those who can afford it. “We’re doing a lot on climate, but only by accident,” Pepper says. “We used to think the climate was a middle class problem, that had nothing to do with us because we have low car ownership and few people take foreign holidays. Our residents have more pressing worries like paying the rent, heating their homes and buying enough food for their families.” But they now see it as a way of investing in the future. Later this month, Pepper – who left school with no qualifications – is expecting a response to the community’s proposal to build a £5.4m wind turbine. The planned 4.5MW tower would be erected 3km from Lawrence Weston and generate enough electricity to power 3,850 homes and generate an income for the community of between £50,000 and £400,000 a year depending on borrowing costs. “We want an economic return as well as a reduced carbon footprint. We’ll use the cash for a training academy so that residents can get good jobs in renewable technology, energy efficiency and passive building construction,” Pepper says. For him, this is a question of independence. “We hope that after Covid there is more recognition for grass-roots social infrastructure that enables us to help ourselves more,” he said. Encouraging more collective ownership may seem a thousand miles away from the government’s policies, but many believe this is key to engaging a wider community to reduce emissions, care for nature, and address prejudice and inequality. Other countries have demonstrated that this coming together of people, energy and land does not need to be a distant utopia. In Germany, nearly half of renewable energy is cooperatively owned, in France more than half the agriculture market is farmer cooperative owned, compared with 6% in the UK, and in the global south, communal forest management is more effective at carbon sequestration than government-run programmes. The poet Mckenzie is optimistic this crisis will open doors and strengthen communities. The felling of the Colston statue has inspired her to start writing again, after being blocked for the first couple of months of lockdown. She is venturing out further physically and moving campaign activities online, which makes them more accessible. The Black and Green Ambassadors project has also received a grant from the national lottery to recruit three new ambassadors and a full-time administrator. “It’s very exciting. This is our baby,” Mckenzie says. She also plans to promote the idea that well-being needs to be made more of a priority than economic growth. “The pandemic has made us realise the importance of essential workers and nature. We’re all interconnected,” she said. “We can’t just go back to business as usual. That would be to the detriment of everyone.”"

Press Release: **ACT Party**



“National’s support for the Government’s flawed Zero Carbon Bill and its opposition to ACT’s attempts to improve the legislation are deeply disappointing”, ACT Leader David Seymour says.



“The Zero Carbon Bill requires that emissions offsets take place only in New Zealand. The [New Zealand Initiative says](https://nzinitiative.org.nz/reports-and-media/reports/real-action-not-empty-words-how-to-make-the-zero-carbon-bill-about-cutting-emissions/) this requirement will add $300 billion to our emissions bill, reduce national income by 6 per cent, and lead to higher emissions. It has called the Bill **the most expensive piece of legislation in New Zealand’s history.**



“Yesterday, ACT proposed an amendment which would have allowed New Zealanders to achieve emissions reductions at the lowest possible cost by purchasing overseas units as well as domestic units. It shouldn’t matter if trees are planted in Northland or in the Amazon. The requirement for emissions to be offset using only domestic units will have a significant impact on the cost of living, including higher fuel and food costs.



“The Zero Carbon Bill also gives the Climate Change Minister **unconstrained power over the New Zealand economy.** The Minister must plan how and where emissions will be reduced, in every sector of the economy, and this plan can be changed any time. This is **Muldoonism in environmental drag.**



“It is deeply unfortunate that National voted against ACT’s amendments to improve the legislation.



“As on the issues of freedom of expression and firearms legislation, **ACT has been the lone voice of opposition to the Labour Government.** In Red October last year, National voted with Labour on market studies, equal pay and child poverty legislation, with ACT voting against the entire Parliament.



“Ultimately, the Zero Carbon Bill is more about fundamentally transforming the economy and the way we live than it is about effectively reducing emissions.



“ACT could have supported a bill that allowed New Zealanders to reduce their emissions at least cost with minimal bureaucracy, but this legislation means **expensive reductions with maximum bureaucracy.**



“We have made genuine attempts to improve the Zero Carbon Bill, but we cannot support such flawed legislation.”

"**TikTok has launched a direct attack on Facebook, accusing it of being a ""copycat"" and trying to end TikTok's presence in the US under the guise of patriotism.**
It comes as TikTok, owned by Chinese firm ByteDance, faces fresh scrutiny.
US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said TikTok was now being reviewed over national security concerns.
Meanwhile, Facebook and other big tech firms are due to defend their practices in front of the US Congress.
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg will join Sundar Pichai from Google, Apple's Tim Cook and Amazon's Jeff Bezos to answer questions from politicians on Wednesday.
TikTok has long battled allegations that it is too close to the Chinese state - something it fiercely denies.
Announcing the review, Secretary Mnuchin said TikTok was being investigated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which examines commercial transactions for national security concerns.
He did not say if it was linked to ByteDance's purchase of the Musical.ly app, which Reuters previously reported was being looked at by CFIUS.
A recommendation would be made to President Donald Trump this week, he said. Mr Trump separately said that his administration was ""thinking about"" making a decision on the app later this week.
It came shortly after TikTok published a firmly worded defence of its role in the United States.
Chief executive Kevin Mayer said that while big firms ""rightly"" come under scrutiny, ""we have received even moreâ¦ due to the company's Chinese origins"".
He went on: ""TikTok has become the latest target, but we are not the enemy"".
He also took direct aim at Facebook, writing off its new Instagram Reels feature as a TikTok clone.
Much like Tiktok, the app is focused on short-form ephemeral video.
""Facebook is even launching another copycat product, Reels (tied to Instagram), after their other copycat Lasso failed quickly,"" Mr Meyer's statement said.
Lasso had been referred to as ""a TikTok clone"" by media outlets for its similarities, but was shut down in July.
Mr Meyer also defended the cultural impact of TikTok, and warned that without his firm, American advertisers would be left with fewer options.
A repeated theme was that TikTok was good for competition. Without it, he wrote, ""competition would dry up and so too will an outlet for America's creative energy"".
He also insisted the company had no political leanings or agenda.
This is not the first time TikTok has faced trouble. It was recently banned in India amid heightened tensions between that country and China.
A lawsuit filed in December alleged that TikTok sent ""vast quantities"" of user data back to mainland China - something the company denies.
US politicians have frequently criticised the social network, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warning it may be banned.
When asked if he would recommend downloading it, he replied: ""Only if you want your private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is defined as the variability of the North Atlantic sea surface temperature compared to the rest of the global ocean from 60°N to 60°S once trends are removed. The AMO high is usually seen off eastern Canada and north and east of Iceland. The AMO low has the pattern reversed. Compare those areas in Figure 1 with Figure 3.
The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is defined as the difference between the Northwest Pacific surface and the eastern Pacific surface temperature north of the equator. Figure 1 and figure 2 show the two phases. Both the PDO and the AMO affect the weather in the Northern Hemisphere. Both show up distinctly on anomaly maps. The GISS anomaly map found here was used to produce these figures.
There are four ways these patterns can interact. Each of these four ways result in distinctly different patterns. Beginning with the most recent pattern, from last February, that buried New England in snow, when both the AMO and the PDO were high.

In Figure 1, the western Pacific north of 20°N is cool, and the eastern pacific off the West Coast of the U. S. is warm. This makes the Western U. S. very warm. The jet stream has a huge loop diversion north past Alaska and south over the eastern U. S. all the way to Florida. This is the pattern when both AMO and PDO are high.
In contrast in November 2011, when AMO was high and PDO was low, the pattern changes to Figure 2.

In Figure 2, note that the Pacific temperatures are now reversed, the western Pacific is warm and the eastern Pacific off the U. S. coast is cool. This reverses the continental pattern with the West cool and the East warm. Note that the pattern over Europe and Asia is also reversed. This pattern filled the California reservoirs and buried Alaska in snow.
Figure 3 is the pattern when PDO and AMO are both low.

In Figure 3, both patterns were very low. Temperatures were very low over the entire Arctic and most of Canada and the northern U. S. This was during the ice age scare of the 1970s.

Figure 4 illustrates the conditions just ten years later in February of 1981. PDO was high and AMO was still low. The western U. S. and all of Canada was warm and Europe was cool. Each land mass is responding to the adjacent sea temperature.
These cycles affect the food chain as well as the weather. Salmon stocks in the Pacific North-west rise during the cool phase of the PDO, and fall during the warm phase. In  similar fashion, Atlantic Salmon stocks follow the AMO, rising when the AMO is cool and falling when it is warm.
The recent spike in the PDO is temporary. The warm “blob” off the U. S. west coast will move south with the North Pacific/Japan/Kuroshio/California Current and be replaced by the cooler water behind it. The peak was reached in December and has fallen since then (as of March). The PDO data is available here. AMO data is available from NOAA, here.
As both the AMO and PDO affect Northern Hemisphere temperatures, and extremes are reached when both are in the same phase, it does make sense to combine them as I did in my last post on What Caused the Pause or Why Hate The Hiatus?
These cycles are weather. They can also be called natural climate cycles. They have nothing to do with CO2, and everything to do with driving many of the climate features that are gleefully pointed by climate alarmists. They determine the snowstorms, heat waves, floods and droughts pointed out by the alarmists as indications of “Climate Change”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThis past weekend I wrote two posts about a recent two-part German ZDF Television documentary on climate change and its impact on the development of human history: here and here.

Image Mark Maslin, cropped from ZDF
At the very end of Part 2, the otherwise excellent German public television documentary abruptly descends into sheer lunacy in claiming that the globe has “strongly heated up” recently and that it is now wresting with “global warming” – and to drive the point home, it inserts an amazing comment by University College London Climatology Professor Mark Maslin at the 42:27 mark (translated from the German voice-over):
We are now at the point where we can decide how the climate of the future will look. When we as a collective world community, all nations working together, are able to really prevent global warming, that would be fantastic. That would be the first time that the climate doesn’t control us, but rather us controlling it. We could make sure that all future generations will have a stable climate.”
Maslin clearly suggests humans collectively have the power to override the global natural climate factors and to tame and steer the world’s climate in any desired direction, and to do so for “all future generations”.

Throughout previous 88 minutes the documentary looked at earlier climate changes that were greater than those experienced today and attributed them to natural factors such as solar activity, volcanoes and ocean dynamics. These natural climate change events included the “very rapid changes in climate” during the last ice age, the end of the last ice age, the 8.2 kiloyear event, the green Sahara, ancient Egyptian warm period, the Roman warm period, and the Little Ice Age.
Strangely, according to the documentary, the sun as a climate driver in the past seem to have just disappeared since 1250 AD. Now we are supposed to believe that humans took control of the climate some 100 years ago.
Physicist: “blatant silliness”
Luxemburg physicist Francis Massen also reacts sharply to Maslin’s bold claim at his website:
This is blatant silliness, probably forced upon the professor to include at least a sentence seen to be politically correct and Zeitgeist aware. This last conclusion is the more silly, as all previous examples clearly have shown that the changes of the climate were not caused by human activity. And today, never mind our technological achievements, we are still unable to change the tilt of the axis of the globe, modify solar activity or put a lid on volcanoes to avoid their eruptions.”
Indeed. In fact governments aren’t even able to control their runaway spending and deficits, let alone the world’s temperature and climate.

"Neal K. Katyal was for a time the top lawyer in the Obama administration. As acting solicitor general, he represented the government before the Supreme Court. He is no conservative, and says he is disappointed that the latest nominee to the court is from the White House of President Trump. Yet in the opinion pages of The New York Times on Tuesday, Katyal made a forceful case for Trump’s pick to the high court, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Katyal called the nominee a man of principle who will uphold the rule of law, and “bring a sense of fairness and decency to the job, and a temperament that suits the nation’s highest court. ” The author says he knows this because he has seen Gorsuch in action, both in court and through a federal rules committee on which they both serve. What Katyal did not mention  —   and the   page did not disclose in his bio  —   is that he has cases pending before the Supreme Court. Katyal was identified as a former solicitor general, a law professor at Georgetown University and a private litigator at the law firm Hogan Lovells. But in that last role he represents the giant drug manufacturer   Squibb, Indian tribes and numerous other clients with cases before the court. Some readers would have liked to know more about Katyal’s background. Here’s one email from Mithra Busler of Atlantic Highlands, N. J. I took this concern to both   page and to Katyal himself. Jim Dao, the   editor, said the editors had not been aware of Katyal’s cases before the court. Writers are required to disclose potential conflicts, he said, but the process got rushed in this case. “Editors do try to ask writers directly,” he said. “On tight deadlines  —   and the Katyal piece was done on tight deadline  —   the question doesn’t always get asked. So I don’t blame the writer or the editor in this case. ” When I reached out to Katyal, he said he had not received such a disclosure request and had not had a conversation about potential conflicts. He also thought it was obvious to The Times that as a lawyer whose practice often brings him to the Supreme Court, he would have a case before it. More critically, Katyal said, it is common for Supreme Court lawyers not to mention litigation they have pending before the court when writing an opinion piece about a nominee or speaking to a reporter. Here’s his response to me in full: The problem is that the   did not note that Katyal is among the elite lawyers who argue before the high court. Katyal, in his original submission to   editors, disclosed that he is a highly experienced litigator before the Supreme Court. The editors did not disclose that to readers. The Times editors’ lack of disclosure may leave Katyal open to unwarranted criticism, not only from readers but from others looking to challenge his motives. I’m not suggesting Katyal is currying favor with a man who is almost certainly going to be on the court. I seriously doubt that he is. Plus, given the range of his clients, some might benefit and others not if Gorsuch is even on the bench when their cases come up. But The Times opens itself up to that criticism by failing to simply tell the readers more about who he is. Katyal’s piece falls into an appealing category for an   editor: a partisan who breaks ranks to support the opposition. Whenever that happens, the author of the piece is bound to endure scrutiny by those who feel betrayed. Shouldn’t The Times err on the side of disclosure? It doesn’t need to be in   language that implies a grave conflict. I’m not suggesting that The Times should have listed every case Katyal has before the court. But at minimum, readers in this case deserve to know that he is a Supreme Court litigator with cases before the court. Let the readers decide if that matters, or indeed whether it might even enhance the author’s expertise. Updated 7:30 a. m. February 4, to clarify that it was The Times, not Katyal, that failed to disclose his litigating experience. I intended from the start to convey that this was The Times’s failure and not Katyal’s. I regret the ambiguity surrounding the party responsible for failing to disclose Katyal’s experience and any misunderstanding caused by it."
"HOUSTON  —   In the   to Super Bowl LI on Sunday, politics has permeated the N. F. L. ’s shield to an unusual degree, with players, owners and even the league’s commissioner being asked about President Trump and his recent policy decisions. But in a news conference to discuss Sunday’s halftime show, Lady Gaga, one of the most outspoken pop stars and a vocal critic of the president, remained coy when asked if her performance would include any strong political statements. “The only statements that I’ll be making during the halftime show are the ones that I’ve been consistently making throughout my career,” Lady Gaga said. “I believe in a passion for inclusion. I believe in the spirit of equality, and that the spirit of this country is one of love and compassion and kindness. My performance will uphold those philosophies. ” She also did not divulge any details about what songs she would perform, what outfits she would wear, or if the bee emoji that she recently posted in a comment on Instagram was an indication that Beyoncé would be involved in her performance. But she did suggest the show would be one for her legions of fans who represent the margins of society. “That kid that couldn’t get a seat at the cool kids’ table, and that kid that was kicked out of the house because his mom and dad didn’t accept him for who he was?” Lady Gaga said. “That kid is going to have the stage for 13 minutes. And I’m excited to give it to them. ” She said the goal of the performance, which will include an introduction featuring her fans and her friend and frequent collaborator Tony Bennett, was to have a unifying message, but she understood that was a hard goal to achieve. “I don’t know if I will succeed in unifying America,” Lady Gaga said. “You’ll have to ask America when it’s over. ” Lady Gaga, 30, who was born Stefani Germanotta, has often seemed to seek out controversy, including stunts like wearing a dress made out of meat to the MTV Video Music Awards in 2010. She has embraced a persona as an outcast of sorts by labeling herself as Mother Monster and her fans as Little Monsters. But after criticizing Mr. Trump before the election, she has remained mostly quiet about him on social media since. On Twitter, where she speaks to an audience of more than 65 million people, she has shown support for the Women’s March on Washington and various other causes, but has not posted about Mr. Trump directly since Nov. 13. Considering her politically active nature and her vocal support of Hillary Clinton, Lady Gaga’s selection to perform at the halftime show was a somewhat atypical choice for the   N. F. L. Shortly after her selection, “Entertainment Tonight,” citing unnamed sources, claimed she would be prohibited from mentioning Mr. Trump during the performance, but in a statement at the time a representative for the league called that “nonsense. ” The history of the halftime show has been largely without controversy, progressing from marching bands to upbeat groups like Up With People and then safe pop acts like New Kids on the Block. The league was forced to try to mix things up when in 1992 the sketch show “In Living Color” staged an alternative halftime show on Fox that drew more than 20 million viewers and an estimated 10 rating points away from the official performance by Gloria Estefan at the game. The show’s   comedy appealed to younger viewers more than Ms. Estefan’s performance, in which she was joined by the figure skaters Brian Boitano and Dorothy Hamill. By 1993, the league had learned its lesson, and had Michael Jackson perform, and in the years that followed they had a string of other top performers including U2, Paul McCartney and Prince. While recent years have seen the league try to go for younger, possibly more relevant performers, the controversies have been few and far between. When the Red Hot Chili Peppers admitted to not having played their instruments live it qualified as a notable event. The one exception to the rule, of course, came in the halftime performance for Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, when Justin Timberlake infamously tore away part of Janet Jackson’s top, thus creating a new meaning for the term “wardrobe malfunction. ” It just so happens that the one controversial event happened at Reliant Stadium, which was renamed NRG Stadium in 2014 and will be the setting of Lady Gaga’s performance on Sunday. Lady Gaga insisted there would be no repeat of Ms. Jackson’s wardrobe malfunction, saying that everything would be “nice and tight,” but said she wanted to preserve the mystery of her performance. “There will be no meat dress there, so don’t wait for that,” Lady Gaga said. “Get excited to see something that you haven’t seen before. ”"

These are challenging times for the Fed and other central banks. Their credibility and effectiveness are being questioned and, most importantly, the case for their political independence is under scrutiny, if not outright attack. It would be convenient to believe that these threats are entirely external in nature. But, unfortunately, I believe some of the challenge stems from self‐​inflicted wounds that have enabled these threats to grow and even flourish. While the Fed cannot always control the external political environment in which it exists, it can, and should, seek to avoid undermining its own credibility and the case for its independence.



To some extent, the problems stem from two related trends, both of which the Fed (and other central banks) have often contributed— mission creep, accompanied by elevated expectations of the capabilities of monetary policy, and, more recently, the extensive use of unconventional monetary policies that broke the traditional boundaries separating monetary policy from fiscal policy. Indeed, beginning in 2009 and 2010, I spoke frequently about the dangers of the Fed’s unconventional policies and the risks they posed for the Fed’s credibility and its political independence (see Plosser 2009, 2010).



Political independence, of course, is widely viewed as an important pillar of sound monetary policy. The case for independence is largely an empirical one. History is replete with examples of undesirable outcomes when the monetary authorities become excessively politicized. While independence for the central bank is crucial, in a democracy, it must be accompanied by constraints on the breadth and use of its powers in order to ensure accountability.1 Thus, institutional arrangements and frameworks matter, including monetary policy strategies and operating regimes. The choice of such arrangements can act to support or undermine Fed independence.



These trends are not entirely new. For example, regarding mission creep and elevated expectations for monetary policy, I often point to Milton Friedman’s 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association where he said: “We are in danger of assigning to monetary policy a larger role than it can perform, in danger of asking it to accomplish tasks that it cannot achieve, and, as a result, in danger of preventing it from making the contributions it is capable of making” (Friedman 1968: 5).



Friedman’s warning was prescient. The 1970s saw an aggressive attempt by the Fed to influence and control the real economy, and unemployment more specifically, resulting in rising inflation rates that reached double digits. After Paul Volcker regained control of inflation in the early 1980s, monetary policymakers tended to exhibit more restraint toward the feasibility and effectiveness of stabilization policy, implicitly acknowledging Friedman’s wisdom. Unfortunately, with the financial crisis and subsequent recession, the Fed seems to have returned to the mistaken hubris of the 1960s, albeit dressed up in fancier models and calls for financial stability.



Thus, Friedman’s admonishment seems as relevant today as it was in 1967. We have asked more and more of our central banks and, in my view, they have too eagerly accepted responsibility for economic outcomes that, in some cases, exceed their mandates and, in other cases, lay beyond their capabilities. For example, we often hear pronouncements that monetary policy should seek to address weakness in real wage growth, or low labor force participation rates; the challenges of income inequality, climate change, or the prospects of future trade policy; and the list continues to grow. Yet monetary policy has limited ability to influence these challenges even though monetary policy may have to react to the economic consequences. The extent to which central bankers suggest monetary policy can or should seek to address these concerns fosters a mistaken view of the power of monetary policy and central banks. This broader scope for monetary policy invites politicization and undermines central bank credibility when it fails to achieve the desired results.



The adoption of unconventional monetary policy that sought to expand the reach and effectiveness of the Fed’s tools in order to influence and shape real economic outcomes sometimes broke the traditional boundaries that separated monetary from fiscal policy. One predictable consequence is increased political pressure on the Fed. Indeed, such actions amount to an open invitation to such pressure.



So, let me highlight in a little more detail how unconventional policy choices by the Fed have undermined its own credibility and its case for independence. First, let me say that to some extent, the Fed was under tremendous pressure to act during the financial crisis. It felt that it had no choice but to undertake many of these unconventional measures. Yet it was, in effect, placing big bets that the benefits would outweigh the costs. I think the jury is still out as to whether that assessment was the right one. Some of the extraordinary policies are now being viewed as less beneficial or effective than it was thought at the time (see, for example, Levin 2019), and the accompanying costs or unintended consequences that those actions brought about are only now beginning to manifest themselves.



Unconventional policies adopted by the Fed can be broken down into three interrelated buckets—first, the use of what was referred to as Section 13 (3) lending to rescue Bear Stearns and AIG; second, large‐​scale asset purchase programs to allocate credit across firms, sectors, and asset classes; and third, balance sheet expansion, or quantitative easing (QE), to provide additional monetary accommodation when the policy rate reached the zero lower bound. Accompanied by the authority gained in 2008 to pay interest on reserves, the large balance sheet has persuaded the Fed to adopt a new operating regime—one where the large size of the balance sheet is no longer constrained by monetary policy.



Section 13 (3) lending enabled the rescues of Bear Stearns and AIG. These creditor bailouts were overtly fiscal policy actions, placing taxpayer dollars at risk through the purchase of highly risky assets to support creditors of these failing firms. Such credit allocation decisions would normally be thought of as belonging to the fiscal authorities. These actions blurred the traditional boundary between monetary and fiscal policy.2 The ability and willingness of the Fed to conduct such fiscal actions did not go unnoticed. In December 2008, two senators wrote Chairman Bernanke to request that the Fed help rescue GM and other automobile companies. After all, weren’t these industrial giants as important to the economy as Bear Stearns and AIG? Bernanke said no to the request, but it proved a harbinger of things to come. Indeed, Congress and the public reacted to these bailouts and in the Dodd‐​Frank legislation Congress placed limits on the types of lending the Fed could do under Section 13 (3). Interestingly, in the same bill, Congress chose to fund a new agency (the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or CFPB) through the Fed. The irony of such contrasting actions is striking but foreshadowed an evolving trend toward the explicit use of the Fed’s balance sheet to fund fiscal initiatives.3



The large‐​scale asset purchase program also involved an important element of credit allocation. Each round involved significant purchases of mortgage‐​backed securities (MBS). This was explicitly intended to provide special support to the housing sector. Once again, such credit allocation policies are more appropriately thought of as fiscal policy. This effort to directly support housing through the purchase of MBS was a major departure from prior Fed practice. Previously, the Fed had almost exclusively bought and sold Treasury securities in order to remain as neutral as possible vis‐​à‐​vis credit allocation. Moreover, it generally, although not always, sought to match its holdings of Treasuries to the maturity structure of the outstanding government debt to avoid influencing the market‐​determined term structure.



Finally, the Fed has now adopted an operating regime for monetary policy commonly called a floor system. This system has several features, but a key element is that the Fed’s balance sheet is no longer tied to monetary policy.4 The primary instrument of monetary policy in a floor system is an administered rate, the interest paid on reserves (both excess and required). The balance sheet or the volume of reserves is not crucial to the setting of monetary policy as long as demand is satiated at the interest rate paid on reserves.



The rationale offered by the Fed for maintaining a large balance sheet, or as they refer to it, one with “ample reserves,” has focused on (1) simplicity and improved efficiency in the control of short‐​term interest rates, including a reduced necessity of actively managing the supply of reserves through interventions, and (2) improvements in financial stability and the increase in demand for reserves induced, in part, by new regulations such as the LCR (liquidity coverage ratio). My view is that this new operating regime is not as simple or as beneficial as advertised and political economy concerns pose risks to the Fed’s independence. More specifically, I argue that:



• Operational benefits are dubious;



• The role of the balance sheet in conducting monetary policy remains unclear;



• Important governance questions surrounding the operation of the system remain unresolved; and



• Political economy issues that put at risk Fed independence loom large for the institution.



So, let me briefly touch on each of these concerns.



The Fed has argued that the new system is simple and successful. This conclusion is far from obvious. From my perspective, it looks like a jerry‐​rigged apparatus held together with belts and suspenders. The floor system has a lot of moving parts. As currently implemented,



• It specifies a target band for the federal funds (ff) rate determined by the FOMC;



• It requires the Board of Governors (BoG), not the FOMC, to set the interest on reserves (IOR);



• It has required the development of a reverse repo program (RRP) to support the lower end of the ff band, as the IOR has proved to be a leaky floor, and it still requires interventions using standard repos to manage the balance sheet to ensure the upper end of the ff is maintained;



• Moreover, the Fed is pursuing new regulations to prevent a private bank from competing with the RRP by forcing it to accept a lower IOR than other banks.



Another argument for the floor or ample reserves regime is that maintaining a buffer of highly liquid reserves enhances financial stability. What evidence is there to support such a claim? Is the balance sheet now a tool of financial stability rather than monetary policy?



The creation of reserves involves the Fed purchasing Treasury securities in the open market and creating bank reserves. Why does substituting reserves for Treasuries increase liquidity or financial stability? Both are highly liquid and qualify in meeting the LCR. Moreover, only banks can hold reserves while Treasuries can be held by a broader range of financial institutions and the public at large. How does the substitution of one highly safe and liquid asset held by the public for another, which can only be held by banks, improve stability? Of course, if the Fed chose to finance the reserve creation by purchasing more risky assets, the action comes with additional costs and risks born by the taxpayer and ultimately constitutes a form of fiscal policy or credit allocation by the central bank.



So, what about interest rate control? The Fed has argued that the floor system leads to better control of the short‐​term rate. Yet, the volatility of short‐​term rates during the precrisis regime never seemed to interfere with the implementation of monetary policy or the transmission of the funds rate target to other short‐​term rates. Interestingly, the old system worked well when total reserves were about $40 billion and fluctuated by relatively small amounts. Recent turmoil in the repo market has led many to conclude that the current system, with reserves of about $1.6 trillion (about 4,000 percent more reserves than precrisis), falls short of the amount necessary to stabilize short‐​term rates.



Granted the regulatory environment has changed. The LCR, for example, has increased the demand for reserves, and supervisory pressure seems to have biased banks into holding reserves rather than Treasuries. The Treasury has changed the way it manages its cash balances, relying more on deposits at the Fed than private banks, thus altering the need for reserves by the depository institutions. Changes in the way LCR is computed and shifts in government balances has resulted in more uncertainty and greater volatility in the demand for reserves than in the precrisis regime. This seems to have led to the Fed intervening in a massive way to absorb shocks. Ironically, this is exactly the sort of action the Fed had been hoping to avoid by adopting the floor system.



Another operational consequence of the expansion of reserves is that the interbank market for reserves, or fed funds market, has been largely eviscerated. The system is awash in reserves without much incentive for day‐​to‐​day trading. Without an efficiently operating funds market, reserves are not moving to where they are needed, trading volume is quite small, a few large banks hold the great majority of reserves, and, even on a day when reserves were seemingly scarce, such as during the repo turmoil in September 2019, reserves were not being traded and consequently not helping address the bottlenecks that were arising. Thus, the undermining of the funds market would appear to have had unintended consequences. The Fed seems to have become the de facto market‐​maker for reserves rather than the banks.



What does this new operating regime have to do with monetary policy? The Fed argued during the crisis and subsequently that expanding the balance sheet was essential to providing monetary accommodation. However, in building its case for continuing with an operating regime with a large balance sheet, the Fed has said little about the consequences of the continued large balance sheet for the stance of monetary policy. There are ways, I think, to answer this question. For example, the Fed might contend that the effects of balance expansion only occur at the effective zero bound, although they never made that claim even when they moved off the zero bound. Markets certainly don’t seem to be of that opinion given their reaction to the shrinking of the balance sheet. Another answer might be that the effect of asset purchases was only through the acquisition of long‐​duration assets. Again, the Fed hasn’t explicitly committed to such an interpretation, although it has suggested it will slowly move to a balance sheet composed predominantly of shortterm Treasuries. Regardless, the Fed has not offered a view of how the size of the balance sheet and monetary policy are related, or not, under this new operating regime. It seems stuck in this never‐​never land where balance sheet policy matters for monetary policy at some times but not others.



There are also important governance issues that need to be resolved under this new operating regime. According to the Federal Reserve Act, it is the BoG, not the FOMC, that sets the IOR. Thus, legally, the FOMC does not have the sole authority to conduct monetary policy under this new floor system. This new regime also raises the operational question as to how the Fed will decide the appropriate size of reserve balances. Once the demand for reserves is satiated, there would seem to be no limit on the volume of reserves. How will the Fed decide on the appropriate volume of reserves? Who has the authority to do so? Is there a limiting principle? If there is no limiting principle, how will the Fed resist efforts to expand its balance sheet for other purposes?



This last question leads back to how the choice of operating regimes can impact the case for independence. In adopting a framework where a large volume of excess reserves becomes a standing feature of the operating regime, the Fed is opening the door to political interference and threats to its independence. Once the demand for reserves is satiated, there is no limit, in principle, to how big the balance sheet or volume of reserves can be. A large balance sheet unconstrained by monetary policy is ripe for abuse. Congress and an administration would be tempted to look to the balance sheet for their own purposes, including credit policy and off‐​budget fiscal policy.



Future confirmation hearings for Fed governors could take on an entirely new focus. Senators would likely be very interested to know how a prospective governor will view the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet. There could be questions regarding how the Fed should diversify its portfolio; there would likely be questions seeking support of the Fed in funding particular initiatives of Congress such as an infrastructure bill, maybe the Green New Deal, or support for failing state and local governments. As I have already mentioned, the offbudget funding of the CFPB in 2012 and the use of the Fed’s balance sheet to fund a transportation bill in 2015 might be thought of as the early signs of such a trend.



Recently, we have heard a great deal about modern monetary theory (MMT). An implication of this “new” theory, which has not gone unnoticed by politicians, is that Congress can use the Fed’s balance sheet to fund vast new spending initiatives, such as infrastructure, green investments, or social programs. Most economists find the logic of this strategy to fund large deficits troubling, if not outright nuts. But this growing appeal of MMT by some is exactly the sort of threat to independence that looms large. Yet, the Fed itself has contributed to this misguided use of its balance sheet through its unconventional policy choices, including QE, and now its new operating regime that untethers the balance sheet from monetary policy. Perhaps this threat will pass and we will muddle through somehow, but there is reason to be concerned as the price could prove quite high for Fed independence and the economy.



In summary, I think one of the biggest risks faced by the Fed, and perhaps other central banks as well, is the threat to independence. While some of the risk derives from external threats such as governments’ unwillingness to accept accountability for failed or unsustainable fiscal policies, or to address much needed structural reforms, the position of many governments has been to rely on central banks to manage the fallout.



My concern in this article has been to point out how the Fed can, at times, be its own worst enemy. The Fed has frequently accepted greater responsibility for real economic outcomes even when monetary policy has limited ability to influence such outcomes. The hubris of a “whatever it takes” attitude can lead to failed policies and loss of credibility. Unconventional policies have blurred the traditional boundaries between monetary and fiscal policy, inviting political interference. Lastly, the choice of an operating regime that decouples the balance sheet from monetary policy is a choice that is also ripe for abuse and political interference.



On a more micro level, we have seen that the floor system, as currently implemented, is not as simple or efficient as advertised. Operationally, the unintended consequences on the functioning of the money markets have been problematic, and important issues of governance and the implication for the conduct of monetary policy have not been adequately addressed. I think it is time for the Fed to take a step back and reconsider its commitment to an “ample reserves” operating system and to take more seriously the current threats and how its own actions are undermining its credibility and the case for independence.

1 In Plosser (2014), I delineated several institutional constraints on a central bank that I believed would support independence and accountability. I stressed (1) a narrow and achievable mandate to ensure accountability rather than a wish list of economic goals and objectives; (2) limits on the types of assets the bank could hold on its balance sheet to prevent credit allocation; (3) the requirement that monetary policy specify a rule‐​like strategy for implementing monetary policy to improve transparency and predictability and to limit discretionary behavior that introduces uncertainty; and, finally (4) systematic ex ante policies when acting as a lender of last resort.



2 While these rescues were sometimes explained as lender‐​of‐​last‐​resort actions, they did not follow the received wisdom passed down from Bagehot (1873), which was to lend freely at a penalty rate against good collateral in support of solvent firms—not failing firms.



3 The trend has continued. In 2015, Congress passed a transportation bill that was partially funded from the Fed’s balance sheet.

Australians pay over a billion dollars a year for the ABC. That’s a lot of money for a broadcaster almost none of us watch.



The ABC consistently scrapes the bottom of ratings. Of the twenty most-watched programs on Australian TV, just one is on the ABC.



Why Australians avoid the billion-dollar white elephant is a mystery to the ABC itself. So much so that management sent its staff on a “fact-finding tour” to the remotest corners of Australia. Abandoning the leafy seclusion of their headquarters in the harbourside Sydney suburb of Ultimo, they went all the way to…the Sydney suburb of Bankstown. Even there, though, the ABC luvvies were shocked – shocked! – to discover that the peasants in the suburbs had the temerity to think that their betters at the ABC are out of touch.



Well, the ABC are going to show those plebs in the suburbs a thing or two about who’s “out of touch”. The national broadcaster has just announced its 2020 lineup.



More of the same lefty crap they’ve been scaring audiences away with for decades.



Indigenous issues, climate change and clerical abuse spearhead a line-up of original Australian content that Michael Carrington, ABC’s director of entertainment and specialist programming, promised “will speak to and for all Australians, firing their imagination through bold content and creativity”.



Speak **at** might be the phrase he’s looking for. “Bold” and “creative” are also odd words to use to describe “the same old shit”.



Among the highlights are two new environmentally-themed series […] Award-winning journalist Sarah Ferguson will present a three-part series on clerical abuse […]from Blackfella Films comes the documentary Maralinga, in which the Indigenous Tjarutja people share their tales of survival after the bomb blast in September 1956.



[…]Meanwhile, Cate Blanchett will star in and produce new original series Stateless, a refugee drama.



“Highlights” is also an odd word to describe this woke-fest of lefty yawneroos.



Opinion polls consistently show that the issues Australians really care about are education, health care, cost of living, immigration and so on. So, what does the ABC serve us up instead? The usual gruel that so fascinates their inner-city dinner parties: refugees, Aborigines, how awful religions are (well, Christianity), climate change…



Then, of course, there’s heaping dollops of finger-wagging about “racism”, and a few has-been Brit nobodies.



The documentary The Australian Dream, in which Stan Grant grapples with the meaning of the Adam Goodes racism row […] And Miriam Margolyes, the 78-year-old beloved actor from the Harry Potter films, will examine what it means to be Australian.



Again, with those malapropriate adjectives: “beloved” for a bit-part actor almost no-one (except the tiny claque of ABC types, of course) could even name? And who better to tell Australians what it means to be Australian than a pommy blow-in.



Then there’s the usual whining about funding, from a lefty behemoth which gobbles a billion dollars of taxpayers’ money every year.



The slate announcement comes as the broadcaster continues to work its way through the implications of an effective funding cut of almost $84 million over three years, announced by the federal government last year.



The funding freeze means the ABC needs to cut $15 million from its budget in 2019-20, about $28 million in 2020-21 and just over $41 million in 2021-22.



“Effective funding cut” is a mealy-mouthed euphemism for the fact that the Morrison government laudably declined to shovel even **more** money into the ABC’s insatiable maw. The savings should be easy to find though: just make their staff join the plebs in cattle class instead of endlessly swanning about the country in business class.



This farce might be laughable if it weren’t for that billion-dollar price tag, not to mention the fact that the ABC is **required by law** to represent Australians. All Australians. The simple fact that almost **no** Australians bother to watch or listen to its crap shows how badly the national broadcaster is failing to meet its most basic legislative requirement.

"**Facebook has removed a disinformation network it says was linked to ""Roger Stone and his associates"".**
Mr Stone was a long-time political strategist and is an ally of US President Donald Trump. He was convicted of lying to Congress in 2019.
He has denied involvement with the misinformation network.
Facebook also said it had identified a network of fake accounts run by employees of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's government.
The social network released details of four misinformation campaigns ahead of the July edition of its monthly report on co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour.
""Campaigns like these raise a particularly complex challenge by blurring the line between healthy public debate and manipulation,"" Facebook said.
Facebook said it had removed 54 accounts, 50 pages, and four Instagram accounts it had linked to Mr Stone.
About 260,000 accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages.
The inauthentic pages posted about Mr Stone's websites, books, and media appearances; local politics; and material leaked by Wikileaks ahead of the US 2016 election.
Meanwhile, the fake profiles posed as Florida residents and commented on the posts to make them look more popular.
In total, those behind the pages spent about $308,000 on Facebook advertising.
Facebook said several of the inauthentic pages had links to Proud Boys, a white-supremacist hate group it had banned in 2018.
""Roger Stone's personal accounts and his branded assets will be coming down as part of this network,"" said Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cyber-security policy. ""We saw them deeply enmeshed in the activities here.""
Mr Stone told a New York Times reporter: ""I have never owned or controlled any fake Facebook, Twitter or Instagram accounts.""
Facebook has also removed 35 accounts, 14 pages, a Facebook group and 38 Instagram accounts that it says were involved in inauthentic behaviour in Brazil.
It said those responsible had created ""fictitious personas posing as reporters"" and had ""masqueraded as news outlets"".
The pages posted political memes; criticism of the political opposition, media organisations and journalists; and about the coronavirus pandemic.
Facebook said it had linked the accounts to employees in the offices of President Jair Bolsonaro, his sons Eduardo and FlÃ¡vio, and special adviser TÃ©rcio Arnaud, among others.
FlÃ¡vio Bolsonaro, a senator, said it was possible to find thousands of profiles supporting the Bolsonaro government, and to his knowledge ""they are all free and independent"".
**By Marianna Spring, disinformation and social media reporter**
Most noteworthy here are the two separate sets of inauthentic accounts - one allegedly connected to former Trump adviser Roger Stone, the other to employees of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
It's indicative of the evolution of political influence campaigns - although in the case of Mr Stone the aims appear more personal, with accounts promoting his books and Facebook pages.
The network that Facebook says is linked to the employees of President Bolsonaro seemed to have more ambitious targets, spreading disinformation and bolstering pro-government political narratives within Brazil.
News pages run by inauthentic accounts were used to promote conspiracies and criticise opponents of the Brazilian government, according to Facebook.
Some of the conspiracies that were plugged are ones that have been promoted by the Brazilian president himself - for instance, suggesting that coronavirus death tolls have been exaggerated by media outlets.
It adds to growing concerns about the use of co-ordinated online networks to target Mr Bolsonaro's opponents - and reveals techniques used around the world to spread disinformation, such as posting as news pages and PR companies.
Facebook also shared details of a disinformation campaign in Ukraine, which it said it had linked to a local advertising agency.
It also banned Canada-based PR firm Estraterra for its involvement in a foreign interference campaign targeting El Salvador, Argentina, Uruguay, Venezuela, Ecuador and Chile."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSome weeks ago the print edition of Der Spiegel presented the latest in its decade’s long series of climate scares, read background here and here.
Last month leading German climate science critic Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt sent a deservedly harsh letter to Spiegel, blasting the news weekly’s poor journalistic quality. That letter has now been published at his Die kalte Sonne site. Here’s the letter translated in English:
From: Fritz Vahrenholt
To: Spiegel
Sent: 25. February 2015
Re: Reader’s Letter on “Der verheizte Planet” in Spiegel 9/2015
LETTER
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen
The article ‘verheizte Planet’ [Heated planet] is an extremely poorly researched article that does not hold up to scientific review. As the basis for the temperature development, the time period of 1950 – 1980 was used. This was a period of cooling. Der Spiegel in its issue no. 33/1974 even carried the title ‘Is a new ice age approaching?’ In the latest article the period before 1950 in the graphic was cut out; it had been some 0.3°C warmer – a sign of natural cycles, which was completely hidden in the article. It is thus little wonder that the fact global mean temperature has not risen significantly over the past 16 years despite the constantly climbing CO2 emissions went unmentioned. Numerous recently published scientific publications show that more than 50% of the temperature rise from 1975 to 2000 is due to natural factors (solar influence, cyclic oceanic currents).
Also on the part looking at catastrophes, only the half-truth is reported. The rise shown by the EM-Dat databank from von 1970 to 2000 is owing to the fact that the databank was first set up in 1988. It is also questionable that the time period before 1970 was cut off by Spiegel because the data are close to zero as back then there were no systematic reporting. Overall the EM-Dat also records earthquakes and cold disasters. The fact that natural disaster have declined considerably since 2000 of course does not fit well with the narrative. Even the IPCC itself writes in its last report of 2013 that there is no real evidence of an increase in hurricanes, droughts, flooding, hail and storms. The Sahara is also not expanding, as the article describes, rather it is getting greener. This is shown by satellite data. Such a thing should not happen at Spiegel.
Sincerely
Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt

I’m writing two chapters in this new book, Climate Change: The Facts 2014 which will be crowd-funded to become published. I’m sure you will recognize some other names also contributing chapters in addition to my two chapters on extreme weather and the surface temperature record. I hope you’ll consider helping out bringing it to publication. There’s also a chance your help can earn you a spot on the back cover, see the details in the press release:

The Institute of Public Affairs is bringing together the biggest names in the climate change debate. Make a tax-deductible donation today to help the IPA publish a new book of research,Climate Change: The Facts 2014,and continue to influence the climate change debate in Australia.
If you donate $400 or more you will have the option of being prominently acknowledged on the back cover of Climate Change: The Facts 2014.


Here’s why contributors to Climate Change: The Facts 2014 want you to make a tax-deductible donation to the IPA today:
“This is a crucial year in the climate debate. Australia needs the IPA’s Climate Change: The Facts 2014 so our politicians get to see the evidence – such as the failure of the planet to warm since 1998, and the immeasurably small effect Australia’s global warming policies will actually have on world temperatures.”
– Andrew Bolt, contributor to Climate Change: The Facts 2014
“At last people are making up their own mind about climate change – they can see the doomsayers are wrong!”
– James Delingpole, contributor to Climate Change: The Facts 2014
“Climate change alarmists have done a great disservice to the cause of rational scientific enquiry.Climate Change: The Facts 2014is significant because it deals with the evidence.”
– Professor Stewart Franks, University of Tasmania,
contributor to Climate Change: The Facts 2014
===============================================================
I would point out that it won’t be just about Australia, it will be global in its scope.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Fraunhofer Institute has an excellent page for monitoring Germany’s installed electrical energy production capacity.
Examining the charts, we see a stunning result for Germany: Despite the almost monster 70 gigawatts of renewable energy coming online since 2002, Germany’s fossil fuel capacity has risen and reached their highest level ever in 2014!
The following chart shows Germany’s installed renewable energy capacity (wind, solar, hydro and biomass) since 2012:

Figure 1: blue = hydro; green = biomass: gray = wind, cream = solar. Source: https://energy-charts.de/power_inst_de.htm
From the above chart we that in 2002 Germany had just under 20 gigawatts of installed green capacity. Then came the renewable energy boom and that figure ballooned to almost 90 gigawatts – an amount that is enough to power the whole country on an average day.
You’d think with so much green energy capacity coming online since 2002 (close to 70 gigawatts), lots of fossil fuel capacity would get scaled back, i.e. replaced. But amazingly fossil fuel capacity has not dropped at all. To the contrary, it has reached a record high!
The next chart shows Germany’s installed fossil fuel capacity (gas, lignite, black coal), which we would have expected to drop massively due to all the green energy coming online:



<!--
google_ad_client = ""ca-pub-3545577860068042"";
/* neu test */
google_ad_slot = ""6412247007"";
google_ad_width = 200;
google_ad_height = 200;
//-->




Figure 2: Germany’s installed fossil fuel capacity for electricity generation. Source: https://energy-charts.de/power_inst_de.htm
Clearly that has not been the case. Here we see that 2010 had seen a record high with 76.70 gigawatts of installed capacity. But that mark was surpassed just last year, which saw 77.50 gigawatts of installed FOSSIL FUEL capacity – a record. The paradox is that as more green energy capacity came online, so did the unwanted, CO2-emitting fossil fuels!
Of course some of that had to do with Germany’s 2011 knee-jerk reaction of shutting down a number of its nuclear power plants in the wake of Fukushima accident, which meant fossil fuels had to jump in (because green energies are too volatile to fill in). From Figure 2 one also sees that coal capacity has been rising since 2011.
So what does this all mean? Green energies have not replaced any fossil fuel capacity in Germany. It means that consumers have gotten zero-climate protection for the 200 billion or so euros committed so far to green energies. All that money – for nothing!
Finally, the following chart shows all sources of Germany’s installed capacity:

Figure 3: Germany’s total installed capacity has skyrocketed to 177.14 gigawatts. But the demand for electricity averages only about 80 gigawatts and that has not risen at all over the past 13 years. Source: https://energy-charts.de/power_inst_de.htm
Clearly we see skyrocketing overall capacity when the overall demand for electricity remains steady. Today Germany has a total installed capacity of a whopping 177 gigawatts. The country’s average demand, however, is around just 80 gigawatts. This is an economics folly, and one that is on track to get even far more insane unless political leaders sober up quickly.
As Germany keeps bringing more and more green energy capacity on line, the more and more fossil capacity will need to be added for days when the wind and sun don’t show up.

According to an [opinion piece](https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/climate-news/117082239/zero-carbon-act-must-set-tough-targets-if-nz-is-to-help-the-world) on _Stuff_ , the Zero Carbon Act must set **“tough targets”** if New Zealand is to “ **help the world.”** Well apart from the fact that it won’t do a bloody thing to “help the world” I expect the New Zealand government to put the needs of New Zealanders above the needs of the world. 



This is New Zealand NOT the United Nations. Our government is tasked with governing New Zealand not **decimating our primary industries** in the totally misguided belief that it will somehow change the climate for other countries by point something, something of a percent…maybe.



This is like a girl giving away all the cash in her mum’s wallet (that was set aside to feed the family) to the meth addict down the road in the hope that he will use it to get a job and because she knew it would impress the girl she wants to be friends with who lives in the same street.



The Zero Carbon Act might look good on the outside to climate change extremists but it achieves NOTHING and it will hurt New Zealanders.



 **OPINION:** The Zero Carbon Bill will go through its final votes this week […] **its bigger purpose** – providing a framework for New Zealand to help keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius of pre-industrial levels – risks being lost in the process of political negotiation and compromise. 



Its “purpose” is ludicrous. **There is no evidence that mankind can control the climate.** How anyone can spout this rubbish with a straight face is beyond me.



Every percentage point of emissions reductions and every tenth of a degree of warming matters. **It matters** for how much arable land northern African communities will have for growing food, how many extreme heatwaves hit Indian cities, how many cyclones devastate the Caribbean, or whether our Pacific neighbours have coral reefs from which to fish or are instead forced to retreat as sea levels rise. 



**No, it doesn’t matter.** Even if it were possible it still would not be the responsibility of little old New Zealand to attempt to make growing food in Africa a tiny bit easier for Africans especially when just the attempt to do so will hurt New Zealanders’ food production.



[…] Both our prime minister and the climate change minister have made much of the fact that New Zealand **could be the first** in the world to put the 1.5C goal into law. 



Woopdee doo! Do they also want New Zealand to be the first perfectly functional and wealthy small democracy to be tuned into the Venezuela of the South Pacific?



The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has laid out the science that, for **a good chance** of keeping warming within 1.5C, global emissions must halve by 2030 and reach net zero by about 2050. This task is inextricably tied to questions of justice, and who bears the burden of action. Some countries, sectors and corporations are clearly more **responsible** than others. 



Some countries put their own citizens first. Africa is not New Zealand’s responsibility and the rest of the world isn’t either. What arrogance to act as if New Zealand were some kind of a superpower capable of changing the climates of other countries.



This is real life not a Marvel comic. Humans **cannot** control the weather or the climate, not even if they are bitten by a radioactive spider!

To many, Donald Trump’s rise in the Republican primaries and eventually to the presidency represented an astonishing break with the foreign policy consensus that had prevailed from Harry Truman to Barack Obama. The broad pillars of post–World War II U.S. grand strategy, pursued with remarkable continuity from 1945 to 2016, prescribed an international order made dependent on U.S. military predominance. Washington extended security commitments to scores of allies and client states and deployed a permanent globe‐​straddling forward military presence. It installed itself as leader of the major political and economic international institutions established after World War II and relied on the frequent threat and use of force to pursue a wide range of perceived national interests, not merely to protect America’s physical security. The foreign policy preferences of candidate Trump, many argued, were a radical departure from these long‐​standing grand strategic imperatives.



“I think NATO is obsolete,” Trump said in an interview with ABC News in March 2016, roughly two months before he would secure the nomination of the Republican Party. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a security alliance established in the early years of the Cold War to contain Soviet influence in Europe, had until now been an unassailable element of bipartisan foreign policy doctrine. It obligates member nations to treat an attack on any member as an attack on all of them. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States kept the alliance in place and later expanded it to the far eastern reaches of Europe. NATO has come to represent much more than a defensive security alliance. Washington largely sees it as the fulcrum of peace in Europe and an institutional model for promoting democracy, extending economic integration, and allowing the United States to maintain its leadership of the so‐​called liberal international order.



October 21, 2019 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM EDT  
Hayek Auditorium, Cato Institute



Trump’s dismissal of NATO as obsolete in a world without the Soviet Union was consistent with his expressed frustration with allies’ free riding on U.S. protection. “We are being ripped off by everybody,” Trump said in October 2016. “We have to renegotiate these agreements because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places.” In addition, candidate Trump spoke somewhat cavalierly of the prospect of nuclear weapons proliferation in South Korea and Japan, countries that had abstained from building their own nuclear deterrents thanks in part to American security guarantees. This position also sharply deviated from the foreign policy consensus in Washington, which understands the U.S.-led international security architecture—centered on U.S. security commitments and extended deterrence—as a vital and incontestable American responsibility.



Fuel to the Fire: How Trump Made America’s Broken Foreign Policy Even Worse (and How We Can Recover)



Trump repeatedly called for an accommodative posture toward Moscow. In verbiage he would use again and again, Trump told Fox News in April 2016, “If we can make a great deal for our country and get along with Russia, that would be a tremendous thing.” And he told a crowd in Scranton, Pennsylvania, “Wouldn’t it be a great thing if we could get along with Russia?” Such comments sounded dissonant coming from a Republican candidate for president, but they became particularly controversial in light of subsequent assessments by the U.S. intelligence community that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election on Trump’s behalf.



Trump also boldly attacked regime‐​change and nation‐​building wars, missions that the United States had taken up with increasing frequency in the post–Cold War era and with conspicuously bitter results. In the aftermath of the Iraq War debacle and the ongoing military quagmire in Afghanistan, public opinion soured on costly ground wars intended to replace far‐​off regimes with nominally democratic ones. However, the national security establishment continues to value such operations as critical tools of U.S. foreign policy and seems to view Trump’s rhetorical attacks as a ploy to exploit public war fatigue in a way that threatens to sap support for even limited military action. Because the post–World War II order requires a generous dose of U.S. military activity, Trump’s brickbats led to much establishment handwringing over the possible crumbling of that order.



These frenzied fears about the demolition of America’s enduring grand strategic duties have proved overwrought. A bird’s-eye view of President Trump’s foreign policy reveals that he has not retreated from the world and that there is much more continuity with the policies of his predecessors than change.



In the Middle East, Trump increased the number of deployed U.S. troops by more than 30 percent in his first year while loosening the rules of engagement to intensify ongoing bombing campaigns across multiple countries. He doubled down on America’s traditional alliances, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, while reasserting U.S. hostility toward long‐​standing adversaries, like Syria and Iran. The administration’s “maximum pressure” policy toward Iran, which included abrogating the Obama‐​era nuclear deal and imposing unrelenting economic warfare on the country, nearly brought the United States to the brink of another disastrous Middle East war. With help from traditionally hawkish cabinet members like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the former national security adviser John Bolton, Trump’s Iran policy was barely distinguishable from the deepest desires of Bush‐​era neoconservatives bent on regime change.



Security policy toward Latin America also saw little change. As if to emphasize the essentially conventional nature of Trump’s approach, Bolton coined the phrase “Troika of Tyranny,” an implicit allusion to the Bush administration’s “Axis of Evil,” as a call to confront the regimes in Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. In particular, the Trump White House has made a point of targeting the Venezuelan regime with persistent threats, hostility, and economic sanctions. Numerous times, the administration explicitly threatened U.S. military action in Venezuela unless the Maduro regime gave up power; it also made explicit reference to the prospect of an internal military coup.



In Europe, Trump has tactlessly berated European allies for not carrying their own weight in terms of national defense and deliberately made European leaders doubt the reliability of America’s security commitment without actually initiating a formal revision to it. He increased U.S. troop deployments in the region while reaffirming America’s Article 5 security commitment to NATO countries. In his first year in office, he welcomed Montenegro as the 29th NATO member country and vowed to challenge Russia’s “destabilizing activities” in Eastern Europe. He provided aid to Ukraine—not a NATO ally—to battle Russian‐​backed separatists and toyed with establishing a new U.S. military base in Poland.



In East Asia, Trump also reaffirmed long‐​standing U.S. security commitments to allies and partners, from South Korea and Japan to Taiwan and the Philippines. America’s forward presence remained robust, with more than 150,000 active‐​duty military personnel stationed at scores of military bases throughout the region and more than half of overall U.S. naval strength regularly patrolling the Pacific theater. By launching a trade war against Beijing, he has helped lock in the image of China as an implacable nemesis that America must confront in the 21st century.



Although Trump had decried the war in Afghanistan as a wasteful quagmire and pledged to “[get] out of the nation‐​building business,” as president, he dispatched an additional 4,000 U.S. troops to the mission, thus ensuring that the longest war in U.S. history would continue. Again, this does not fit the model of Trump as a determined opponent of the Washington foreign policy establishment and the U.S.-led hegemonic order.



Thanks to his lack of previous foreign policy experience and his general policy illiteracy, Trump relies on an existing set of personal and political impulses.



These broad areas of consistency shouldn’t be interpreted to mean that there has been nothing unique about Trump’s approach to foreign affairs. In a few critical policy areas, he has undeniably resisted pressure to conform. Thanks to his lack of previous foreign policy experience and his general policy illiteracy, Trump relies on an existing set of personal and political impulses. For example, Trump clings to an almost unwavering zero‐​sum transactional worldview, which explains why he favors unusually protectionist trade policies and why he seems to spend at least as much time criticizing allies, entwined with the United States militarily and economically, as he does adversaries, who usually have fewer such ties.



Another clear distinction is Trump’s penchant for eschewing multilateral agreements and abruptly withdrawing from international organizations. Trump withdrew from the Paris climate agreement; the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP); the Iran nuclear deal; the Intermediate‐​Range Nuclear Forces Treaty; the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; and the UN Human Rights Council. He seems to have a visceral distaste for international arrangements of any kind, reflecting his Jacksonian emphasis on national sovereignty and rejection of globalist designs.



Trump also has distinct authoritarian tendencies, which might explain the notable lack of rhetoric about the importance of promoting democracy and liberal values in U.S. foreign policy under his administration.



Trump also has distinct authoritarian tendencies, which might explain the notable lack of rhetoric about the importance of promoting democracy and liberal values in U.S. foreign policy under his administration. These tendencies also help explain Trump’s undermining of basic norms in the conduct of foreign policy. For example, his apparent attempt to pressure the president of Ukraine to provide dirt on his domestic political rivals during an election year is a novel—and shocking—way to exercise presidential power in foreign affairs.



Trump’s largely peaceful diplomacy with North Korea’s Kim Jong‐​Un certainly represents another departure from the norm, at least as far as Republican Party doctrine is concerned. This new approach is driven in large part by Trump’s affinity for stagecraft rather than statecraft. Trump is fixated on his—and by extension America’s—status and prestige. He craves the pageantry, not the substance, of diplomacy. He enjoys the wall‐​to‐​wall cable news television coverage of his summitry and the accompanying whispers of Nobel Peace Prize glory. The approach has largely failed: though North Korea has made a few perfunctory concessions to demonstrate good faith, the regime in Pyongyang has not taken substantive steps to roll back its nuclear weapons program, largely because Washington has yet to lift economic sanctions but also because Pyongyang simply doesn’t trust the United States. The president’s refusal to acknowledge the intelligence community’s findings on the status of Pyongyang’s program suggests he is more interested in the appearance of a good deal than how to achieve one.



Overall, Trump has mostly stuck to the primacy playbook. But given the bracing challenge to traditional American foreign policy that Trump outlined during his campaign, why does so much of his foreign policy look so similar to the policies of primacy from the past several decades? Why has he implemented his “America First” vision in a few cases but not in others? After all, people have been worrying about excessive presidential power in foreign affairs since long before Trump took office.



A close look at Trump’s track record suggests a few answers. First, the vastly expanded powers of the modern presidency help explain Trump’s successful efforts to make changes. Thanks to a slew of prior congressional decisions to empower the White House in trade negotiations, Trump has happily exercised unilateral action to withdraw from the TPP, renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, and launch a trade war with China. On the other hand, Trump could have also pushed for more change in other areas where he enjoys a relatively free hand. Why, despite his very public doubts about the wisdom of foreign military occupations, has Trump expanded the U.S. presence in Afghanistan, Syria, and the Middle East more broadly?



Fuel to the Fire: How Trump Made America’s Broken Foreign Policy Even Worse (and How We Can Recover)



One theory is that much of what Trump said on the campaign was just rhetoric and that once on the job, he realized that the status quo wasn’t as foolish as he had once believed. This might, for example, explain why Trump has decided to keep troops in Afghanistan and elsewhere. As he told the Washington Post at one point, “We’re there because virtually every expert that I have and speak to [says] if we don’t go there, they’re going to be fighting over here.”



Another argument is that Trump knows and cares little about matters of foreign policy, leading to a turbulent and unpredictable approach to policymaking. Trump careens from issue to issue, changing policy via Twitter without warning his own national security team. The chaos also extends to his national security team, which has turned over at a rate exceeding any previous White House. All of this, in turn, limits his administration’s ability to implement major foreign policy change.



Trump has faced all the strategic and structural constraints that have long served to keep American foreign policy moving in the same general direction.



Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Trump has faced all the strategic and structural constraints that have long served to keep American foreign policy moving in the same general direction. Seven decades spent pursuing primacy have imbued the status quo with tremendous inertia—difficult for even a determined president to change. Not only do most politicians in Washington hew to the bipartisan consensus around primacy, but so do most of the bureaucrats and policymakers in the foreign policy establishment—“the Blob,” as President Obama’s adviser called it.



This consensus props up primacy and pushes back against Trump in at least three ways. First, through think tanks, talk shows, and other media, the Blob dominates public debates and shapes public opinion. Second, by dominating the pool of people from which presidents typically choose their national security team, the Blob can work from the inside to block and blunt attempts to shift course. Many members of Trump’s initial national security team, including Generals Flynn, McMaster, Kelly, and Mattis, built their careers on the basis of operations justified entirely by primacy’s core assumptions. The result in many cases has been a high level of internal opposition to Trump’s foreign policy instincts. Though Trump has certainly overruled his advisers at times, no president has the bandwidth to fight every fight. And where Trump has avoided those battles, primacy persists.



Expert examinations of Trump’s foreign policy preferences consistently give the president more credit for having a clear vision of foreign policy than is warranted. Indeed, there are compelling reasons to doubt that the president has ever systematically contemplated the foreign policy issues over which he now has ultimate authority.



President Trump is probably the least informed, least experienced, and least intellectually prepared U.S. president in modern memory—perhaps in American history. “He didn’t know a lot of details,” Steve Bannon said of candidate Trump. “He knew almost no policy.” His rhetoric reveals mostly policy illiteracy, and he seems to lack the rigor and acuity to digest new information in a sophisticated way.



In June 2017, the Washington Post reported that “in private conversations on Capitol Hill, Trump is often not taken seriously” and that many “Republican lawmakers … are quick to point out how little command he demonstrates of policy.” Trump’s national security team has had to develop novel ways of briefing the president, relying on one‐​page, bullet‐​pointed memos and lots of visual aids to cope with his “notoriously short attention span.” As national security adviser, H. R. McMaster reinvented the process. According to the New Yorker, the “multi‐​page explications of policy and strategy” that used to accompany daily briefings were traded for one‐​page memos after the National Security Council received “an edict” from the White House to “thin it out.” Even then, the White House reportedly said single‐​page memos were still too long and suggested briefing Trump “pictorially.”

Yet some of Trump’s rhetoric, when taken out of context, does resemble coherent ideas in the field of international relations, particularly certain strains of academic realism that advocate for a more restrained U.S. foreign policy. Opponents of these ideas in the policy community have frequently mischaracterized Trump’s “America First” views as variously isolationist, noninterventionist, realist, or restrained. Some have even gone so far as to explicitly associate Trump with these restraint‐​oriented schools of thought, suggesting that he had even the vaguest understanding of these well‐​developed ideas.



Undeniably, Trump was elected despite saying things deeply at odds with the view of the U.S. role in the world that prevails in Washington. In practice, as shown above, Trump has by no means pursued a strategy of restraint.



Restraint is an idea whose time has come; actually, it is long overdue. Despite hysterical news headlines and the ubiquitous elite haranguing about existential national security threats, today’s international system is remarkably peaceful and stable. The United States, thanks to its geographic isolation and its outsized economic and military power, is particularly insulated from foreign threats.



America has been at war for two out of every three years since the end of the Cold War. About 46 percent of Americans have lived the majority of their lives with the United States at war.



Yet our foreign policy does not reflect this benign security environment. America has been at war for two out of every three years since the end of the Cold War. About 46 percent of Americans have lived the majority of their lives with the United States at war. Washington has engaged in more military interventions in the past 30 years than it had in the preceding 190 years. This hyperactivist, heavily militaristic foreign policy has not only been unnecessary, costly, and counterproductive for U.S. interests but has occurred in a period of declining relative U.S. power.



Following World War II, after the other great powers had been devastated by conflict, the United States accounted for about 50 percent of global economic output, making it hard for our ambition to truly exceed our means. That figure stood at 22 percent as recently as the 1980s, but today the U.S. share has fallen to 15 percent, and the International Monetary Fund projects that it will slip to 13.9 percent by 2023. Such figures mostly reflect the fact that billions of people around the world have lifted themselves out of grinding poverty, a process aided by the embrace of liberalism and market economics. Such human progress should be celebrated. Still, U.S. foreign policy has not adapted; its goals are suited to a time long since passed, when the available resources seemed nearly limitless.



Change has been slow in coming, owing to the policy consensus around the grand strategy of primacy, which prescribes an expansive conception of the U.S. role in the world that requires overspending on the military and the elevation of peripheral interests to the level of vital ones. A grand strategy of restraint, by contrast, counsels prudence, nonintervention in the affairs of other countries, and a more modest set of objectives and interests. It eschews elective wars, unrealistic nation‐​building schemes, and the pursuit of hegemony. It draws from a rich history of U.S. foreign policy in which, as one of America’s preeminent statesmen (and eventual president) John Quincy Adams put it, America “goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy” and “is the well‐​wisher to the freedom and independence of all” but “the champion and vindicator only of her own.” Adams warned that if America went down the path of global dominion,



she would involve herself beyond the power of extrication, in all the wars of interest and intrigue, of individual avarice, envy, and ambition, which assume the colors and usurp the standard of freedom. The fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force.… She might become the dictatress of the world. She would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit.



Restraint in U.S. foreign policy is ripe for a revival. Primacy has indeed entangled us in gratuitous wars of interest, intrigue, and hubristic ambition, but they are not, we believe, beyond the power of extrication.



Trump’s entry into the presidency and onto the world stage has fortuitously prompted a much‐​needed debate about grand strategy. What America needs is not Trump’s “America First,” nor a return to the status quo ante, but a radical reevaluation of its role in the world.

Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee, it is a great pleasure to have been invited to share my perspectives on the Export‐​Import Bank, its reauthorization request, and the role of government in export financing. My intention is to focus primarily on the domestic victims of the Export‐​Import Bank (“Ex‐​Im”) by describing some of the hidden costs — the collateral damage — that are often overlooked or swept under the rug.



To the extent that today's hearing will help illuminate the holistic impact of Ex-Im on the U.S. economy and the market process — in contrast to the cherry-picked examples of how Ex-Im has helped particular companies meet their particular goals — I am pleased to participate and offer some assistance.



Before turning to that task, however, I would like to applaud the committee for taking up this important subject in a public hearing. Committed oversight of the executive branch by the legislative branch is crucial to our system of checks and balances, which must remain functionally robust to ensure the health of our constitutional republic, and protect it from even the most subtle encroachments.



 **Insulated in Export Rhetoric**



Everyone loves exports. In fact, many Americans think of trade as a competition between ""Us"" and ""Them,"" where exports are Team USA's points, imports are the foreign team's points, the trade account is the scoreboard, and the deficit on that scoreboard means our team is losing at trade. That narrative is wrong, but certainly ripe for exploitation by agencies that portray themselves as serving some national goal of boosting exports.



The economic fact of the matter is that the real benefits of trade are transmitted through imports, not through exports. As Milton Friedman used to say: imports are the goods and services we get to consume without having to produce; exports are the goods and services we produce, but don't get to consume.



The purpose of exchange is to enable each of us to focus on what we do best. By specializing in an occupation — instead of allocating small portions of our time to producing each of the necessities and luxuries we wish to consume — and exchanging the monetized output we produce most efficiently for the goods and services we produce less efficiently, we are able to produce and, thus, consume more output than would be the case if we didn't specialize and trade. By extension, the larger the size of the market, the greater is the scope for specialization, exchange, and economic growth.



When we transact at the local supermarket or hardware store, we seek to maximize the value we obtain by getting the most for our dollars. In other words, we want to import more value from the local merchant than we wish to export. In our daily transactions, we seek to run personal trade deficits. But when it comes to trading across borders or when our individual transactions are aggregated at the national level, we forget these basics principles and assume the goal of exchange is to achieve a trade surplus. But, as Adam Smith famously observed: ""What is prudence in the conduct of every private family, can scarce be folly in that of a great kingdom.""



The benefits of trade come from imports, which deliver more competition, greater variety, lower prices, better quality, and innovation. Arguably, opening foreign markets should be _an aim_ of trade policy because larger markets allow for greater specialization and economies of scale, but real free trade requires liberalization at home. The real benefits of trade are measured by the value of imports that can be purchased with a unit of exports — the so-called terms of trade. Trade barriers at home raise the costs and reduce the amount of imports that can be purchased with a unit of exports.



Yet, in Washington, exports are associated with increased economic output and job creation, while imports are presumed to cause economic contraction and job loss. But that is demonstrably false. The first1 of the two charts below plots annual changes in imports and annual changes in GDP for 44 years. If imports caused economic contraction, we would expect to see most of the observations in the upper left and lower right quadrants — depicting an inverse relationship. Instead, we see a strong positive relationship. In 43 of 44 years, imports and GDP moved in the same direction.





The second2 chart plots annual changes in imports and U.S. employment. Similarly, there is a fairly strong positive relationship between these variables, as well.





In keeping with the conventional Washington wisdom that exports are Team America's points and imports are the foreign team's points, in his January 2010 State of the Union address President Obama set a national goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years. That goal was subsequently enshrined as the ""National Export Initiative,"" which decreed establishment of an Export Promotion Cabinet ""to develop and coordinate the implementation of the NEI."" Six months later, the new cabinet produced its recommendations in a 68-page report titled ""The Export Promotion Cabinet's Plan for Doubling U.S. Exports in Five Years,"" which became the centerpiece of the administration's trade policy agenda.



Most prominent in the plan was a larger role for government in promoting exports, including expanded nonmarket lending programs to finance export activity, an increase in the number of the Commerce Department's foreign outposts to promote U.S. business, an increase in federal agency-chaperoned marketing trips, and other sundry subsidies for export-oriented business activities. Ex-Im suddenly had a more prominent role to play.



Shortsightedly, the NEI systemically neglected a broad swath of opportunities to facilitate exports by contemplating only the export-focused activities of exporters. The NEI presumed that the only barriers impeding U.S. exporters were foreign made. But before companies become exporters, they are producers. And as producers, they are subject to a host of domestic laws, regulations, taxes, and other policies that handicap them in their competition for sales in the U.S. market and abroad.



For example, nearly 60 percent of the value of U.S. imports in 2014 comprised of intermediate goods, capital goods, and other raw materials — the purchases of U.S. businesses, not consumers.3 Yet, many of those imported inputs are subject to customs duties, which raise the cost of production for the U.S.-based companies that need them, making them less competitive at home and abroad. Indeed, U.S. duties on products like sugar, steel, magnesium, polyvinyl chloride, and other crucial manufacturing inputs have chased companies to foreign shores — where those crucial ingredients are less expensive — and deterred foreign companies from setting up shop stateside.4



To nurture the promise of our highly integrated global economy, policymakers should stop conflating the interests of exporters with the national interest and commit to policies that reduce frictions throughout the supply chain — from product conception to consumption. Why should U.S. taxpayers underwrite — and U.S. policymakers promote — the interests of exporters, anyway, when the benefits of those efforts accrue, primarily, to the shareholders of the companies enjoying the subsidized marketing or matchmaking? There is no national ownership of private export revenues. And the relationship between revenues (domestic or export) and jobs is today more tenuous than in years past.



Globalization means that companies have growing options with respect to where and how they produce. So governments must compete for investment and talent, which both tend to flow to jurisdictions where the rule of law is clear and abided; where there is greater certainty to the business and political climate; where the specter of asset expropriation is negligible; where physical and administrative infrastructure is in good shape; where the local work force is productive; where there are limited physical, political, and administrative frictions; and so on. The crucial question for U.S. policymakers is: why not focus on reforms that make the U.S. economy a more attractive location for both domestic and foreign investment?



According to the Congressional Research Service, there are approximately 20 federal government agencies involved in supporting U.S. exports, either directly or indirectly. Among the nine key agencies with programs or activities directly related to export promotion are the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the Small Business Administration, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, and the Export-Import Bank.



Relative to attracting domestic investment, export promotion is a circuitous and uncertain path to economic growth and job creation. If policymakers seek a more appropriate target for economic policy, it should be attracting and retaining investment, which is the seed of all economic activity, including exporting.



 **Problems with Ex-Im's Rationalizations**



The mission of the Ex-Im is ""to support American jobs by facilitating the export of U.S. goods and services."" Given the exalted status of exports in Washington's economic policy narrative, it is understandable why Ex-Im would portray itself as indispensable to U.S. export success. It's a reasonable survival strategy. But on the metric of contribution to export success, Ex-Im is scarcely relevant. It supported $27.4 billion in exports in 2014, which is less than 2 percent of all U.S. exports last year.5



Of course, $27 billion is nothing to sneeze at, but the implication that most, if not all, of those sales would never have happened in the absence of Ex-Im is pure nonsense. But the more important question is not whether Ex-Im supports U.S. exports. That's the political question. The relevant economic question concerns the costs and benefits of Ex-Im to the U.S. economy.



Proponents limit their analyses to the impact of Ex-Im on taxpayers. In recent years, it has generated positive returns to the Treasury, but that myopic focus doesn't come close to approximating the appropriate cost-benefit analysis.



While the benefits of Ex-Im's activities are real to the recipients and visible to the public (the value of exports supported, projects financed, insurance policies underwritten are all highly touted), the costs imposed on non-beneficiaries usually go unseen by its victims — and unacknowledged by Ex-Im and its supporters. Identifying and quantifying those costs are necessary to measuring the net benefits.



Ex-Im supporters claim that the bank fills a void left by private sector lenders unwilling to finance certain riskier transactions and, by doing so, contributes importantly to U.S. export and job growth. Moreover, rather than burden taxpayers, the Bank generates profits for the Treasury, helps small businesses succeed abroad, encourages exports of ""green"" goods, contributes to development in sub-Saharan Africa, and helps ""level the playing field"" for U.S. companies competing in export markets with foreign companies supported by their own governments' generous export financing programs. So what's not to like about Ex-Im?



First, by dismissing the risk assessments of private-sector, profit-maximizing financial firms and making lending decisions based on nonmarket criteria to pursue often opaque, political objectives, Ex-Im misallocates resources and puts taxpayer dollars at risk. That Ex-Im is currently self-financing and generating revenues is entirely beside the point. Ex-Im's revenue stream depends on whether foreign borrowers are willing and able to service their loans, which is a function of global economic conditions beyond the control of Ex-Im. Given the large concentration of aircraft loans in its portfolio, for example, Ex-Im is heavily exposed to the consequences of a decline in demand for air travel. Recall that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also showed book profits for years until the housing market suddenly crashed and taxpayers were left holding the bag.



Second, even if taxpayers had tolerance for such risk taking, the claim that Ex-Im exists to help small businesses is belied by the fact that most of Ex-Im's loan portfolio value is concentrated among a handful of large U.S. companies. In 2013 roughly 75 percent of the value of Ex-Im loans, guarantees, and insurance were granted on behalf of 10 large companies, including Boeing, General Electric, Dow Chemical, Bechtel, and Caterpillar.



Third, the claim that U.S. exporters need assistance with financing to ""level the playing field"" with China and others doesn't square with the fact that the United States is a major export credit subsidizer that has been engaged in doling out such largesse since well before the founding of the People's Republic of China. It implies the United States is helpless at the task of reining in these subsidies. And it implies the United States lacks enormous advantages among the multitude of factors that inform the purchasing decision. But, somehow, 98 percent of U.S. export value is sold without the assistance of trade promotion agencies.



Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, by trying to ""level the playing field"" with foreign companies backed by their own governments, Ex-Im ""unlevels"" the playing field for many more U.S. companies competing at home and abroad. This adverse effect has been ignored, downplayed, or mischaracterized, but the collateral damage is substantial and should be a central part of the story.



 **The Collateral Damage to Ex-Im's Victims**



A proper accounting reveals that Ex-Im's practices impose significant costs on manufacturing firms across every industry and in every U.S. state. When Ex-Im provides financing to a U.S. company's foreign customer on terms more favorable than he can secure elsewhere, it may be facilitating a transaction that would not otherwise occur. That is the basis for Ex-Im's claim that it helps the U.S. economy by increasing exports and ""supporting"" jobs. But the claim is questionable because those resources might have created more value or more jobs if deployed in the private sector instead. If that is the case, Ex-Im's transaction imposes a net loss on the economy. But suppose it could be demonstrated that Ex-Im transactions grow the economy larger or create more jobs than if those resources had been deployed in the private sector instead. Would Ex-Im then be correct in its claim? No. Further analysis is required.



Ex-Im financing helps two sets of companies (in the short-run): U.S. firms whose export prices are subsidized by below market rate financing and the foreign firms who purchase those subsidized exports. It stands to reason, then, that those same transactions might impose costs on two different sets of companies: competing U.S. firms in the same industry who do not get Ex-Im backing, and U.S. firms in downstream industries, whose foreign competition is now benefitting from reduced capital costs courtesy of U.S. government subsidies. While Ex-Im financing reduces the cost of doing business for the lucky U.S. exporter and reduces the cost of capital for his foreign customer, it hurts U.S. competitors of the U.S. exporter, as well as U.S. competitors of his foreign customer by putting them at relative cost disadvantages.



These effects are neither theoretical nor difficult to comprehend. Yet proponents of Ex-Im reauthorization rarely acknowledge, let alone concede, that these are real costs pertinent to any legitimate net benefits calculation. Instead, they speak only of the gross benefits of export subsidies, which they consider to be the value of exports supported by their authorizations.



But there are at least three sets of costs that are essential to determining the net benefits of Ex-Im: (1) the "" **Opportunity Cost** ,"" represented by the export growth that would have obtained had Ex-Im's resources been deployed in the private sector; (2) the "" **Intra-Industry Cost** ,"" represented by the relative cost disadvantage imposed on the other U.S. firms in the same industry (the domestic competitors) as a result of Ex-Im's subsidies to a particular firm in the industry, and; (3) the "" **Downstream Industry Cost** ,"" represented by the relative cost disadvantage imposed on the U.S. competitors of the subsidized foreign customer.



Opportunity Cost is difficult to estimate, but suffice it to recognize that opportunity costs exist. Indeed, opportunity costs exist whenever there are foregone alternatives to the path chosen.



The Intra-Industry Cost is somewhat easier to calculate, in theory. If Ex-Im provides a $50 million loan to a foreign farm equipment manufacturer to purchase steel from U.S. Steel Corporation, the transaction may benefit U.S. Steel, but it hurts competitors like Nucor, Steel Dynamics, AK Steel, and dozens of other steel firms operating in the United States and competing for the same customers at home and abroad. The $50 million subsidy to U.S. Steel is a cost to the other firms in the industry, who can attribute a $50 million revenue gap between them (aggregated) and U.S. Steel to a government intervention that picked a winner and made them, relatively speaking, losers. The $50 million ""benefit"" for U.S. Steel is a $50 million cost to the other steel firms.



But then that distortion is compounded when taking into consideration the dynamics that would have played out had the best firm — the one offering the most value for the best price — secured that export deal instead. Reaching revenue targets, raising capital, and moving down the production cost curve to generate lower unit costs all become more difficult to achieve on account of the original intervention, amplifying the adverse impact on other firms in the industry.



When government intervenes with subsidies that tilt the playing field in favor of a particular firm, it simultaneously penalizes the other firms in the industry and changes the competitive industry dynamics going forward. Every Ex-Im transaction touted as boosting U.S. exports creates victims within the same U.S. industry. Without Ex-Im's intervention, Nucor might have been able to win that foreign farm equipment producer's business, which is a prospect that undermines the premise that Ex-Im boosts exports at all and reinforces the point that it merely shifts resources around without creating value, possibly destroys value instead. What is given to U.S. steel is taken from Nucor and the other firms, among whom may be the more efficient producers.



The Downstream Industry costs are those imposed by the transaction on the U.S. companies that compete with the foreign customer. When a foreign farm machinery producer purchases steel on credit at subsidized interest rates, it obtains an advantage over its competitors — including its U.S. competitors. So, when that subsidized rate comes courtesy of a U.S. government program committed to increasing U.S. exports, it only seems reasonable to consider the effects on firms in downstream U.S. industries before claiming the program a success: Has the subsidy to the foreign farm machinery producer made John Deere, Caterpillar, New Holland, or other U.S. farm machinery producers less competitive? Has it hurt their bottom lines?



Delta Airlines has been vocal in its objection to Ex-Im-facilitated sales of Boeing jetliners to foreign carriers, such as Air India. Delta rightly complains that the U.S. government, as a matter of policy, is subsidizing Delta's foreign competition by reducing Air India's cost of capital. That cost reduction enables Air India to offer lower prices in its bid to compete for passengers, which has a direct impact on Delta's bottom line. This is a legitimate concern and it is not limited to this example.



Consider the generic case. A U.S. supplier sells to both U.S. and foreign customers. Those customers compete in the same downstream industry in the U.S. and foreign markets. Ex-Im is happy to provide financing to facilitate the sale, as its mission is to increase exports and create jobs. The U.S. supplier is thrilled that Ex-Im is providing his foreign customer with cheap credit because it spares him from having to offer a lower price or from sweetening the deal in some other way to win the business. The foreign customer is happy to accept the advantageous financing for a variety of reasons, among which is the fact that his capital costs are now lower relative to what they would have been and relative to the costs of his competitors — including his U.S. competitors, who are now on the outside looking in. Ex-Im helps some U.S. companies increase their exports sales. But it hinders other U.S. companies' efforts to compete at home and abroad.



Moreover, by subsidizing export sales, Ex-Im artificially diverts domestic supply, possibly causing U.S. prices to rise and rendering U.S. customers less important to their U.S. suppliers. Especially in industries where there are few producers, numerous customers, and limited substitute products, Ex-Im disrupts the relationships between U.S. buyers and U.S. sellers by infusing the latter with greater market power and leverage. Delta was able to connect the dots. Other companies have, too. But most of the time, the downstream U.S. companies are unwitting victims of this silent cost-shifting.



According to the findings in a recent Cato Institute study that I authored, the downstream costs alone amount to a tax of approximately $2.8 billion every year.6 The victims of this shell game include companies in each of the 21 broad U.S. manufacturing industry classifications used by the government to compile statistics. And they are scattered across the country in every state. Among the stealthily taxed were companies such as Western Digital and Seagate Technologies — two California-based computer storage device producers that employ 125,000 workers; Chicago-based Schneider Electric Holdings, which employs 23,000 workers in the manufacture of environmental control products, and; ViaSystems, a St. Louis-based printed circuit board producer with 12,000 employees. These companies haven't received Ex-Im subsidies, but companies in their supplier industries have, which effectively lowers the costs of their foreign competitors.



While it is relatively easy for a big company like Delta to connect the dots and see that Boeing is being favored at its expense (airplane purchases constitute a large share of Delta's total costs), most manufacturing companies are unaware that they are shouldering the costs of government subsidies to their own competitors. But the victims include big and small producers — of electrical equipment, appliances, furniture, food, chemicals, computers, electronics, plastics and rubber products, paper, metal, textiles — from across the country. Companies producing telecommunications equipment incur an estimated collective tax of $125 million per year.



The industries in which companies bear the greatest burdens — where the costs of Ex-Im's subsidies to foreign competitors are the highest — are of vital importance to the manufacturing economies of most states. In Oregon, Delaware, Idaho, New Jersey, Nevada, and Maryland, the 10 industries shouldering the greatest costs account for at least 80 percent of the state's manufacturing output. The most important industry is among the ten most burdened by these costs in 33 of 50 states. The chemical industry, which bears a cost of $107 million per year, is the largest manufacturing industry in 12 states.



For all the praise Ex-Im heaps upon itself for its role as a costless pillar of the economy, it is difficult to make sense of the collateral damage left in its wake. Thousands of U.S. companies would be better off if Ex-Im's charter were allowed to expire, as scheduled, on June 30.



 **What to do about Foreign Export Credit Agencies?**



Of all of the arguments put forward by Ex-Im supporters, the ""leveling the playing field"" rationale seems to carry the most sway. It is appealing intuitively. But the implication that the United States is an innocent party that has no choice but to follow suit is laughable. The United States invented this stuff.



The notion that because Beijing, Brasilia, and Brussels subsidize their exporters Washington must, too, is a rationalization that sweeps under the rug the fact that there are dozens of criteria that feed into the ultimate purchasing decision, including product quality, price, producer's reputation, local investment and employment opportunities created by the sale, warranties, after-market servicing, and the extent to which the transaction contributes toward building a long-term relationship between buyer and seller. To say that U.S. exporters need assistance with financing to ""level the playing field"" suggests that they lack advantages among the multitude of factors that inform the purchasing decision. Moreover, the fact that less than 2 percent of U.S. export value goes through export promotion agencies suggests this rationale for Ex-Im is bogus.



There is a way to bring foreign subsidies under control, however. The United States should allow Ex-Im to expire at the end of this month and then announce plans to bring cases to the World Trade Organization against governments operating their export credit agencies in violation of agreed upon limits under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. The combination of the carrot of U.S. withdrawal from the business of export credit financing and the stick of WTO litigation would likely incent other governments to reduce, and possibly eliminate, their own subsidy programs.



 **Conclusion**



Most of the rationales for keeping the Export-Import Bank are merely rationalizations that don't stand up to close scrutiny. Perhaps most problematic are the costs imposed, often on unwitting victims. Ex-Im subsidies to particular exporters may help those companies succeed, but they impose significant costs on other firms in the same industry and firms in downstream industries. Accordingly, Ex-Im penalizes many smaller, dynamic, up-and-coming businesses that are often the well springs of new ideas, better mousetraps, and smarter business practices and which the economy needs to spawn subsequent generations of businesses in perpetuity.



That evolutionary process underlies the strength of the U.S. economy, and is essential to U.S. success going forward. On the other hand, U.S. economic strength is undermined when subsidies are deployed in a spiraling race with other nations to the detriment of the next crop of leading U.S. businesses. Let the Export-Import Bank expire.

Another presidential election, another proposal for mandatory national “service.” This time, two Democratic candidates hope to turbocharge their otherwise dubious electoral prospects by proposing to draft all young people to spend a year or two working for Washington’s political elite.



That’s not how they put it, of course. But that is what the national service movement is about.





Sorry Pete Buttigieg, but government conscription is unconstitutional and poorly thought through.



Service, real service to real people, is baked into Americans’ DNA. Alexis de Tocqueville, the great French classical liberal, cited civic activism as one of the new republic’s distinguishing characteristics in his famous _Democracy in America_. He wrote: “I have seen Americans making great and sincere sacrifices for the key common good, and a hundred times I have noticed that, when needs be, they almost always gave each other faithful support.” The resulting vibrant civil society was very different from the enervating monarchies and aristocracies that still dominated Europe. This commitment to service permeated the nation—transforming people, creating institutions, and strengthening America.



But some commentators and politicians view private action as inadequate. Instead, they believe, “service” should be organized, planned, and managed by the state. The fount of modern thought on national service remains _Looking Backward_ , the 1888 publication of lawyer and journalist Edward Bellamy, which envisioned compulsory employment for men and women between the ages of 21 and 45.



A couple decades later, philosopher William James issued an essay, “The Moral Equivalent of War.” In it, he argued that “the martial virtues, although originally gained by the race through war, are absolute and permanent human goods,” and that national service provided a method for instilling those values during peacetime. He wrote: “Our gilded youths would be drafted off to get the childishness knocked out of them, and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas.”



Today his essay is almost entirely forgotten, except for the title. But a host of philosophers, policy analysts, and politicians proffer their own very different proposals for “the moral equivalent of war.” These plans rarely reflect a shared consensus of the national or public interest. More often, they involve blatant social engineering for ideological ends. For instance, sociologist Margaret Mead advocated a universal program that “would replace for girls, even more than for boys, marriage as the route away from the parental home.”



Compulsion was essential to such proposals. In 1979, the Committee for the Study of National Service declared:



International comparisons also fire some American imaginations. Millions of young people serve social needs in China as a routine part of growing up, many [are] commanded to leave the crowded cities and to assist in the countryside. Castro fought illiteracy and mosquitoes in Cuba with units of youth. Interesting combinations of education, work, and service to society are a part of the experience of youth in Israel, Jamaica, Nigeria, Tanzania, and other nations. The civic spirit being imbued in youth elsewhere in the world leaves some Americans wondering and worrying about Saturday‐​night‐​fever, unemployment, the new narcissism, and other afflictions of American youth.



Admittedly, seeing Mao’s Red Guards as a model for America appears dated at best. But current national service advocates similarly seek to transform society. They envision their program providing job training and employment, encouraging social equality, promoting tolerance and civic‐​mindedness, expanding access to college, engendering patriotism, and addressing ubiquitous “unmet social needs.” The idea sounds great. But in practice it is dangerous nonsense.



First to join the ranks of national service advocates was South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who complained about America’s lack of “social cohesion.” What to do? Why, force everyone to work together, of course! Voila, “social cohesion”! In his defense, Buttigieg was just ambiguous enough to allow himself to wriggle out of a political tight spot. He explained on MSNBC: “One thing we could do that would change that [inadequate social cohesion] would be to make it, if not legally obligatory, but certainly a social norm that anybody, after they’re 18, spends a year in national service.”



The problem is that a lack of compulsion ensures that Buttigieg’s plan will fail. There will always be 18‐​year‐​olds who will resist even a purported “social norm.” Yet for national service advocates, such resisters are precisely those most in need of civilizing “service,” meaning political projects mandated by the social engineers in Washington. Those suffering from “Saturday night fever, unemployment, the new narcissism, and other afflictions of American youth” don’t realize that they are sick and therefore must be forcibly cured.



John Delaney would unashamedly drop any ambiguity. Polling at less than 1 percent makes presidential candidates say the damnedest things. He tweeted: “It’s time to bring the country together, to restore our sense of shared purpose and rebuild a common and inclusive national destiny. That’s why we need mandatory national service.” Every 18‐​year‐​old would have to work for Uncle Sam for at least a year, “no exceptions.”



It is a remarkably dumb idea. First, there’s the constitutional problem—the 13th Amendment clearly proscribes “involuntary servitude,” the foundation of Delaney’s program. Moreover, as worthy as it might be to encourage others to “begin their adult lives serving their country and working alongside people from different backgrounds,” that is a bad reason for what amounts to enslavement. National service requires punishing people—presumably by arresting and jailing them—for resisting the state’s social engineering.



Under Delaney’s plan, conscripts, conveniently excluding people his or Buttigieg’s age, would choose between serving in the military, “a new expanded Community Service program,” “a new National infrastructure Apprenticeship program,” and “a newly created Climate Corps.” Conceptually, there’s nothing particularly new in his proposal. But subjugating people to provide cheap labor for politically inspired projects is bad both in principle and practice.



First, the military doesn’t want conscripts or short‐​termers. The armed services learned during the Vietnam War that those who don’t want to be there tend to develop discipline problems, have little interest in training and education, refuse to take greater responsibility, and won’t re‐​up and populate a career NCO corps. Moreover, one year of military service is a spectacular waste: just as someone gets trained, he or she leaves.



Second, “community service”—cleaning hospital bedpans, shelving library books, and whatever else moves interest groups and legislators—is valuable but not national, and moral but only if not coerced. There is no such thing as compulsory compassion. It is hard to think of a worse abuse of government power than to arrest and jail someone for not showing up to “tutor disadvantaged children,” one of Delaney’s approved projects.



Third, “infrastructure apprenticeship,” meaning cleaning up parks and improving federal buildings, is not “service” in any meaningful sense. The government can easily hire workers for such jobs. Coercing people to perform such tasks isn’t going to morally uplift anyone.



Fourth, the “Climate Corps” is more of the same, namely assisting “in clean energy projects, including solar installation, improving building efficiency, developing community gardens, and increasing awareness about sustainable practices.” Apparently running for president has left Delaney almost completely disconnected from American life. Companies send people door‐​to‐​door to sell products that cut energy use. Firms fiercely compete to install solar panels on private homes and in commercial operations. People freely create community gardens in their neighborhoods without the assistance of federal conscripts. And there’s plenty of lobbying for “sustainable practices.” You don’t need to threaten to arrest people to force them into the PR business.



Perhaps the biggest problem with national service is that neither Delaney nor Buttigieg nor anyone else seems to understand the opportunity costs. That is, drafting people to plant gardens, pick up trash, smile at hospital patients, manage food kitchens, and improve federal facilities costs whatever else the draftees would otherwise be doing: completing their education, helping family members in need, contributing to their communities in their own way, preparing for economically and socially valuable careers, and otherwise using their skills to better meet human needs. Having politicians assign people to an arbitrary mix of tasks, virtually none of which are vital in any sense, is guaranteed to be a grand waste of money, time, and talent.



Delaney wants to “restore our sense of shared purpose and a common and inclusive national destiny.” That’s a wonderful objective with which most people would agree. But corralling millions into his pet programs and jailing recalcitrant 18‐​year‐​olds who don’t share his vision is no answer to anything. Such a program—with older men and women safely beyond its reach, free to blame young people for America’s problems—would breed cynicism and hostility, not “service and patriotism.”



America faces serious challenges. But most of them have no political solution. “We need big transformational change to stop America from dividing any further,” argues Delaney. Then let him persuade his fellow citizens to voluntarily join him in making that transformational change. Americans need more service, not national “service.”

The transition from socialism to the market economy produced a divide between those who advocated rapid, or “big‐​bang” reforms, and those who advocated a gradual approach. More than 25 years have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, providing ample empirical data to test those approaches. Evidence shows that early and rapid reformers by far outperformed gradual reformers, both on economic measures such as GDP per capita and on social indicators such as the United Nations Human Development Index.



A key argument for gradualism was that too‐​rapid reforms would cause great social pain. In reality, rapid reformers experienced shorter recessions and recovered much earlier than gradual reformers. Indeed a much broader measure of well‐​being, the Human Development Index, points to the same conclusion: the social costs of transition in rapidly reforming countries were lower.



Moreover, the advocates of gradualism argued that institutional development should precede market liberalization, thus increasing the latter’s effectiveness. In a strict sense, it is impossible to disprove this argument, for no post‐​communist country followed that sequence of events. In all post‐​communist countries, institutional development lagged considerably behind economic reforms. Waiting for institutional development before implementing economic reforms could easily have become a prescription for no reforms at all.



However, after 25 years, rapid reformers ended up with better institutions than gradual reformers. This outcome is consistent with the hypothesis that political elites who were committed to economic liberalization were also committed to subsequent institutional development. Conversely, political elites that advocated gradual reforms often did so in order to extract maximum rents from the economy. One extreme consequence of gradualism was the formation of oligarchic classes.



When it comes to the speed and depth of reforms, the relative position of countries has remained largely unchanged. Most countries that moved ahead early are still farthest ahead.



More than 25 years have passed since the fall of communism. That span of time provides researchers with an enormous amount of information about the transition experiences of nearly 30 countries. It also allows for a much fuller analysis of moves from authoritarianism and central planning to democracy and market economics than had been possible in the past. This paper looks at those experiences and addresses the following questions:



What happened?



Why did the transition happen the way it did?



Whither transition in the future?



Before proceeding, a few clarifying remarks are in order. First, it is important to be careful with oversimplified terminology. For obvious reasons, popular writings discuss transition as a change from socialism to capitalism. To understand what had to change, what did change, and the sequencing of different reforms, we must first consider the most important political and economic characteristics of the countries in the ""socialist camp.""



A socialist state is characterized by authoritarianism and one-party rule. National assets are almost entirely state-owned. There is a virtual prohibition on individual market activity (large-scale buying and selling is a criminal act labelled as ""speculation"" in the pejorative sense of the word) and the economy is run by central planners. Transition, therefore, means a change away from these characteristics. China, for example, moved extensively, but not fully, toward private ownership and market forces, while doing little in terms of democratization. At the other extreme are the CEB countries, which embraced both free markets and democracy. Russia, Ukraine, and others ended up somewhere in the middle — with partial democratization, considerable private ownership, and a very incomplete market competition.



While this complexity may seem to pose a problem for analysis, there exists a reasonable quantitative metric called the Transition Progress Index (TPI), produced by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The TPI is measured on a scale from 1 to 4.3, with 1 representing ""little or no change from a rigid centrally planned economy and 4.3 represent[ing] the standards of an industrialized market economy.""1



Second, many of the more judgmental writings on transition do not use the TPI or any other quantitative indicator, but oversimplify relevant terminologies and concepts. Perhaps the most surprising example of this oversimplification is the well-known critique of transition by the Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, who argued in 1999 that early and rapid reforms greatly harmed the social fabric in Russia. The only yardstick that Stiglitz used to argue that Russia was indeed a rapid reformer was its deeply flawed process of privatization.2



As we show later, apart from privatization of state-owned assets, Russian reforms were far _less_ rapid than those in the CEB — a fact consistent with alternative interpretations of the Russian transition. For example, Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister who presided over Russia's early moves toward the free market, argued that the huge social costs imposed on the Russian population were not due to rapid reforms, but due to slow or nonexistent reforms.3



In a similar vein, it is often claimed that the decline in the GDP and hence, standard of living, was larger than that during the Great Depression. Here statistics seem to show the GDP figures falling by huge percentages — between 25 percent and 50 percent from the pre-transition high in 1989. According to some estimates, in countries such as present-day Ukraine, GDP is supposed to be only about 90 percent of what it had been before the transition. Anyone who remembers Ukraine in 1989 and saw the country change over the next 25 years will not believe that for a moment.



There are two important reasons why GDP estimates exaggerate the post-communist decline and underestimate the subsequent growth. The Soviet measure of output (the so-called ""Net Material Product"") overstated real values due to the well-known distortions of the communist system of central planning. By contrast, current estimates understate GDP because they omit underground economic activities.4



Third, we must be aware of inertia in the transition literature. Many studies have tended to view the effects of transition in a relatively negative light, pointing to the decline of GDP, substantial deterioration of living standards, and a considerable widening of the income-distribution gap. The early and inevitable costs of transition were best described by the Hungarian economist Janos Kornai in 1994.5 As Kornai argued, a recession would be necessary before a new market system could deliver benefits because of the ""soft-budget"" system, whereby any factory losses were automatically paid for from the state budget. As a result of the soft-budget system, ex-communist economies were overindustrialized, highly inefficient, and subject to considerable overemployment in the form of nonproductive labor.



Kornai's views were widely discussed by scholars. Surely, therefore, a period of deterioration after the collapse of communism was thus to be expected. Researchers should have understood that studies covering only the early years of transition were bound to show only the ""bad"" part of Kornai's cycle. As time went on, economies in ex-communist countries improved, and comprehensive reviews of transition became more positive. By then, however, the transition process became less interesting to both the public and academics. Hence, rather unfortunately, the early writings remained better known and the somewhat negative perception of the transition process persists to the present day. Thus, Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics writes in his _Capital in the Twenty-First Century_ , ""The Asian financial crisis . . . convinced many countries including Indonesia, Brazil and Russia that the policies known as ‘shock therapies' dictated by the international community were not always well advised.""6



A major purpose of this paper is to correct misperceptions created by what were surely premature analyses of the early 1990s.



Conclusions of earlier reviews, which began to appear in the mid-1990s, pointed to a sharp decline in GDP and were quite negative. In 1996, Peter Murrell of the University of Maryland noted the increased poverty in transition countries.7 In 1996, Mathias Dewatripont of the Université Libre de Bruxelles and Gérard Roland of the University of California — Berkeley, came to a similar conclusion.8 In 1998, Branko Milanovic from the World Bank wrote about the sharp widening of income distribution.9 Also in 1998, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) noted a decline in the overall standard of living.10 All were concerned that big-bang reforms were too harsh and caused massive social pain.



In 1999, Joseph Stiglitz, then chief economist at the World Bank, spearheaded this new criticism of the so-called Washington Consensus. The term ""Washington Consensus"" refers to a set of economic policy prescriptions for developing countries promoted by Washington, D.C.–based institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department. The policy prescriptions included macroeconomic stabilization, liberalization of trade and investment, and the expansion of competition within the domestic economy.11 As Stiglitz argued, ""big-bang,"" or rapid and deep reforms, should give way to a more gradual liberalization that would ease the pain of transition. He further argued in favor of institutional development. He was particularly emphatic with regard to Russia, where he saw big-bang reforms leading to great political turmoil. However, it is significant that even he and other strong critics of the big-bang approach to reforms did accept the primacy of financial stabilization, which formed a major part of the International Monetary Fund's transition programs.12



Overall, studies done in the 1990s concluded that early and rapid reformers were causing undue social pain and that big-bang reforms needed to be reconsidered. In the following section, we will review those criticisms on the basis of 25 years' of evidence.



Following the start of the new millennium, new analyses began to tell a somewhat less negative story. Already in 1999, Milanovic noted that deteriorating income distribution and poverty rates were not nearly as bad in CEB as in the countries further to the east and south. In 2002, Jan Svejnar of Columbia University was also concerned about social pain in the early years of transition, but argued that it was far less severe in CEB.13 He concluded that the superior performance of the CEB countries may have been related to early and rapid reforms. Importantly, Svejnar also added that CEB's economic performance was much better than that in the former Soviet Union (FSU) countries. In many CEB countries, GDP recovered as early as 1993 and 1994. Foreign investments began to flow in by the mid-1990s, and export growth and diversification to Western Europe were both evident by that time as well.14



In 2003, Leszek Balcerowicz, who presided over the early Polish reforms as deputy prime minister and minister of finance, was among the first economists to argue that CEB performed better not because of luck, geographic location, or accession talks with the EU, but because the CEB undertook early financial stabilization and rapid and resolute market liberalization. In a word, CEB pursued the big-bang strategy.15 Another of the key architects of rapid reform, Václav Klaus, who was the minister of finance of Czechoslovakia and later prime minister and president of the Czech Republic, made a similar case in 2006.16 Analyzing 15 years of data, Havrylyshyn concluded in a study in 2007 that countries that undertook early and rapid reforms achieved the best results.17



The critics of the big-bang, however, remained unconvinced. By the middle of the first decade of the new millennium, transition was so close to completion (at least in the CEB countries) that the excitement among social scientists about this singularly unique historical experiment had waned. Thus, the audience for newer studies was quite small. Furthermore, some of the stars of the transition process, such as Estonia and Latvia, were hit hard by the Great Recession. And strangely, big-bang reforms in Poland were not credited for the fact that Poland emerged from the Great Recession unscathed.



In spite of the availability of conventional statistics and the newer category of quantitative indicators of institutional quality (including ratings of democracy, corruption, and the rule of law), it is surprising and unfortunate how superficially quantitative indicators have been used in the literature. Sometimes, the literature even confuses quantitative indicators of progress toward a market economy with those of economic performance. To avoid similar misinterpretations, we make a clear distinction between ""input"" variables, or policies that moved countries from central planning to the market system, and ""output"" variables, or actual economic performance results. The correlation between input variables and output variables will allow for the most objective testing of various hypotheses about the optimal transition strategy.



As discussed, the TPI measures progress toward a market economy in such areas as privatization of large-scale and small-scale enterprises, price liberalization, trade and foreign exchange liberalizations, interest-rate liberalization, banking and competition policies, and others.18 While imperfect, the TPI is broadly accepted by transition specialists as a reasonable indicator of the relative position of transition countries on the path toward the free market. Happily, the data goes back all the way to 1989 (see Figure 1).



Since Figure 1 may be a little too busy to follow differences among countries, we have divided transition countries into groups. These groups are based on their speed of transition in the first few years after the collapse of communism (see Table 1, ""Transition Countries Grouped by Early Reform Strategies"" Table 1). Countries that increased their score by at least one point in the first three to four years are grouped as rapid reformers. Clearly, Poland, Czechoslovakia (later the Czech Republic and Slovakia), and Hungary belong in that group.



Croatia and Slovenia, which started from a more advanced position because of a lower level of centralization in the former Yugoslavia, did not increase their score as early as the four Central European countries, but caught up to the rapid reformers by 1995. Hence Croatia and Slovenia should also be considered rapid reformers.



Following the dissolution of the USSR in 1991, the three Baltic countries quickly caught up with Central Europe and should also be counted as rapid reformers. The other FSU countries reformed more slowly and at varying speeds. The EBRD score of the laggards (Belarus, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan), for example, has never exceeded 2.5.



A special case that has caused a lot of misunderstanding is Russia. Its huge leap forward between 1991 and 1994 approximates that of Poland, but Russia's transition was not sustained. Yegor Gaidar's 1992 reforms soon ran into opposition and he was removed from government. Some of his reforms were eventually reversed. For that reason, Russia is categorized in Table 1 as an ""aborted big-bang"" country. Unfortunately, much of the writing about Russia does not recognize that the big-bang reforms were short-lived and then reversed.



In Figure 1, the graph on the top indicates the transition progress of Central European, Southeast European, and Baltic countries. The graph on the bottom indicates the transition progress in the rest of the former USSR.19



Several characteristics of the transformation process are worth noting. First, there was a wide divergence among countries. Most countries started at the lowest level of 1.0 (with Hungary and Yugoslavia in slight lead because of a lower level of centralization). By 1995, the transition values spread widely and that widening tendency has continued to the present. While Poland's big-bang reforms were the first among transition countries, the rest of Central Europe and the Baltics caught up with Poland by the middle of the 1990s. Within the FSU, Ukraine stands out as an early laggard, delaying any reforms until 1994, although Georgia was also quite slow in starting its reforms. In contrast, Belarus under Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich started to reform earlier than Ukraine. In 1994, however, Alyaksandr Lukashenko became Belarusian president and led the country back to an essentially Soviet economic regime.



 **Figure 1. Progress toward a Market Economy in Ex-communist Countries**  




Despite some notable special cases, the broad pattern of transition for different groups of countries was established in the first years after the fall of communism and has largely held to the present day. This pattern is best reflected in Figure 2, where we have slightly modified the groupings from Table 1, ""Transition Countries Grouped by Early Reform Strategies""Table 1. We separated Central European and Baltic countries because the Baltic countries were a part of the USSR and started the transition process slightly later than Central Europe. Apart from the two Yugoslav economies of Croatia and Slovenia, which we have grouped with Central Europe, the rest of South-East Europe started to transition much later. That was partly due to the Yugoslav wars and partly due to policy decisions.

 **Note:** CE = Central European; SEE = Southeast European; FSUREF = Former Soviet Union, gradual reforms; FSULAG = Former Soviet Union, lagged reforms.



By 2013, as Figure 3 shows, Bulgaria and Romania improved greatly. That was probably because of the effects of the EU accession talks that we will discuss later. Figure 3 also confirms the distinction between the nine former Soviet republics that undertook gradual, but real, reforms (FSUREF), and those former Soviet republics where reforms lagged (FSULAG). One of the main conclusions of this paper is that speed and outcomes of transition were largely set in the early 1990s. Countries that started early generally continued to move forward. They remain leading achievers to this day.



 **Figure 3. Transition Scores of Countries by Group and Rank in 2013**  




Let us now turn to democratization. There are many quantitative measures of democratization, but they all show similar patterns. Figure 4, for example, shows data from the American nongovernmental organization Freedom House, which ranks political freedom around the world on a scale from one (most free) to seven (least free). Two key observations merit attention. First, Central European and Baltic countries saw the most dramatic improvements in terms of political freedom. Conversely, political freedom in the laggard countries is worse than in the dying days of communism.



 **Figure 4. Freedom Rating by Country Groups, 1990–2013**  




Second, the ordering of country groups by democratization mirrors the ordering of country groups by market liberalization. As Gérard Roland and Daniel Treisman from the University of California–Los Angeles show, there is a close correlation between the two processes.20



Let's now look at institutional development. The World Bank's World Governance Indicators and Doing Business Reports, and Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, offer a full look at institutional development in transition countries. But the EBRD's data on institutional development has the great advantage of being available for a much longer period of time. Analysts might be comforted by the high correlation among all the indexes during the times when it can be measured. Using the EBRD data, therefore, we have constructed a comparison between market liberalization and institutional development.



In Figure 5, ""Economic Liberalization"" denotes progress made by ex-communist countries in the areas of small-scale privatization, price liberalization, and trade and foreign exchange liberalizations. ""Institutional Development"" denotes progress made by ex-communist countries in the areas of large-scale privatization, enterprise restructuring and governance, competition policy, banking reform, and reform of securities markets and nonbank financial institutions.



The critics of the big-bang approach to reform have often pointed to the lack of attention paid to institutional development. Many have gone further, saying that institutions should have come first to ensure that liberalized markets functioned most efficiently. We will look at that debate below.



In the meantime, data shows that even the leaders in institutional development have not come close to achieving scores in this area as impressive as they have achieved in the area of market liberalization. To give one example, in 2010 the Baltic countries, which performed the best in terms of economic liberalization out of all the ex-communist countries, scored the maximum 4.3. But that year the Baltics only scored 3.54 out of the possible 4.3 in terms of institutional development.



 **Figure 5. Comparison between Market Liberalization and Institutional Development**  




Nonetheless, the countries that moved fastest on institutional reforms were the very same countries that also moved fastest on market liberalization, even if the two types of reform progressed at unequal rates. Importantly, countries that delayed market liberalization did not move faster in terms of institutional development. There was no apparent trade-off between them. Thus we continue to see the ordering of country groups established at the outset. Countries that led in terms of economic liberalization also led in terms of democratization and even institutional development.



Today, a vast array of much more sophisticated institutional indicators exists. Let us look at some of them. Figures 6 and 7 show the average rule of law scores of our country groupings as measured by the World Bank's World Governance Indicators, and the extent of corruption as measured by Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index.



The corruption indicator is not an input per se. Rather, it is an output. However, corruption reflects a vast array of economic and legal changes — with good policies resulting in minimal corruption and bad policies leading to extensive corruption. As World Bank researchers have recognized, therefore, corruption is a good proxy for overall institutional quality.21



Once again, we find that early leaders in market liberalization performed better than other countries on measures of institutional quality. Within each group, we see some variation, of course. Thus Croatia scores far below the Central European average. That said, the country's overall trend is positive. In the 1990s, Croatia's institutional quality was similar to that of other Southeast European countries. By 2007, Croatia's institutional quality was far superior to that in the rest of Southeast Europe as well as the FSU countries.



When it comes to the Baltic countries, all were close to each other from the beginning of transition, even though Estonia was always in the lead. In the FSUREF group, Georgia has improved the most following the Rose Revolution in 2003. That was dramatically reflected in Georgia's rankings in the Doing Business and Corruption Perceptions Indexes. In the former, Georgia rose from 112th place in 2006 to 37th place the following year. In the latter, Georgia moved from 134th place in 2004 to 51st place in 2012 — ahead of some EU countries. Moldova had the second-most improved institutional environment.



 **Figure 6. World Bank's Rule of Law Indicator by Country Group, 1996–2010**  




The Corruption Perception Index tells the same story. The CEB did much better from the start and continued to improve. The FSUREF countries show limited improvement throughout the transition period. Indeed, there was a slight tendency in some countries to worsen after 2000 (e.g., Russia and Ukraine). As for the FSULAG countries, Figure 7 shows an anomalous improvement between 1998 and 2002, but that improvement may have been due to a measurement error.22 Whatever the explanation, after 2000 these lagging and very authoritarian countries continued to score very poorly on corruption.



 **Figure 7. Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index by Country Group, 1998–2011**  




Here we start by looking at the change in GDP per capita for the entire sample of 29 transition countries.23 Some have argued that rising incomes do not tell the full story. Income inequality, for example, rose as well. As such, we will look at both income distribution and other proposed measures of social well-being.



igure 8 shows the evolution of GDP per capita in constant 2011 U.S. dollars adjusted for purchasing power parity for different groups of transition countries between 1990 and 2015. The similarity between Figure 2, which traces market liberalization, and Figure 8, which traces income, is striking. Clearly, countries which moved early and rapidly on market liberalization (and we now know from Figure 5 that they also moved fastest on institutional development) also performed the best on GDP per capita. In addition to including Poland and Ukraine in their respective groups of countries, we have included them as standalone countries. The contrast between rapid and gradual reformers is striking. As we have already noted, Ukraine delayed any reforms for a number of years and then embraced only gradual change. As we explain later, postponement of reform proved to be an opening for rent-seeking and the rise of oligarchs. The Ukrainian example is significant not only because of the current visibility of Ukraine, but also because it shows what happens when reforms are postponed. As noted, Ukrainians (especially of the younger generation) see a big difference in performance between their country and the CEB group. They seem to relate Ukraine's poor performance to too few reforms, rather than to too many reforms.



 **Figure 8. GDP per Capita by Country Group, 1990–2015 (in 2011 U.S. Dollars Adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity)**  




In addition to including Poland and Ukraine in their respective groups of countries, we have included them as standalone countries. The contrast between rapid and gradual reformers is striking. As we have already noted, Ukraine delayed any reforms for a number of years and then embraced only gradual change. As we explain later, postponement of reform proved to be an opening for rent-seeking and the rise of oligarchs. The Ukrainian example is significant not only because of the current visibility of Ukraine, but also because it shows what happens when reforms are postponed. As noted, Ukrainians (especially of the younger generation) see a big difference in performance between their country and the CEB group. They seem to relate Ukraine's poor performance to too few reforms, rather than to too many reforms.



Of course, skeptics would not be incorrect to point out that so far we have only given a post hoc, ergo propter hoc argument in favor of rapid reforms. In fact, early econometric studies, including a 1996 paper by Stanley Fischer, Ratna Sahay, and Carlos Vegh of the International Monetary Fund, found that reforms had a strong effect on economic growth — as did good institutions.24 Treisman confirmed those early findings in 2014.25



Let us now turn to foreign direct investment (FDI). Ordinarily, countries that attract more FDI per capita do so because of a better investment climate. Such countries will then benefit from higher economic growth and strong export performance. Table 2, ""Cumulative FDI Inflows by Country Group, 1989–2012""Table 2 shows that the more reform-oriented country groups achieved much higher FDI inflows. The values shown are not annual. Instead, they show a cumulative total since the ex-communist countries opened up to global trade and investment. The differences between countries are overwhelming, with the two reformist blocs receiving much more than the rest of the ex-communist countries.



The similarity between the amount of FDI flowing into gradual reformers and laggards may seem surprising. A large part of the explanation rests with Turkmenistan's enormous gas reserves. As always, petroleum attracts large investments, notwithstanding the nature of the political regime. And that raised the FSULAG average. In a strange contrast, Russia has received little FDI, in spite of having large petroleum reserves. That happened because Russia has pursued a policy of maximizing state control over the oil reserves and also because Russia does not provide an attractive investment climate for its very large, and relatively advanced, manufacturing sectors.



 **Table 2. Cumulative FDI Inflows by Country Group, 1989–2012**  




There is also a high degree of correlation between market liberalization and export performance. According to a 2005 study by Harry Broadman of the World Bank, rapid reformers were fastest in reaching ""normal"" trade-to-GDP ratios.26



Let us now turn to the social outcomes of transition. Observers of the transition process will recall the heated discussions about the social pain that rapid reforms were supposed to have caused and the soul-searching about the optimal transition strategy to follow. Thus Adam Przeworski, an expert on Latin American democracy, wrestled with what he saw as a potential inconsistency between democracy and rapid economic reforms. The Przeworski hypothesis stated that rapid economic reforms would inevitably cause a lot of pain to the population. Given the newly established democratic decisionmaking, the reformist governments, Przeworski reasoned, would lose in the next elections and economic reforms would be reversed or at least halted. As we explain in the next section of this paper, Przeworski's hypothesis was only half right.27



Now consider three specific social indicators: inequality, poverty ratios, and the United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI). Table 3 summarizes, by country groups, the trends in inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient measures the income distribution among country's residents. The coefficient ranges from zero, which indicates complete equality (i.e., everyone's incomes are perfectly equal) to one, which indicates complete inequality (i.e., one person has all the income in the country). Note first that the Gini coefficient in the socialist camp was much lower than in most market economies — with a partial exception of the Nordic countries. But it is also notable that the Gini coefficient was higher in the FSU than in Central Europe. While the official Soviet estimates implied a Gini coefficient in the low .20s, scholars found that these were largely based on urban estimates. Searching through internal writings by Soviet academics, scholars have discovered that rural and low-income regions had a much wider income distribution.



 **Table 3. Trends in the Gini Coefficient by Country Group**  




Table 3 includes adjusted figures for the FSU. Clearly, all transition countries saw a widening of income distribution. That was to be expected, given the earlier artificial suppression of different outcomes and the lack of capital-based income for individuals. However, the extent of the widening was by far greater in the gradual and lagging reformers. That is consistent with the early finding of Branko Milanovic, who showed in 1999 that the ""worst"" deterioration of income distribution was not in the Central European countries, but in the FSU.28 Moreover, the Gini coefficient has started to shrink in recent years, but less so in the gradual or non-reforming countries.



A similar story can be told by looking at an alternative indicator of distribution of income: the poverty ratio (i.e., the share of the population living on less than $2.00 a day adjusted for inflation and purchasing power parity) (see Figure 9). The differences between rapid reformers on the one hand, and gradualists and laggards on the other hand, are dramatic. All ex-communist countries saw some worsening at the outset of the post-communist recession that lasted from about 1990 to about 1995. All experienced a return to lower poverty ratios. But the gap between country groups is far greater than was the case with the Gini coefficient. The Central European and Baltic countries, and even the countries in Southeast Europe, saw their poverty ratios remain at very low levels, while both FSU groups peaked at more than 40 percent before falling back again, although gradualists and laggards have yet to match the other groups by this measure. This evidence strongly confirms the view that rapid reforms caused less — not more — transitional poverty than gradual reforms.



 **Figure 9. Poverty Ratio at Two Dollars per Capita per Day by Country Group**  




An even more compelling piece of evidence for the last conclusion comes from the UNDP's Human Development Index. Like all subjective or composite indices that have become common over time, the HDI has its problems. Still, the HDI provides a fuller picture of human well-being than GDP per capita alone. Thus, in addition to GDP per capita, the HDI includes measures of life expectancy and education.



When it comes to social conditions, all transition countries suffered some initial deterioration as incomes fell and unemployment rose. But this deterioration was quite minimal in Central Europe. By the mid 1990s, HDI was on the rise again. Once again, the Baltic countries performed better than other ex-Soviet countries. By 2000, reforming countries reached their pre-transition levels. In contrast, the HDI in FSUREF countries only started to recover in 2000, while HDI in FSULAG countries continued to fall until at least 2005 (see Table 4).



To sum up, different measures of ""outputs,"" covering many dimensions of economic, political, and social life, consistently point in the same direction — early and rapid reformers outperformed those countries that moved more gradually.



 **Table 4. The Human Development Index, 1990–2012**  




The only significant anomaly concerns the relative performance of the three FSULAG countries compared to the FSUREF countries. A literal interpretation of the positive correlation between reforms and performance would imply worse performance among the laggards than among gradual reformers. After all, FSULAG progress toward the market was even slower than that of FSUREF. The slightly better economic performance of the laggards remains one of the still-unresolved puzzles of the transition period. Many writers have suggested possible explanations. Turkmenistan, for example, has large gas reserves that can pay for the policy mistakes of the Turkmen government. Belarus receives direct and implicit subsidies from Russia amounting to between 10 percent and 20 percent of GDP. Even then, however, Russian subsidies do not fully resolve the Belarusian puzzle. Still, these very special cases are not enough to undermine the overall trend.



Let us now sum up our main findings. The first key finding is that, with the exception of Belarus, all the non-Asian post-communist transition economies have moved a long way from centrally planned socialist regimes towards market-based capitalist systems. Indeed, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania can be said to have completed their transitions. Gérard Roland and the EBRD differ from the above assessment by pointing to lagging institutional development in Central Europe and the Baltic countries.29 We will tum to this issue below.



Second, the EBRD data shows sharp divergence between the most advanced countries and the slower reformers. While all ex-communist countries started from about the same position (that is, very far from a market economy), by the mid-1990s the differences among them were huge and kept growing. It is important to note that the gap grew because countries that led from the start continued to move resolutely forward, while the gradualists moved less quickly.



Third, the basic pattern — of who led the reform process and who lagged behind — was set within the first four to five years. It has stayed that way ever since, with, perhaps, one significant exception: Georgia has been steadily catching up after its 2003 Rose Revolution.30 Because of their late start due to the Yugoslav wars, several of the former Yugoslavia states, despite their more market-oriented status at the beginning of the 1990s, were surpassed by the gradual reformers of the FSU. But once the wars stopped, the ex-Yugoslav countries moved faster in an effort to catch up to the transition leaders in Central Europe and the Baltics.



Fourth, institutional development in ex-communist countries did, in fact, lag behind economic liberalization. However, no country has followed the recommendation of the advocates of gradualism and put in place good institutions before liberalizing (although many leaders in the gradual and lagging countries explained the delays by saying that they must first develop good institutions). Thus, the leaders of both Belarus and Uzbekistan have frequently stated that their aim was a so-called ""social market economy"" and that the first stage of this process involved development of conditions in which markets can function properly. From the late 1990s, some countries started to move a little faster in terms of institutional development, but those countries were not gradualist. In fact, countries that moved the fastest and farthest in terms of institutional development turned out to be the very same countries that had moved earliest and most forcefully in terms of market liberalization.



Fifth, the CEB countries that led in market liberalization have also followed a consistent path to democratization. This is important because democratization and economic transformation are linked. In sharp contrast to the CEB countries, the FSUREF countries implemented only partial democratization. Most of the FSUREF members started to revert to authoritarianism. In the FSULAG, this lack of democratization was fairly explicit and extreme. For the FSUREF, it was more subtle, with a formal electoral process legally permitting many parties. In practice, democracy was so restricted by the incumbent government that it came to be labelled by political scientists as ""managed democracy."" This failure to democratize and the excesses of the oligarchs led in many countries to popular resentment, demonstrations, and the so-called ""color revolutions."" A number of these color revolutions initially succeeded — at least to the extent of overthrowing the existing governments in Serbia (2000), Georgia (2003), Ukraine (2004), and the Kyrgyz Republic (2005). However, only in Georgia did the color revolution lead to real changes in the economic direction of the country.



Sixth, transition in some countries has led to the rise of an oligarchic class, which uses nontransparent means to influence policy, protects its monopoly-like status, and impedes a truly open and competitive market economy. The use of money in market economies for lobbying in order to obtain special treatment with regard to taxes, licenses, and exemptions is well-known historically and internationally. Oligarchic support for favored political parties or entities is also not unique to ex-communist countries. What troubles a lot of observers of transition is that oligarchs in ex-communist countries go far beyond the usual rent-seeking activities and use their influence to determine the general philosophical direction of government, reform policies, and geostrategic decisions.31



There is some evidence that oligarchies are stronger in countries that followed gradual and slow reforms. For example, the Baltic countries and CEE have 0.11 and 0.255 billionaires per million inhabitants, respectively. The FSUREF region, in contrast, has 0.485 billionaires per million inhabitants, or twice as many as those in CEE. Delays in liberalization, in other words, seemed to have allowed for stronger oligarchy formation and entrenchment.32



Seventh,""inputs and output"" are positively correlated. Countries that did the most to liberalize achieved the highest GDP per capita increases, experienced the least widening income distribution, suffered the lowest poverty ratio increase, and achieved the best scores in the HDI. It should also be noted that non-GDP performance more or less mirrored GDP performance. That is to say, all countries that saw a decline in output in their first years experienced a worsening of welfare and a widening of the income gap between rich and poor. Yet as soon as GDP recovery began, social deterioration stopped. Since the early reformers were the first to experience a recovery of economic output, they also experienced the least social costs. They were additionally the first to enjoy the benefits of transition — higher income, an end to shortages, access to a wide variety of goods, and improved quality of goods.



The most important question facing ex-communist nations was whether to opt for gradual or rapid reforms. If economic performance is the main measure of success, the data speaks loudly. Countries that moved early and rapidly on reforms have performed far better. Why?



As Anders Åslund of the Atlantic Council, Peter Boone of the London School of Economics, and Simon Johnson of Duke University noted in 1996, notwithstanding the mathematical sophistication and elegance of gradualist models, big-bang reforms worked better because of the political economy in ex-communist countries.33As these authors correctly understood, the former communist elites in gradualist countries generally accepted that a new capitalist regime was inevitable, but they wanted to retain their privileged or ruling status. Soon, they enriched themselves through corrupt privatization schemes. In a word, the gradualist model was too easily abused.



Moreover, rapid reforms, including price liberalization, trade liberalization, and business deregulation, quickly induced resource reallocation from inefficient communist dinosaurs to new firms, and that led to an early recovery of output. Even in Poland and Slovenia, where the privatization of large state enterprises was long delayed, economic recovery came between 1993 and 1994.34 The huge social pain of much longer recessions in the gradualist countries should not be underestimated. Certainly the continued decline of HDI values in the FSU suggests that the social pain was considerable.35



As mentioned, institutional development in big-bang countries lags behind market liberalization, although it trends upward. The extensive literature on the New Institutional Economics (NIE) clearly shows that institutions matter. But they matter more for sustaining growth over the long term than for jumpstarting growth after a recession. So a complete establishment of good institutional structure was not initially needed. That it took centuries, not years, to build institutions in today's advanced market economies is one of the key lessons from the pioneer of the NIE school, the Nobel laureate economist Douglass North.36 Just how much institutional development is needed to restart growth remains an unanswered question, but it is clear that the progress achieved by the mid-1990s in the CEB group was sufficient to sustain a comparatively higher rate of growth (see Figure 5).



The evidence on sequencing also points to the fact that political leaders in gradualist countries may have been less than sincere. In spite of their frequent protestations that going slowly was necessary to allow time to build proper market institutions, nothing of the sort has happened (see Figure 5). There is not a single case of a country where improved institutional quality preceded liberalization.



Critics of rapid reforms contended that the stress on economic fundamentals caused international financial institutions to ignore institutional development. Again, Figure 5 contradicts that contention. The countries that took care of fundamentals early (that is, countries that achieved financial stabilization and market liberalization), also moved earlier and more resolutely in terms of institutional development.



In 2013, Christopher Hartwell of the Center for Social and Economic Research in Warsaw offered a detailed history of the actual sequence of reforms that were followed in ex-communist countries, as well as the nature of the IMF, World Bank, and EBRD advice to the transition countries.37 He made a powerful counterargument against the contention that institutions were ignored. His conclusions support our view that it was not the international financial institutions or big-bang reformers who ignored institutional development, rather, it was the political leadership of the slow-reforming countries that did so.



While the promoters of the so-called Washington Consensus may or may not have had the ability to effectively push institutional development, institutional development was always recognized as an integral part of any reform program.38 Comparing the structure and the timing of the Washington Consensus recommendations with the actual path of reforms that was followed by the big-bang countries suggests that the Washington Consensus was, by and large, applied by the successful top performers.



The concern about lagging institutional development in ex-communist countries has not entirely disappeared. Many recent analyses focus on cases of advanced countries, especially the new EU member states. These analyses suggest that after their accession to the EU, the reformist drive in ex-communist countries waned — especially with regard to institutional development. Figure 5 seemingly justifies such an assessment. While economic liberalization in big-bang countries has almost reached its maximum, institutional development continues to lag behind. Thus in 2013 the EBRD argued that the pace of reforms has sharply declined. A year later, Gérard Roland warned that ""reforms to improve institutions literally stopped in transition countries.""39 That institutional development is not yet complete is an undeniable fact, but the above interpretations of institutional reforms overstate the problem by using the wrong benchmark.



It has been generally recognized by advocates of both gradual and rapid reforms that institutional changes cannot be done as quickly as changes in laws that allow for a more liberal market. North, as mentioned, long ago emphasized that institutional development in advanced countries took a very long time.40 By the late 1990s, EBRD reports explicitly distinguished liberalization components as the ""first generation of reforms"" and institutional development as the ""second generation of reforms."" The second, the EBRD recognized, were more complex legally and politically, and necessarily took more time.41



A better approach to assess the speed and status of institutional developments in big-bang countries is to compare those countries with an appropriate group of non-transition countries. East Asian Tiger economies are relevant for two reasons. First, they are market economies at about the same level of development as CEB countries. Second, they are considered very successful economies that have been among the world's leading export performers. The comparison between the two is presented in Figure 10.



 **Figure 10. Comparison of the Rule of Law in the New EU Member States and East Asian Countries**  




As Figure 10 shows, no matter how fast the CEB countries have moved on institutional development since the EU accession, today the CEB countries are very much in the same range of institutional development as the East Asian Tigers. Only the very mature economies of Singapore and Hong Kong rank higher.



Two additional issues about transition merit a brief consideration — privatization and the role of the EU in sustaining reforms in ex-communist countries. The share of private sector GDP is easy to measure. The CEB countries top the list with over 70 percent, and the SEE countries are not far behind. In the FSUREF countries, private sectors account for between 50 percent and 70 percent of GDP. The FSULAG are far behind, with between 25 percent and 30 percent.



The literature on privatization is large, but as Simeon Djankov of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and Peter Murrell noted in 2002, not easy to interpret.42 There is, for example, no consensus on how precisely to measure the results of privatization. Is it higher profit ratios, greater revenues, or larger productivity increases? Even so, there appears to be a consensus on some very broad and tentative conclusions.43 First, privatization by outsiders outperformed privatization by insiders. Some degree of foreign investment led to greater improvements no matter how they are measured. Second, as we have argued elsewhere, what mattered most was the _transparency_ of privatization and avoidance of insider privileges. Third, much of the literature largely ignores the role of private sector development. How much of the increase in the private sector share of the economy was due to the creation of new enterprises as opposed to the privatization of previously state-owned enterprises? A meaningful assessment of the role played by private sector development, both new and denationalized, cannot be done without answers to this question.



The EU played an important role in promoting reforms in accession candidates, but there remains some dispute on the degree to which the prospect of EU membership worked as an external pressure toward reforms on governments in ex-communist countries. That internal commitment to reform was important is exemplified by the Baltic countries, which were not accepted into the EU accession process until 1995 — some three or four years later than the Central European countries. Yet, even without the EU membership incentive, the Baltic countries embraced far-reaching reforms. In contrast, external pressure was very effective in the case of Slovakia in 1998. Under Prime Minister Vladimir Mečiar few reforms took place and Slovakia was warned that it could be dropped from the first group of EU entrants. Partly as a result of the EU snub, Mečiar was voted out of office in the fall of 1998 and replaced by a reformist prime minister, Mikuláš Dzurinda.



Finally, let us propose a way of tying together the various aspects of transition that we have discussed in this paper and explain how they provide support for the central hypothesis — that early and speedy reforms delivered much better results, while delayed and hesitant reforms created conditions for poor performance and barriers to completion of reforms.44



Reforms may be delayed or be gradual for different reasons, but in most cases delays or gradualism happened because the preceding communist ruling class remained in power and sought to become the new capitalist class. To achieve that aim, the former communists needed time. With private ownership allowed, but market liberalization delayed or partial, arbitrage and rent-seeking opportunities were created that were most favorable to insiders. As the new capitalists developed and gradually became rich enough to acquire oligarch power, they continued to prefer a partially reformed economy, nontransparency, a privileged insider position, a monopoly-like status, and protection against new entrants based on onerous regulations for small- and medium-sized businesses. This process was also abetted by the retention of government subsidies, poor rule of law, and other institutional deficiencies. Also, EU membership requirements run exactly counter to the interests of the new oligarchy. The EU insists on competitive markets, transparency, the rule of law, and so on.



Many economists recognized the trap of this rent-seeking model, and some have argued that more privatization would eventually lead the new capitalists to demand protection of property rights and rule of law. That was an important part of the rationale for rapid privatization in Russia in the mid-nineties.45 In retrospect, it is not clear that this process evolved quite as predicted. The oligarchs discovered that their informal power provided all the protection that they needed, and that liberalization threatened their position.46 Hence they continued to influence government policy to remain within the vicious circle.



Twenty-five years of evidence resolves most, but not all, of the major questions concerning transition from communist dictatorship to capitalism and democracy. The main debate between rapid and gradual reformers seems to be settled in favor of the former. The empirical correlation between the speed of reforms and relevant measures of economic and social results shows that rapid reformers far outperformed gradual reformers. The argument of the big-bang proponents that delaying reforms would permit rent-seeking and state capture by the economic elite has been largely confirmed in the rise of the oligarchs. Rich capitalists have, of course, arisen in all transition economies, but their concentration and degree of political influence appears to be far higher in slowly reforming countries, in particular the large economies of the former USSR.



Moreover, trends held strongly over the past 25 years. Early reform leaders still lead, and most of the laggards still lag. Breaking out of the gradualist mold is not easy, although that was precisely what some people tried to accomplish through the various ""color revolutions."" Alas, only one true success story can be found. That success story is Georgia, and even the Georgian example is not a complete success.47



As to the timing of institutional development, the arguments that it should precede liberalization are not supported by the historical facts. Neither the rapid reformers, nor the international financial institutions, ignored institutional development. The fastest progress on institutions was made by the very same countries that undertook rapid liberalization.



The above does not, of course, rule out the logic of a counterfactual argument that some scholars still make today — that is, had the rapid reformers moved even earlier and faster on institutional development, things would have turned out even better. Unfortunately, no basis exists for testing this hypothesis. There has not been a single case of a country that reformed its institutions in advance of market liberalization.48



While the transition is largely over in the most advanced ex-communist countries, legal and regulatory reforms remain unfinished. The lessons from the most advanced countries are not complicated. Countries need to ensure financial stability, and to continue to deregulate and simplify their regulations in order to eliminate corruption and rent-seeking.



The countries of the former USSR are much farther behind. State capture and rent-seeking by oligarchs is high, and vested interests have a lot to lose from liberalization.49 In a few instances, where popular democratic movements created a new window of opportunity for reform (Serbia, 2000; Georgia, 2003; Ukraine, 2004; Kyrgyz Republic, 2005; and Ukraine again, 2014), governments became more amenable to reform, although the new efforts may not have always succeeded.50



This monograph is dedicated to the millions of Ukrainians who, in the cold winter of 2004, and then again in the winter of 2013, came out on the streets of Kyiv to demand their freedom and a release from the grip of abusive and self-serving politicians. In particular, may this monograph help to preserve the memory of those who gave their lives in the noble fight for freedom. We want to thank Raluca Stan, a PhD student at West Virginia University, for her early and speedy assistance with the initial data analysis.

35\. True, unemployment rates were much lower in the former Soviet Union, which had an unemployment rate of between 5 percent and 8 percent. Poland, in contrast, had an unemployment rate in the high teens. However, early recovery in Poland allowed unemployment benefits to be paid. In the former Soviet Union employment did not ensure wage payments (as the state sometimes did not have enough revenue to pay the workers). This is shown in Eswar Prasad and Michael Keane, ""Consumption and Income Inequality in Poland during the Economic Transition,"" IMF Working Paper no. 14 (1999). Also, it is important to bear in mind that official figures, which claimed that unemployment was low (or in the case of Turkmenistan, ""zero""), were often false.

One reason for ignoring the Belarusian example is that it is only one exception that counters evidence from 28 other countries. Another reason is to note that as ""the last dictatorship in Europe,"" Belarus is hardly a desirable model of post-communist transformation. Moreover, many skeptics doubt the veracity of Belarusian statistics or suggest that much of the Belarusian success is thanks to huge subsidies from Russia. However, attempts to estimate a more realistic GDP or to measure the value of Russian subsidies are not enough to label Belarus as an economic failure. This paper has not attempted to resolve the Belarusian puzzle and leaves it for future research.



49\. A brief history of the color revolutions is a cautionary tale. Once the oligarchic and bureaucratic vested interests are in place, a mere change of government does not ensure success. The failures of Ukraine's Orange Revolution and Kyrgyz's Tulip Revolution attest to the difficulty of sustaining reforms. In contrast, Georgia's Rose Revolution has met with success, albeit limited, and showed that reform is possible with enough forcefulness and resoluteness by both the street activists and a new, committed government.



50\. Moldova's political establishment, while formally communist, has reacted to the population's desire to move closer toward the European Union. As such, the regime undertook reforms that went against some of the new vested interests.

Skeptics routinely get smeared by Al Gore, Michael Mann, and others of being like and/or in the employ of “Big Oil’, ‘Big Coal’, or “Big Tobacco’. Yet many of the same people who hurl such accusations seem blind to their own ‘big’ predicament. Dr. Roger Pielke Jr. had this to say about that in a series of tweets today.

“The market is not working as it should” has been Theresa May’s economic justification for energy price caps. In most public policy debates it suffices to yell “market failure” or the “market is broken” to rationalise any intervention you desire. How many times in the past few years have we heard about a broken housing/​childcare/​energy market without any analysis of the underlying causes?



Economists, at least, have a very clear definition of market failure: a deviation from a perfectly competitive world with perfect information, no transactions costs, and no effects on third parties from the production or consumption of the good or service.



Theoretical government policies can then supposedly be applied to remedy situations where these assumptions do not hold. But judge any industry, from food through to manufacturing to healthcare, by the unattainable standards set out above, and they will be deemed failures.



The real question is not whether markets are perfect, but whether government interventions to solve perceived failures do more harm than good. In other words, markets may not be “perfect”, but that does not mean they are perfectable by governments.



This is pertinent, because both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have used the “broken market” terminology regularly to justify their policies. The impression they give us is that laissez faire, free market capitalism is failing and ripping off consumers and tenants, requiring an interventionist government.





“Doing something” for the sake of acting to “restore faith” in markets is as naïve as it is ahistorical.



In fact, the truth is closer to the exact opposite for the housing, childcare and energy sectors they talk most about. The desire now to “do something” stems from previous policy mistakes to try to correct market failures — or, as economists would call it, “government failure”.



To stop the supposed market failure of urban sprawl and unplanned communities, for example, Britain introduced greenbelts, land use planning regulations and essentially nationalized development rights in the mid‐​20th century.



The economists Christian Hilber and Wouter Vermeulen estimated that as much as 35pc of the average house price can now be attributed to these planning constraints. High rents and prices, as well as insufficient building, are primarily caused by very tight land‐​use planning laws.



Indeed, the Conservative party has implicitly admitted this by pledging less generous compensation for land owners subject to compulsory purchase orders. Granting only the value of the land today rather than the potential value with planning permission means the Government gets to retain the uplift when permission is granted. They want to do this precisely because this premium is high, showing how distortive the Government’s monopoly power on development is.



The proposed fixes from the Conservatives and Labour, in the form of council house building or rent controls, are simply ill‐​thought‐​through responses.



The past two decades have also seen the Government more involved in childcare on market failure grounds. Childcare would be underused absent state support, we were told, because parents would not fully recognize the social benefits of more women working or early education. Regulation was required because uninformed parents would not choose the right amount of “high quality” care.



Successive governments have therefore formalized the sector and regulated it more heavily, contributing to higher prices and ballooning subsidies. The UK now has some of the most stringent staff: child ratios in Europe, and mandates that staff and childminders are in effect early years’ educators. The number of childminders has fallen by more than half as a result. Now, surprise, politicians are worried about the affordability of care.



In energy, prices actually plunged in the UK between 1990 and 2004 when the sector was privatized and liberalized. Now, environmental obligations to solve the market failure of climate change continue to raise bills, and come on top of increased wholesale prices.



Stephen Littlechild has highlighted on these pages how it was the energy regulator Ofgem’s 2008 attempts to eliminate “unfair” price discrimination too which actually led to an upward compression with lower tariffs raised. Its restrictions on doorstep selling and marketing likewise contributed to lower customer switching rates.



Now the Conservatives see both high bills and low switching as problems and want to intervene further with a price cap. Yet nobody from the party can explain how this will make providers more efficient and able to deliver the lower prices economically.



The lesson is clear: government intervention has been highly damaging. To make the sectors more competitive and responsive, any government would need to unpick the knot of existing policies rather than engage in further crude interventions.



Adopting price controls and subsidies simply to signal you care would be a mistake. “Doing something” for the sake of acting to “restore faith” in markets is as naïve as it is ahistorical. Most interventions by the Government have perverse consequences, without solving the perceived problem. This leads to more frustration and a growing demand for ever‐​tougher action.

There’s a dark rumour being whispered in some quarters that the whole point of the farcical Trump impeachment process isn’t actually to get Trump at all. After all, it’s patently obvious that even Democrats know that they’re never going to succeed. Instead, the whisper goes, the real object of the proceedings is to nobble Democrat front-runner Joe Biden by exposing his own dodgy dealings in Ukraine. With Uncle Joe gone, the path is clear for Hillary 2.0, Elizabeth Warren.



It’s a ridiculous conspiracy theory, of course. Just like the exaggerated rumours that the Democrats conspired to get rid of Bernie Sanders by hook or by crook in 2016. Oh, wait…



Meanwhile, [Fauxahontas](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/democrat-elites-regard-mainstream-americans-with-contempt/) is sharpening her tomahawk and eying Biden’s scalp. And questions are being raised about the world’s dodgiest Indian.



At last, serious questions are being asked in the US about the radical agenda of rising Democrat presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.



The overdue scrutiny has been prompted by a series of new polls showing the populist left-winger fast gaining on the moderate Joe Biden as the frontrunner for her party’s nomination.



This has coincided with the release of an extraordinary document from Warren which seeks to explain the magic pudding-style funding plan for her $US20.5 trillion ‘Medicare for all’ proposal to create a universal healthcare program across the US.



Yes, the American healthcare system is a horrorshow. But the way it currently is, is almost entirely thanks to the Democrat trifecta of the Clintons and Obama. As Christopher Hitchens detailed in _No-one left to lie to_ , Hillary Clinton’s “reforms” in the 90s delivered an unprecedented windfall to the vulturous American private health mega-corporations. Obamacare made things even worse.



Now, Crockagewa wants to socialise the whole lot.



What Warren proposes goes even beyond the universal health care schemes in Australia and Britain by scrapping the option of private health insurance entirely, forcing the cancellation of private insurance for around 160 million Americans.



She has costed the scheme – a costing which the Wall Street Journal describes as a ‘fiscal and health-care fantasy’ – at $US20.5 trillion over ten years despite three other major US studies costing it at far more, between $US31 trillion and $US34 trillion.



Warren’s grandiose plan is so ludicrous that even Bernie Sanders thinks it’s nuts. Think about that: a socialist program that’s too crazy even for Crazy Bernie.



Warren is campaigning on a broad far-left agenda far more radical than anything ever proposed by the two-term Democrat presidents Obama and Bill Clinton.



She is, in effect, proposing to remake the US economy, including lifting the corporate tax rate from 21 per cent to 35 per cent, a 2 per cent wealth tax on the richest Americans and steep cuts to defence spending.



She would use these proceeds to pay for universal health and child care, a cancellation of student debt and aggressive action on climate change.



Even other Democrats can see what a pox-ridden blanket Warren will be to their chances in 2020.



Democrat house leader Nancy Pelosi is understandably worried that the Democrats are marching towards electoral suicide if they nominate either Warren or Sanders to run against Trump **.**



“What works in San Francisco does not necessarily work in Michigan,” Pelosi said this week in a thinly-veiled jab at Warren and Sanders.



Interesting choice of references: both are areas long-run by the Democrat left. San Francisco is a wasteland of skyrocketing house prices and piles of human excrement in the streets. Michigan can’t even supply its people with clean water.



Warren’s mantra on the campaign trail is that ‘our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and powerful.’



Warren’s personal worth is in the tens of millions. Largely earned by demanding astronomical tuition fees from the very students whose cause she claims to champion.



But at least one person will be popping the champagne if Warren wins the nomination: Donald Trump.

While Congressional elections are an entire year away, a different election season is almost upon us that could also impact public policy. These elections are driven by large public pension funds and asset managers advocating for increasingly political agendas during the annual meetings of publicly‐​held companies. For the majority of U.S. households who hold a portion of their retirement assets in the stock market in some form, it could mean that some of their money will be used to support a political agenda that hurts their investment returns.



A majority of U.S. publicly listed companies hold their annual shareholder meetings — which the Securities and Exchange Commission requires them to conduct — between March and July. Shareholders holding as little as $2,000 worth of stock have the right to put proposals on the company ballot, along with a 500 word supportive statement. In years past, these proposals tended to be about improving corporate governance, with a simple agenda: improving returns for shareholders.



Regrettably, politics has entered the shareholder proposal space, and these days the typical proposal has less to do with improving the long‐​term value of the company and, instead, increasingly focuses on political agendas that are often irrelevant to the company’s mission — but not its bottom line.



Many of these proposals constitute little more than harmless exercises, and stand little chance of passing. However, to blithely assume that any proposal that might actually harm a company’s bottom line would invariably be voted down by the shareholders would be mistaken.



The sponsors of such proposals are often able to skillfully craft their proxies so as to make it exceedingly difficult for investors to reject them. Company boards usually must at least make an effort to comply with these non‐​binding proposals, regardless of the negative impact to underlying shareholder value.



While some proposals still aim to push companies towards the best practices for corporate governance, social and environmental proposals rule the roost these days. According to Proxy Monitor and the National Association of Corporate Directors, the largest 250 companies faced more environmental, political and social proposals in 2017 than all corporate governance proposals combined, and a report in the Harvard Law Forum found that over 40% of shareholder proposals in 2017 dealt with environmental and social issues.



The content of these proposals is not what should alarm shareholders but rather that these decisions are being sponsored, placed, paid for and voted on by large financial entities whose real responsibility ought to be to manage money.



The politicization of the proxy proposal process has been led by institutions that represent millions of public workers and retirees — including the New York City Pension Funds and State Common Retirement Fund and the California Public Employee Retirement System (CalPERS) and State Teachers’ Retirement System — in an effort to promote a political agenda that has failed to achieve results through the political process. Between 2006 and 2015, these funds alone put forward 235 shareholder proposals, and they submitted 127 more in 2016. NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer has already jump‐​started the 2018 season with letters to 151 public companies that will no doubt result in a new wave of proposals shortly.



t’s worth noting that these four public pensions are a combined $338 billion underfunded, based on their own (conservative) calculations, which puts their state’s taxpayers at risk of needing to make up future shortfalls. Pursuing a political agenda that could potentially depress their funds’ returns seems counterproductive, to say the least.



The top asset managers – BlackRock, State Street Global, and Vanguard – also work closely with (and for) public pension funds, and together they control over $9 trillion. After years of voting against value‐​destroying proposals, they are increasingly likely to acquiesce as they derive increasing fees from pension funds, which provides them a non‐​fiduciary motivation to vote for the pet causes of their clients. Reports that CalPERS may outsource management of its $26 billion private equity business to BlackRock reinforces the new reality driving so much of the activism today: the pension funds are calling the shots.



Many shareholder proposals today ask companies to take actions that can harm them competitively, particularly when they compete against foreign or private companies unaffected by such strictures. Requiring a fossil fuel company to write yet another crystal‐​ball report about how it might fare in decades into the future owing to climate change — to cite one common proxy proposal — will not increase its value or come close to achieving any broader public policy goal.



As we enter the season of shareholder meetings it is worth pondering, for every proxy vote taken, whether money managers are more interested in growing their political influence than in growing the value of their investments.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has been loudly trumpeting its latest paper on Atlantic ocean overturning circulation today, claiming there’s been an “exceptional twentieth-century slowdown“. The authors, who include Stefan Rahmstorf and Michael E. Mann, even suggest that the “possible cause of the weakening is climate change“.
Some sites, like Climate Central here, have been unable to contain their glee over the news of the potential climate-change induced oceanic shifts being served up by the PIK. For example the site called the findings “dramatic” and writes (my emphasis):
If the climate relationships identified by the researchers, led by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, hold true, growing melt rates in Greenland ‘might lead to further weakening of the AMOC within a decade or two, and possibly even more permanent shutdown’ of key components of it, the scientists warn in their paper.”

The “new” weakening Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.

Spiegel and the FAZ pour cold water on paper
Fortunately other media sources have been somewhat more critical and report that there’s skepticism on the paper – coming from warmist circles, no less.
Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) here for example writes that Rahmstorf is puzzled that a part of the north Atlantic has cooled over the last 100 years: “The cooling was stronger than what most computer models calculated it would be,” the FAZ reports. Models wrong again!
The FAZ then writes that, “An independent expert assesses the estimation skeptically”, adding:
Climate scientist Martin Visbeck of the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research in Kiel sees Rahmstorf’s assertion of the results critically: ‘The study’s focus on the sub-polar part of the Atlantic and the spectral analysis are interesting,’ he says. But there are other AMOC assessments that point to a completely other development. The paper does not offer any strong indication of the development of the AMOC during the past fifty years.”
When a warmist dismisses another warmists’s science, then you know it’s likely pretty slipshod.
Der Spiegel reports that the study is lacking

German flagship online news weekly Der Spiegel echoed the FAZ, quoting Michael Hofstätter of the Austrian national weather service: the Zentralanstalt für Meteorologie und Geodynamik (ZAMG) in Vienna. Spiegel writes that Hofstätter also “rates the Rahmstorf study with skepticism“.
Spiegel reminds its readers: “Most studies are assuming that the current is in fact stronger.” Spiegel continues:
The temperature fluctuations could also be a ‘temporary natural variation,’ Hofstätter told the online service of the ORF. The measurements covered a time period that was too short to allow concrete forecasts.”
Other websites censored reports of skepticism and uncertainty
For example the end-of-climate conspiracy theorists at German alarmist site Klimaretter of course could not be bothered to mention the study is disputed even by fellow warmist scientists.
Dr. Mann blocks critic at Twitter
Michael Mann also did not want to hear any non-alarmist opinion as well. At Facebook he blocked fair comments left by Jaime Jessop, who kept a screen-shot:

Mann removed my comments (of course) & his reply on FB re. THC slowing on – but not before I took a snapshot: pic.twitter.com/iIEVib8lcO

From NASA JPL, video animation follows.



Wet weather is again hitting drought-stricken California as the second and larger of two back-to-back storms makes its way ashore. The storms are part of an atmospheric river, a narrow channel of concentrated moisture in the atmosphere connecting tropical air with colder, drier regions around Earth’s middle latitudes. 
The storm that arrived on Feb. 26, 2014, and the one about to hit, are contained within the “Pineapple Express,” an atmospheric river that extends from the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii to the Pacific coast of North America, where it often brings heavy precipitation. This next storm is expect to be the largest rain producer in Southern California in three years.
This animation, created with data acquired by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument on NASA’s Aqua satellite, shows the total amount of water vapor contained in the atmosphere for most of the month of February if it were all to fall as rain. Typically, the atmosphere over Southern California and most of the continental U.S. in winter holds only about 0.4 inch (10 millimeters) or less of water vapor. However, much wetter air lies tantalizingly close in regions to the south and west. The largest amounts of atmospheric moisture, up to 2.4 inches (60 millimeters), are associated with a persistent band of thunderstorms circling the tropics. These thunderstorms are the source of several atmospheric rivers apparent in this animation. One atmospheric river arises near Hawaii around Feb. 10 and comes ashore in Central California a few days later, bringing the largest Sierra Nevada snowfall of the season to date. Other atmospheric rivers can be see originating in the Gulf of Mexico and extending into the Atlantic on the right side of the movie; the northward movement of tropical water vapor is important in winter storms in the eastern U.S. and Europe. The animation concludes with the current Pineapple Express. Moisture from around Hawaii has surged northeast, and the persistent, dry air immediately west of Baja California has been replace by air with up to 1.6 inches (40 millimeters) of water vapor. The next storm will bring that moisture ashore, where it will be forced upward by coastal mountains to fall as heavy rain. Up to 8 inches (20.3 centimeters) of rain is predicted in some parts of the Los Angeles area by March 2, bringing possible flooding and landslides to recent wildfire burn areas.
The recent cold conditions in the eastern U.S. are also apparent in this movie as very dry regions. Because cold air can hold relatively little water (less than 0.4 inch or 10 millimeters), cold region are always dry. So, the eastern U.S. has some of the driest air in this animation. However, high pressure systems also dry the atmosphere by forcing down air from above.
That descending air expands and warms, but retains the low moisture amounts it had when it was higher and cold. So, cold Minnesota and warm Mexico have similar water vapor amounts in this movie.

"WASHINGTON  —   The two most influential social liberals in President Trump’s inner circle  —   daughter Ivanka and    Jared Kushner  —   helped kill a proposed executive order that would have scrapped   L. G. B. T. protections, according to people familiar with the issue. A third, Gary D. Cohn, the chairman of the president’s National Economic Council, a Democrat who was brought to the West Wing by Mr. Kushner and reflects the socially liberal and economically conservative views of many Wall Street power brokers, privately told aides to the president that he was disturbed it was even being considered. The executive order has exposed what is likely to be a persistent schism in Mr. Trump’s paradoxical presidency: He is a cosmopolitan New Yorker who has long operated in an environment where sexual orientation is often an afterthought, but is nonetheless beholden to the social conservatives who backed him overwhelmingly in 2016, despite reports of his crudeness and sexual misdeeds. Mr. Kushner, a lifelong Democrat, and Ms. Trump, an independent, travel in liberal social circles and have long supported L. G. B. T. rights. Neither had seen the order before details were leaked. They expressed their dissatisfaction to Mr. Trump’s other advisers, and then weighed in directly with the president, who opposes   marriage but has spoken out against discrimination. On Monday night, reports had swirled that Mr. Trump would sign some version of the rollback as a concession to social conservatives ahead of the president’s announcement of a United States Supreme Court nominee. As a result, White House officials pushed out a statement asserting that Mr. Trump “is determined to protect the rights of all Americans, including the L. G. B. T. Q. community,” adding that the president “continues to be respectful and supportive of L. G. B. T. Q. rights, just as he was throughout the election. ” The draft order, circulated by religious conservatives allied with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, was one of about 250 edicts that have been sent to federal agencies for vetting. Mr. Trump never seriously considered signing the order, and did not need much convincing, people close to him said. Still, conservatives inside the Trump camp pressured the president to consider a version of a “religious freedom” measure, similar to one supported by Mr. Pence in 2015 while he was the governor of Indiana, according to two senior administration officials. Mr. Pence, however, did not personally push for the White House order, according to one of his allies. Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump’s opposition to the draft was first reported by Politico. It came on the heels of an announcement by the Nordstrom department store chain that it will scale back on featuring Ms. Trump’s clothing line from its stores, a public blow to a brand she has spent years cultivating. A day after the White House quashed the religious freedom order, at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Mr. Trump offered religious conservatives an olive branch by proposing to eliminate a law that bars churches with Internal Revenue Service charity designations from making political endorsements. Some conservative leaders warned Mr. Trump that his decision to retain former President Barack Obama’s order on L. G. B. T. rights could have   political implications. “Our base would want to know who is responsible for what we believe is an issue of religious liberty  —   that would be of concern to us,” said Bob Vander Plaats, the chief executive of The Family Leader, a socially conservative organization. “We have been consistent,” Mr. Vander Plaats added. “We’ve cheered President Trump a lot. But on this one, our base is wondering why Obama’s executive order would be allowed to stand?” Tony Perkins, the president of the conservative Family Research Council, backed the draft order and said he believed Mr. Trump’s opposition was only temporary. He pointed out that evangelicals were supportive of Mr. Trump during the campaign, and that there would need to be reconciliation between his support for religious liberty and his decision to uphold the L. G. B. T. order. “He gets it,” Mr. Perkins said of the president. “They will have to fix it and they will. I’m confident they will. Am I concerned? No. Not at this point. ” The topic of the order was a sensitive one in a West Wing that prides itself on decisiveness and bombast. “There are a lot of ideas that are being floated out,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Thursday. “Part of it is, the president does all the time, he asks for input, he asks for ideas. And on a variety of subjects there are staffing procedures that go on where people have a thought or an idea and it goes through the process. ”"

Investigators have concluded that the driver of the CTA train that crashed at O'Hare earlier this week slept through the stop. Moreover, she apparently had a record of falling asleep at work before. However, investigators also concluded that two back-up systems that should have stopped the train before it crashed even without a waking driver failed as well.   




  


![Media Name: TransitSubsidies&Trips60-12.jpg](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/download-remote-images/ti.org/8693878921/TransitSubsidies%26Trips60-12.jpg?itok=a6kOqYKO)





_We've spent roughly $1 trillion on transit since 1970 for not much return. Capital spending before 1990 is not available, but probably followed a trajectory similar to operating subsidies (=op costs minus fares). Click image to download a spreadsheet with these and other data mentioned in this post._



Meanwhile, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) defends its claim that recent ridership statistics represent a genuine ""shift in American travel behavior."" While it admits that per capita ridership has declined since 2008, it blames that on the recession. It prefers to go back to 1995, ""because after that year, ridership increased due to the passage of the landmark ISTEA legislation and other surface transportation bills which increased funding for public transportation."" Effectively, APTA argues that people will ride transit if you subsidize them enough, and so therefore subsidies should be increased still further.   
  
(By the way, APTA responded to my statement that virtually all of the growth in ridership in 2013 took place in New York City, saying, ""That statement is not true. . . . Many other systems across the country saw ridership gains last year."" But I never said that every single transit system outside of New York declined, only that the sum total, minus New York, declined, which is easily verified from APTA's own data.)   
  
APTA is correct that transit ridership bottomed out in 1995, at least according to its numbers. (Federal Transit Administration numbers are a little different and show ridership bottoming out in 1993.) But it is a stretch to say that subsidies are responsible for the growth in ridership since 1995 (or '93). Both operating and capital subsidies to transit have grown steadily since the mid 1960s, but ridership hasn't always followed.   
  
In particular, ridership declined through 1972 to about 6.6 million trips, then increased through 1980 to about 8.5 million trips, hovered around there for about a decade, then declined from 8.9 million trips in 1989 to 7.8 million trips in 1995, then increased to 10.5 million trips in 2008, and has hovered around there since then. If increased subsidies were responsible for the increase after 1995, why didn't increased subsidies lead to increased ridership between 1965 and 1972 or between 1989 and 1995?   




Obviously, many things influence ridership other than subsidies. Employment, for example, has grown from 117 million jobs in 1995 to 136 million in 2013. Gas prices have grown from $1.64 (in today's dollars) in 1995 to $3.58 in 2013. Admittedly, neither of these explanations are, by themselves, satisfactory: transit trips per worker have grown by 19 percent since 1995, and gas prices didn't start increasing until 2000.   
  
APTA's answer to why subsidies boosted ridership in the last two decades but didn't necessarily do it before then is found in its claim that ""Cities that have invested in high frequency public transportation and transit-oriented development policies are experiencing significant ridership growth."" But this simply isn't true: as I've previously noted, 2013 transit ridership declined in Charlotte, Dallas, Portland and several other cities that have invested in such transit.   
  
For the sake of argument, let's say subsidies were responsible for much of the growth in transit ridership. Is it worth it? From 1995 to 2012, transit ridership grew by 35 percent. During that same period (after adjusting for inflation), operating subsidies grew by 56 percent and capital subsidies by 67 percent. In today's dollars, the average subsidy per trip in 1995 was $3.33, but the subsidy for the added trips in 2012 averaged $5.62.   
  
Even if you think it is worth $5.62 to get one person out of their car for one trip, the changes we've seen can hardly be considered a major shift in American travel habits. The Census Bureau reports that 4.7 percent of people took transit to work in 2000. That's grown to 5.0 percent in 2012, which might sound good except it was 5.3 percent in 1990. (The Census Bureau has made annual surveys since 2005, but didn't do so in the 1990s.)   
  
APTA also says, ""The cities that have invested in public transportation are reaping the benefits of ridership and economic growth."" Yet I've shown elsewhere that cities that spend the most on public transit grow slower than ones that spend less.   
  
APTA looks at all these numbers and argues that, ""We need to expand public transportation access so more people have travel choices."" I look at the numbers and see that we have spent an awful lot of money to get some very minor changes. In order to get these minor changes, cities are not only spending billions of dollars on obsolete transportation systems, they are trying to impose huge lifestyle changes on Americans, such as by reducing the share of households in single-family homes from 65 percent to 41 percent, as Portland seeks to do.   
  
Recently, a Michigan reporter asked me whether SMART--Detroit's suburban transit agency--was an efficient transit operator, as it says it needs a tax increase to keep going. I pointed out that its bus fares covered only 18 percent of bus operating costs in 2012, well below the industry average of 28 percent.   
  
But even 28 percent is a pretty pathetic benchmark. What do we get for all these subsidies? We get transit systems that run nearly empty buses and trains much of the day so that, on average, they are no more energy efficient or climate friendly than driving. We get construction of expensive transit systems that cities like Chicago can't afford to maintain. We get highly paid workers who fall asleep on the job expecting that their passengers will be protected by back-up systems that fail because we didn't bother to maintain them.   
  
Fundamentally, we get a system that's broken because no one is beholden to the customers whose fares cover, on average, a mere 25 percent of the costs. Instead, they cater to the politicians who allocate the other 75 percent to agencies based on political muscle and back room payoffs. (Does anyone think that their mayor wouldn't take bribes, or at least campaign contributions, from railcar manufacturers and contractors in exchange for their support for rail boondoggles?) Contrary to APTA's claims, the transit industry is in deep trouble and must be reformed by reducing, not increasing, subsidies so that transit agencies will be responsive to users, not politicians.

"The UK government’s overseas development bank has bowed to calls to end fossil fuel financing abroad by promising to invest only in companies that align with the Paris climate agreement. The CDC Group revealed its new climate strategy, which will end support for the most polluting fossil fuel projects, including the production of oil and coal, and channel almost a third of its spending towards climate finance.  The publicly owned investor, which supports job-creating sectors in Africa and south Asia, will end financing for coal mining, and oil and gas production, as well as new or existing power plants and refineries that use coal or heavy oil. The UK government is under growing pressure to end its support for overseas fossil fuel projects after campaigners revealed that more than £3bn in public money was used to support polluting projects abroad since the Paris climate agreement was signed. Environmental campaigners have accused ministers of “rank hypocrisy” for claiming a global lead in decarbonising the British economy while continuing to fund fossil fuel projects overseas.  The Guardian has revealed that senior civil servants are in talks over a government-wide policy to curb foreign fossil fuel support before the UK hosts the UN climate talks next year. The decision to curb support follows an exodus of major institutional investors from the coal industry in recent years, including Goldman Sachs and Blackrock. Investors are wary of supporting industries that contribute to the climate crisis, and may risk the financial stability of their funds. Norway’s $1.19tn (£950bn) sovereign wealth fund, the largest in the world, has decided to reduce its exposure to oil and gas investments too, to guard against the risk of a quicker than expected global shift away from fossil fuels towards cleaner alternatives.  The CDC’s new climate strategy will place “a climate lens” over every sector in which it invests to make sure companies are reducing emissions, according to the development bank. Nick O’Donohoe, the CDC’s chief executive, said: “Climate change remains the single largest challenge faced by the planet and is the defining issue for our generation and for those that will follow. That is why we have launched this ground-breaking climate change strategy that will shape every single investment decision we make moving forward.” The bank will allow only rare investments in gas power plants to support the UN’s sustainable development goals, and only in countries that can prove the project is aligned with a wider climate transition plan. This exception is likely to anger climate campaign groups, which would prefer a complete end to all fossil fuel support in favour of renewable energy investments. Others argue that the social and economic benefits of modest fossil fuel investments in areas with very limited energy access would outweigh the incremental increase in emissions they would produce. A recent report on energy in Africa by the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned that some new investment in gas-fired power generation would be needed alongside a surge in renewable energy - but the impact on global climate emissions would be negligible. Amal-Lee Amin, the CDC’s director of climate change, said: “Countries in Africa and south Asia are tackling the climate emergency alongside other urgent needs, most notably the need for economic growth, increased energy access and improved living standards to meet the needs of their citizens and to meet the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs).” “We will also invest in new opportunities and shape the markets that are needed to ensure the low carbon transition is socially just and that development pathways are resilient to existing and future climate risks and impacts.” "
"TOKYO  —   Defense Secretary Jim Mattis assured Japan’s prime minister on Friday that the United States would stand by its mutual defense treaty with the country, despite statements by President Trump during last year’s campaign that suggested he might pull back from American security commitments in Asia. “I want there to be no misunderstanding during the transition in Washington that we stand firmly, 100 percent, shoulder to shoulder with you and the Japanese people,” Mr. Mattis said at the start of a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Mr. Trump, when he was running for president, had complained that the defense treaty was   even suggesting that the United States should threaten to withdraw from it unless Japan did more to compensate Washington for helping to defend its territory. “You always have to be prepared to walk,” Mr. Trump said in August. “I don’t think it’s going to be necessary. It could be, though. ” With North Korea threatening to test an intercontinental ballistic missile and China claiming sovereignty over nearly all of the South China Sea, the Trump administration is now emphasizing its “ironclad” commitment to the security of Japan and South Korea. Still, Mr. Trump’s conflicting signals and his transactional approach to diplomacy have made allies nervous. So even as the president shakes up Washington, Mr. Mattis has scored points in Asia by emphasizing that the United States’ relationship with its allies has not fundamentally changed. In Japan, that included assurances about Article 5 of the treaty, which commits the United States to helping defend territory that Japan administers should it be attacked. “Due to some of the provocations out of North Korea and other challenges that we jointly face, I want to make certain that Article 5 of our mutual defense treaty is understood to be as real to us today as it was a year ago, five years ago, and as it will be a year and 10 years from now,” Mr. Mattis told Mr. Abe. Japan hosts about 50, 000 American troops on bases throughout the country, and it relies on the American nuclear umbrella. Given that the alliance has lasted since the end of World War II, analysts said it was somewhat surprising that it would be necessary to reassure Japan that it remained solid. “It’s sad that we’ve even come to this point,” said Jeffrey Hornung, a fellow in the security and foreign affairs program at Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA, a research institute based in Washington. “But in the context that we’re in, that reassurance is very important. ” A particular concern for Mr. Abe, who is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump in Washington next week, is confirmation that the United States would defend Japan in any confrontation with China over a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea, known in Japan as the Senkaku and in China as the Diaoyu. Former President Barack Obama declared during a visit to Tokyo three years ago that the security treaty obligated the United States to do so, the first president to state that commitment publicly. Mr. Mattis did not explicitly mention the islands publicly Friday, but American officials said later that he had reiterated the United States “longstanding” position on the islands in his private meeting with Mr. Abe. Mr. Mattis made a point of saying on Friday that he had served on the Japanese island of Okinawa as a young Marine. Mr. Abe, for his part, said it was important that Japan was one of the first places Mr. Mattis had visited as defense secretary. Earlier Friday, Mr. Mattis wound up a   visit to Seoul, South Korea, where he sought to reassure officials that the American commitment to defend their country, particularly in the face of North Korea’s accelerating nuclear threat, was also unchanged. “Any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated,” Mr. Mattis said in a joint appearance with the South Korean defense minister, Han  . “And any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming,” he added, using a formulation that has been employed by previous Pentagon chiefs. During Mr. Mattis’s talks with South Korean officials, the two sides affirmed that they would move ahead with plans developed under the Obama administration to deploy a new antimissile system to counter North Korea’s   missiles. China has objected to the deployment of the system, known as Thaad, which stands for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense. “Due to North Korea’s threatening rhetoric and destabilizing behavior, we are taking defensive steps like deploying the highly effective Thaad antimissile unit,” Mr. Mattis said on Friday. Mr. Mattis did not specify when the Thaad system would be deployed. American and South Korean officials have said that it would be before the end of the year, though American officials would like to see the timetable accelerated."
"The amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere is approaching a level not seen in 15m years and perhaps never previously experienced by a hominoid, according to the authors of a study. At pre-lockdown rates of increase, within five years atmospheric CO2 will pass 427 parts per million, which was the probable peak of the mid-Pliocene warming period 3.3m years ago, when temperatures were 3C to 4C hotter and sea levels were 20 metres higher than today.  But it seems we must now go much further back to see what’s ahead. Some time around 2025, the Earth is likely to have CO2 conditions not experienced since the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum 15m years ago, around the time our ancestors are thought to have diverged from orangutans and become recognisably hominoid. For the paper published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports, a team of researchers from the University of Southampton constructed a new high-resolution record of atmospheric CO2 during the Pliocene using data derived from the boron levels in tiny fossils about the size of a pin head collected from deep ocean sediments of the Caribbean Sea. This confirmed trends previously observed in ice cores, but also allowed a more precise estimate of the CO2 range in that geological epoch, when levels of solar radiation were the same as today. “A striking result we’ve found is that the warmest part of the Pliocene had between 380 and 420 parts per million CO2 in the atmosphere,” one of the co-authors Thomas Chalk, said. “This is similar to today’s value of around 415 parts per million, showing that we are already at levels that in the past were associated with temperature and sea-level significantly higher than today.” “Currently, our CO2 levels are rising at about 2.5 ppm per year, meaning that by 2025 we will have exceeded anything seen in the last 3.3 million years.” The authors said the study of the past provided a guide to what is likely to happen in the future as the Earth responds to the buildup of greenhouse gas from the past two centuries of industrial emissions. “Ice sheets today haven’t had a chance to catch up with CO2 forcing. We are burning through the Pliocene and heading towards a Miocene-like future,” said another of the authors, Gavin Foster, a professor of isotope geochemistry at the University of Southampton. “We now have to go further back in time to find situations that are relevant.” During the Middle Miocene, ice sheets shrank further and sea levels were much higher than the Pliocene. Foster said this was long before anything recognisably human had evolved on Earth. The steady increase in temperatures in the current era were highlighted on Thursday by a new international collaboration coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization and led by the UK’s Met Office. In the first of what will be an annually annually-updated five-year climate prediction, the scientists noted that there is a 20% chance of the world temporarily reaching 1.5C above pre-industrial levels before 2025. “This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the Paris agreement on climate change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5C,” said the WMO secretary-general, Petteri Taalas."

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: I got an angry e-mail from a reader who acted like he was offended by my likening the intolerance of warmists to that of the ISIS. The writer demanded that I get back to “a little bit of civility here”. Gee, I thought burning enemies was something Christians did hundreds of years ago, and so we ought not get so upset about it, at least that’s what President Obama told us. At any rate, I’ve decided to replace the IS image below with another that meets the warmists’ standards of civility. Happy now?
===================================
Unfortunately we live on the same planet as a couple of apocalyptic cults which find the existence of non-believers an affront to their particular belief system. One cult fantasises about executing non-believers, the other does it in imaginative ways. Both cults need to believe in hidden things. Both are best avoided.”
– David Archibald

IS propaganda image. What zealot warmists really fantasize of doing to dissenters. Source: cropped from here.
Distinguished scientist Willie Soon has become the target of a nasty smear job led by Justin Gillis of the hopelessly biased New York Times. It is not so much that the Smithsonian professor dared to question climate science orthodoxy (which is what science is all about to start with), but rather that his questions have yet to be answered. Thus Soon is viewed as a threat and so he has been condemned a heretic by the global warming cultists. And so ensues the orchestrated attempt by the New York Times, and the usual suspect web of alarmist scientists and activists, to cage-burn Soon’s reputation as a scientist.
Sideshow rather than scientific debate
Obviously the strain brought on by the embarrassment of the 18-year global warming pause and the unexpected record winter weather has been taking its toll on the global warming apostles and the desperate activist media outlets. The supposedly settled science apparently has more than its share of prickly thorns in its side.
Instead of arguing the science point by point, the New York Times led by Gillis prefer to create a diversionary side show: Soon’s reputation gets put in a cage that is to be set afire as the science goes ignored.
The activist past of Justin Gillis
Gillis’s brand of one-sided, highly activist and aid-and-abet journalism on behalf of end-of-world theorist scientists is hardly new. His true identity was exposed, for example, in his attempt to go after distinguished MIT professor Richard Lindzen. Christopher Horner writes of collusion at the Washington Examiner:
Gillis wrote a piece in May laboring to undermine one of the most highly credentialed and respected climate ‘skeptics,’ the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Dr. Richard Lindzen. This front-page article prompted my request for information reflecting how the A&M professor and activist whom Gillis quoted was using his taxpayer-funded position.
The specific correspondence began when Gillis wrote that interviewing Lindzen for a piece on his area of expertise was ‘unavoidable,’ and ‘[s]o I need a really good bibliography of all the published science’ countering Lindzen’s position on cloud feedback — ‘that is, anything that stands as evidence against Lindzen’s claim that the feedback has to be strongly negative.’
Remember, this was a reporter for the New York Times writing this. In the released emails, Gillis comes off as an activist posing as a journalist, sneering at Lindzen. Of another prominent skeptic, Gillis wrote, ‘I sense you’ve got him in a trap here … can’t wait to see it sprung.’ “

The Galileo treatment
The need to go after heretics who stand out is as old as humanity itself and is a seemingly incurable mental illness that has ailed human civilization from the start. Today, as David Archibald points out, it is starkly manifested by radical Islam. One illustrative scientific case from the past is the Trial of Galileo from some 400 years ago:
Galileo’s renunciation of Copernicanism ended with the words, “I affirm, therefore, on my conscience, that I do not now hold the condemned opinion and have not held it since the decision of authorities….I am here in your hands–do with me what you please.”
The parallels are stunning to say the least. Unfortunately Galileo was pretty much alone in his plight and did not have a blog.
Long list of warmists funded by Big Oil, industry
Of course Gillis writes as if questionable funding is only a problem one finds on the skeptic side, who in fact are massively underfunded compared to the global warming alarmists. Many skeptic blogs operate on volunteer basis. Recently NTZ exposed the massive funding the radical warmist elements get from Big Industry: Long List Of Warmist Organizations And Scientists Haul In Huge Money From Big Oil And Heavy Industry.
Earth to Gillis…Earth to Gillis..do you read?
Not only is the New York Times article just a sorrowful side-show, but it is one involving immature and juvenile elements. Prior to article appearing, taunting e-mails were anonymously sent to Professor Soon. It is not known who was behind the e-mails, but it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out it came from a circle close to the New York Times piece.
Pitiful attacks mean skeptics are winning
So what does Gillis’s sorrowful piece of journalism tell us? Most climate skeptics skeptics have become very familiarized with the words of Gandhi concerning being first ignored, then laughed at, and then attacked before finally emerging victorious. The attack on Willie Soon is just the latest sign of the warmists’ desperation. They know their science is just sinking refuse.

"**The heads of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google owner Alphabet appeared before US lawmakers on Wednesday night to defend their companies against claims they abuse their power to squash competitors.**
Here are five key moments from the hearing.
Did Facebook buy Instagram in 2012 to neutralise a threat? That was the topic raised by Democratic representative Jerry Nadler.
Emails between Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and his chief financial officer David Ebersman were revealed as part of the hearing.
In one, Mr Zuckerberg said: ""These businesses are nascent but the networks established, the brands are already meaningful, and if they grow to a large scale they could be very disruptive to us... I'm curious if we should consider going after one or two of them.""
Mr Ebersman asked if Mr Zuckerberg hoped to ""neutralise a potential competitor"".
Mr Zuckerberg replied it was a combination of that and hoping to improve Facebook's services.
In a follow-up email, he added: ""I didn't mean to imply we'd be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way"".
The slide presenting this email to Congress was titled ""Whoops!"", tech news site the Verge reported.
At Wednesday's hearing, Mr Zuckerberg said several international regulators - including the US Federal Trade Commission - had investigated the takeover at the time, and had decided not to block it.
In another email, he had said it would be a while before Facebook could afford to buy Google. At the hearing, Mr Zuckerberg said the comment was a joke.
Democratic congressman Henry Johnson raised concerns about Apple's App Store, suggesting its rules were sometimes ""changed to benefit Apple at the expense of [third-party] developers"" and also discriminated between different creators.
""Sir, we treat every developer the same,"" Apple chief executive Tim Cook responded.
""We have open and transparent rules... we do look at every app before it goes on. But those apps, those rules apply evenly to everyone.""
But emails between Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue and Amazon's Jeff Bezos showed that Apple agreed to halve its App Store commission to 15% to get Amazon's Prime Video onto its platform.
In April 2020, Apple introduced a scheme that let video-streaming platforms avoid the 30% fee if they integrated with other Apple products, as news site Bloomberg reported. Amazon is part of this deal.
In another email, sent a decade ago, Mr Cue suggested Apple could take a 40% cut rather than 30%.
""In the App Store's more than 10-year history, we have never raised the commission or added a single fee. In fact, we've reduced it for subscriptions and exempted additional categories of apps,"" Mr Cook told the hearing.
Several Republicans made allegations of anti-conservative bias on social media.
Republican congressman Jim Sensenbrenner asked Mark Zuckerberg why Twitter had removed a post by the US president's son, Donald Trump Jr, discussing the efficacy of the drug hydroxychloroquine.
Twitter is not owned by Facebook.
""I think what you might be referring to happened on Twitter, so it's hard for me to speak to that,"" said Mr Zuckerberg.
However, he added that Facebook did remove posts that could be directly harmful to people.
Republican congressman Jim Jordan suggested Google might tailor its features to aid Joe Biden's presidential campaign.
""Can you assure us you are not going to silence conservatives and... you're not going to configure your features [to favour] Joe Biden?"" asked Mr Jordan.
""You have my commitment. It's always been true and we'll continue to conduct ourselves in a neutral way,"" replied Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai.
Democrat Mary Gay Scanlon suggested Mr Jordan had been pushing ""fringe conspiracy theories"".
Mr Jordan reacted with fury, saying: ""We have the email - there were no fringe conspiracies.""
Later, Republican representative Greg Steube was teased online for asking Mr Pichai why his campaign emails were being marked as spam in Gmail.
Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal asked Jeff Bezos for a ""yes or no"" answer: Did Amazon ever use seller data to make its own business decisions?
This was a reference to reports that Amazon has used data gathered from businesses selling products via its site to design and price its own rival first-party goods - something the firm has previously suggested had been limited to a group of rogue employees.
Mr Bezos responded that he couldn't give an answer in such simple terms.
""What I can tell you is we have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private-label business, but I can't guarantee you that that policy has never been violated,"" he said.
Mr Bezos was not asked any questions for the first hour of the hearing, and was seen on the video call eating a snack.
He did get in one zinger near the end of the hearing, which may have been aimed at Mr Zuckerberg.
""It appears to me that social media is a nuance-destruction machine, and I don't think that's helpful for democracy,"" the Amazon founder said.
Republican congressman Matt Gaetz claimed that Google collaborates with Chinese universities that take ""millions upon millions of dollars from the Chinese military"" and noted that tech investor Peter Thiel had previously accused the company of ""treason"".
Sundar Pichai denied that his employees were acting against American interests.
""We are not working with the Chinese military, it's absolutely false,"" he said.
""What we do in China, compared to our peers, it's very very limited in nature. Our AI work in China is limited to a handful of people working on open-source projects.""
The four bosses were also asked a yes-or-no question by Republican Greg Steube: ""Do you believe the Chinese government is stealing technology from US companies?""
Tim Cook said: ""I don't know of specific cases where we have been stolen from by the government.""
Sundar Pichai first responded that he had ""no first-hand knowledge of any information stolen from Google in this regard,"" but later asked to correct the record as he remembered there had been a ""well-publicised cyber-attack"" originating from China.
Mark Zuckerberg said: ""I think it's well documented that the Chinese government steals technology from US companies.""
Jeff Bezos responded: ""I haven't seen that personally but I've heard many reports of it."""
"**Facebook accounts linked to the Islamic State group (ISIS) are still finding ways to evade detection on the social media platform, a new report claims.**
One network's tactics included mixing its material with content from real news outlets, such as recorded TV news output and the BBC News theme music.
It also hijacked Facebook accounts, and posted tutorial videos to teach other Jihadists how to do it.
Facebook said it had ""no tolerance for terrorist propaganda"".
The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which carried out the study, tracked 288 Facebook accounts linked to a particular ISIS network over three months.
The group behind them was able to exploit gaps in both the automated and manual moderation systems on Facebook, to generate tens of thousands of views of their material.
Facebook said all of them have now been removed.
Networks of ISIS supporters were also found to be plotting, preparing and launching 'raids' on other Facebook pages, including those belonging to the US military and political leaders.
The ISD researchers say they watched in real-time as instructions were posted for followers to flood comment sections of the sites with terrorist material.
One attack targeted US President Trump's Facebook page with fake African-American accounts. Another put images of the 11 September 2001 attack on the US Department of Defense and Air Force Academy pages, along with messages.
On 7 April, a series of Twitter accounts began to send out links to a Facebook Watch party.
The accounts all used the phrase 'Fuouaris Upload', a reference to medieval Islamic warriors.
The ISD researchers say this was part of a co-ordinated attempt to 'amass digital territory' on Facebook.
The network shared video content which received tens of thousands of views, and which extended out to other platforms with links to Telegram, WhatsApp, ISIS stand-alone websites and SoundCloud.
The researchers believe that at the centre of the network was one user who managed around a third (90 out of 288) of the Facebook profiles.
At times, this user would boast of holding 100 'war spoils' accounts, saying: ""They delete one account, and I replace it with 10 others.""
This was accomplished by generating real North American phone numbers and looking for associated Facebook accounts.
If it found a match it would request a re-set code to be sent to the phone number, so it could lock out the original account holder and use the Facebook profile to spread content.
The researchers say another key to the survival of ISIS content on the platform was the way in which ISIS supporters have learned to modify their content to evade controls.
This included:
Facebook has tried to develop ways of avoiding taking down mainstream news content which contains excerpts of ISIS material, and this was an attempt to take advantage of that.
In one case, an ISIS video was uploaded, but with 30 seconds of the France 24 news channel as an introduction before 49 minutes of the ISIS Iraq video.
In another case, a remix of a BBC News jingle with a pop song that became popular during the Coronavirus outbreak was used to mask ISIS content.
The researchers found that 70% of the ""Fuouaris Upload"" accounts were taken down during the nearly three-month period.
But the network adapted and survived relatively easily by shifting from one account to another.
As accounts were taken down, members of the network publicly mocked Facebook for not understanding the way they could operate on the platform.
The followers and friends of the main Facebook accounts included supporters from a number of different language groups, including Albanian, Turkish, Somali, Ethiopian and Indonesian communities.
The researchers say these accounts did not seem to be as heavily moderated as the Arabic and English ISIS accounts.
On one Indonesian language account the researchers found a video, set in a kitchen, featuring a man in a balaclava explaining how to create explosives using household items.
The video had been viewed 89 times and shared through 41 other Indonesian and Arabic language accounts, and flagged to Facebook.
""Our report is about the evasive behaviours of ISIS-supporting accounts on Facebook,"" the report's author Moustafa Ayad said.
""It is a deep dive into the inner workings of a singular terrorist-support network, connected to many others across the platform.
""The tactics we outline in our report are shifting as we speak. Without a clear understanding of these networks, and their behaviours, responses reliant on takedowns do little to quell ISIS-support expansion across our primary platforms.""
ISD says Facebook's automated and manual detection systems need to be updated, with proactive investigations into repeat offending accounts and their connections to other accounts on the platform.
It says the platform needs to re-examine account security protocols, and how these security measures are being actively subverted by users.
In response to the research, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""We had already removed more than 250 accounts referenced in ISD's research prior to it being reported to us and have also removed the remaining 30 accounts.
""We have no tolerance for terrorist propaganda on our platform, and remove content and accounts that violate our policy as soon as we identify them."""

UD catalyst can convert CO2 to CO with 92 percent efficiency
A team of researchers at the University of Delaware has developed a highly selective catalyst capable of electrochemically converting carbon dioxide — a greenhouse gas — to carbon monoxide with 92 percent efficiency. The carbon monoxide then can be used to develop useful chemicals.

The researchers recently reported their findings in Nature Communications.
“Converting carbon dioxide to useful chemicals in a selective and efficient way remains a major challenge in renewable and sustainable energy research,” according to Feng Jiao, assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and the project’s lead researcher.
Co-authors on the paper include Qi Lu, a postdoctoral fellow, and Jonathan Rosen, a graduate student, working with Jiao.
The researchers found that when they used a nano-porous silver electrocatalyst, it was 3,000 times more active than polycrystalline silver, a catalyst commonly used in converting carbon dioxide to useful chemicals.
Silver is considered a promising material for a carbon dioxide reduction catalyst because of it offers high selectivity — approximately 81 percent — and because it costs much less than other precious metal catalysts. Additionally, because it is inorganic, silver remains more stable under harsh catalytic environments.
The exceptionally high activity, Jiao said, is likely due to the UD-developed electrocatalyst’s extremely large and highly curved internal surface, which is approximately 150 times larger and 20 times intrinsically more active than polycrystalline silver.
Jiao explained that the active sites on the curved internal surface required a much smaller than expected voltage to overcome the activation energy barrier needed drive the reaction.
The resulting carbon monoxide, he continued, can be used as an industry feedstock for producing synthetic fuels, while reducing industrial carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 40 percent.
To validate whether their findings were unique, the researchers compared the UD-developed nano-porous silver catalyst with other potential carbon dioxide electrocatalysts including polycrystalline silver and other silver nanostructures such as nanoparticles and nanowires.
Testing under identical conditions confirmed the non-porous silver catalyst’s significant advantages over other silver catalysts in water environments.
Reducing greenhouse carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use is considered critical for human society. Over the last 20 years, electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction has attracted attention because of the ability to use electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and wave.
Ideally, Jiao said, one would like to convert carbon dioxide produced in power plants, refineries and petrochemical plants to fuels or other chemicals through renewable energy use.
A 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report stated that 19 percent of greenhouse gas emissions resulted from industry in 2004, according to the Environmental Protection Agency’s website.
“Selective conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide is a promising route for clean energy but it is a technically difficult process to accomplish,” said Jiao. “We’re hopeful that the catalyst we’ve developed can pave the way toward future advances in this area.”
The research team’s work is supported through funding from the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund and University of Delaware Research Foundation. Jiao has patented the novel application technique in collaboration with UD’s Office of Economic Innovation and Partnerships.

"**Facebook says it mistakenly let 5,000 developers gather information from people's profiles after a time limit on their rights had expired.**
Apps on Facebook are supposed to be prevented from accessing people's personal data if the app has not been used for 90 days.
But Facebook said that lock-out had not always worked due to a flaw in how it recorded inactivity.
""We fixed the issue the day after we found it,"" the company said.
Facebook has not stated how many users had their personal data scraped.
The harvesting of Facebook users' personal information by third-party apps was at the centre of the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal that was exposed in 2018.
Cambridge Analytica's app on Facebook had harvested not only the data of people who interacted with it, but also that of friends who had not given consent. The company built a vast and lucrative database in the process.
Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg faced questioning before the US Congress on how his company dealt with users' personal information, and Facebook brought in its new policy on 90-day lock-outs for apps later that year.
But Facebook now says the limit did not work properly.
""Recently, we discovered that in some instances apps continued to receive the data that people had previously authorised, even if it appeared they hadn't used the app in the last 90 days,"" the company said in a statement.
Facebook gave an example of the error in action. It said that if two Facebook friends had both used an app, and only one was still using it after 90 days, the app might gather personal information from the inactive friend.
""For example, this could happen if someone used a fitness app to invite their friends from their home town to a workout, but we didn't recognise that some of their friends had been inactive for many months,"" the company said.
In that example, the home town of a user would be the personal information in question. Facebook cited language and gender as other examples.
The company said its estimate of 5,000 developers was only based on data available from the last few months.
But it also said that the information handed out, even if it was after the time limit, was only what users gave permission for when they signed up to the app in the first place.
In the same blog post, Facebook also announced that it was changing its platform terms and developer policies ""to ensure businesses and developers clearly understand their responsibility to safeguard data and respect people's privacy"".
The faulty time limit in this announcement is the most recent in a long line of privacy issues for the social network.
In November last year, a flaw in Facebook's Groups feature was revealed. It allowed the harvesting of some personal data from groups.
Figures announced in January showed that Facebook's annual profit fell in 2019, for the first time five years - partly due to settlements with regulators over privacy concerns."

A new pharaoh is rising in Egypt. Gen. Abdel Fata al‐​Sisi is preparing to grasp supreme power, most likely as the country’s next president. He is posing as democracy’s savior while his troops detain or kill those opposing him. The arrests and shootings continued during last week’s constitutional referendum.   
  
  
During the Cold War the U.S. stole Cairo away from the Soviet Union. When revolution loomed in 2011 the administration endorsed dictator Hosni Mubarak, before trying to work with newly elected President Mohammed Morsi. But the latter failed to expand his popular appeal and discredited the Muslim Brotherhood, making his defeat almost certain in the next poll.   
  
  
However, Gen. Sisi and his confederates were in a hurry to seize power and staged a coup. Although the Brotherhood was not without blame, the military killed hundreds or more in the August crackdown in Cairo. Since then thousands more have died and been arrested.   
  
  
As I noted in my latest Forbes online column:   




The putative pharaoh has been actively restoring the Ancien Regime. Gen. Sisi has tapped military officials as provincial gauleiters, recreated Mubarak’s secret and intelligence police, reinstituted military trials, enacted strict new restrictions on demonstrations, arrested journalists, deployed private thugs against Morsi supporters and regime critics, and prosecuted protestors.



McClatchy’s Amina Ismail and Nancy Youssef reported: “Egyptians caught in the roundup have told McClatchy they were tortured while awaiting charges.” The new constitution maintains the military’s privileged status and protects repressive state institutions from outside control.   
  
  
The press has been a special military target. The Committee on Academic Freedom of the Middle East Studies Association cited a “worsening climate for free speech and peaceable assembly.”   
  
  
Overall, human rights activists say the situation is worse than under Mubarak. Gamel al‐​Eid of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information argued that the military was sending a message: “There is only one choice—to support the military or to be in jail.”   
  
  
The regime hopes to destroy the Brotherhood. However, the group withstood decades of repression before and emerged strong enough to win Egypt’s first legislative and presidential elections. Moreover, by confirming the extremist critique that democracy is a fool’s errand, Gen. Sisi has left opponents of his incipient dictatorship little choice but to use violence.   
  
  
The Mubarak regime’s crackdown on the Brotherhood four decades ago sparked the formation of new radical groups, including al‐​Qaeda. Before joining that organization current leader Ayman al‐​Zawahiri was tortured by the Mubarak regime.   
  
  
Violent opposition to Gen. Sisi’s incipient dictatorship is rising. Policemen are being killed while bombings are increasing in frequency. Worse for America, warned Max Boot: “as long as Washington is seen on the side of the generals, some of their violence will be directed our way.”   
  
  
However, the administration still refuses to call a coup a coup. It reluctantly withheld portions of the $1.55 billion in annual foreign aid, while assuring Cairo that doing so was not “punitive.” Then the administration pushed to relax aid conditions.   
  
  
But most of the roughly $75 billion given to Cairo over the years enriched political and military elites and funded the purpose of prestige weapons from American arms makers. The U.S. never received much “leverage” in return. For instance, the knowledge that the Egyptian military would cease to exist after a war with Israel, not American money, kept the peace.   
  
  
Anyway, the U.S. had no credibility to enforce conditions since it never was willing to stop the money. The administration finally (kind of) did so last fall, but if America runs back to Cairo, cash‐​in‐​hand, the former will never again have the slightest hint of leverage. Moreover, the regime now is flooded with money from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states and doesn’t need American assistance.   
  
  
Worse, underwriting a murderous regime inevitably stains the hands of American policymakers. Who can believe Washington’s lectures on human rights when it is funding a grotesquely repressive regime in Egypt?   
  
  
America should exit the Egyptian imbroglio.

No, not your suppositories, your presuppositions. We all have them whether we realise it or not. A presupposition is something that we accept as true, without necessarily having proof. A case in point is presuppositional apologetics. There are two theological presuppositions: “In the beginning God…” or “In the beginning, not God …” Neither can be definitively proved, but one of those two starting points governs your life, your beliefs, your actions, your decisions, your character. 



This post is not intended as a theological treatise but the comparison is probably valid, so stick with me for a bit as we look at an example dialogue.



 **Allen** : I am an atheist and evolutionist. Prove to me there is a God.  
 **Paul** : I do not think I can do that because of your presuppositions.  
 **Allen** : Why not?  
 **Paul** : Because your presuppositions will not allow you to examine, without bias, the evidence that I present to you for God’s existence.  
 **Allen** : That is because there is no evidence for God’s existence.  
 **Paul** : See! There you go. You just confirmed what I was stating.  
 **Allen** : How so?  
 **Paul** : Your presupposition is that there is no God; therefore, no matter what I might present to you to show His existence, you must interpret it in a manner consistent with your presupposition: namely, that there is no God. If I were to have a video tape of God coming down from heaven, you’d say it was a special effect. If I had a thousand eye-witnesses saying they saw Him, you’d say it was mass-hysteria. If I had Old Testament prophecies fulfilled in the New Testament, you’d say they were forged, dated incorrectly, or not real prophecies. So, I cannot prove anything to you since your presupposition won’t allow it. It is limited.  
 **Allen** : It is not limited.  
 **Paul** : Yes, it is. Your presupposition cannot allow you to rightly determine God’s existence from evidence– providing that there were factual proofs of His existence. Don’t you see? If I DID have incontrovertible proof, your presupposition would force you to interpret the facts consistently with your presupposition; and you would not be able to see the proof.  
 **Allen** : I see your point, but I am open to being persuaded if you can.  
 **Paul** : Then, I must ask you, what kind of evidence would you accept that would prove God’s existence? I must see what your presuppositions are and work either with them or against them.   
_(Thanks to[CARM](https://carm.org/presuppositional-apologetics) for the dialogue)_



So where is this little side-track taking us?



Let’s examine another presupposition.



 **The role of the IPCC is to assess** on a comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of **human-induced climate change** , its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. IPCC reports should be neutral with respect to policy, although they may need to deal objectively with scientific, technical and socio-economic factors relevant to the application of particular policies. 



The IPCC was set up with the presupposition that climate change is human-induced, otherwise known as man-made, or anthropogenic. The quote above is the IPCC’s defined role for the principles governing its work.



Let’s go back to the dialogue above:



 **Allen** : I am an IPCC report writer (or a Green, or Simon Bridges). Prove to me that climate change is not man-made.  
 **Paul** : I do not think I can do that because of your presuppositions.  
 **Allen** : Why not?  
 **Paul** : Because your presuppositions will not allow you to examine, without bias, the evidence that I present to you of other factors possibly causing global warming or cooling.  
 **Allen** : That is because there is no evidence for anything other than the effect of CO2.  
 **Paul** : See! There you go. You just confirmed what I was stating.  
 **Allen** : How so?  
 **Paul** : Your presupposition is that CO2 causes climate change; therefore, no matter what I might present to you to show how the sun might be a factor, you must interpret it in a manner consistent with your presupposition: namely, that CO2 is the cause, the models say so (and so on). So, I cannot prove anything to you since your presupposition won’t allow it. It is limited.  
 **Allen** : It is not limited.  
 **Paul** : Yes, it is. Your presupposition cannot allow you to rightly determine the cause from evidence. Don’t you see? If I DID have incontrovertible proof, your presupposition would force you to interpret the facts consistently with your presupposition; and you would not be able to see the proof. 



If the IPCC man-made climate crisis believers finally did come up with one single example of verifiable physical evidence that the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide in our planet’s atmosphere is causing a climate crisis, would our presuppositions allow us to accept that evidence?

"How did a billionaire win over coal miners in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to become president? Three words: “Trump digs coal”. By linking deindustrialisation and the decline of working communities in America’s “rust belt” to environmental regulation, Donald Trump could paint his greener rivals as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans. Never mind that climate change and pollution will hit working class people hardest – when it’s “jobs or the planet”, the former will always be a more immediate worry for the precarious and impoverished. It needn’t be that way though. The campaign for One Million Climate Jobs, organised by the Campaign against Climate Change Trade Union Group, has put workers at the forefront of its vision for tackling the climate crisis. The proposals for a Green New Deal in the US and the UK are supported by trade unions which represent millions of workers. Both projects demand jobs are protected and new ones created as part of a “just transition” from the carbon economy.

      Labour's Green New Deal is among the most radical in the world – but can it be done by 2030?


 The Trade Union Congress (TUC) backed the September 20 day of international climate strikes and millions of workers joined the protests that school students had launched. This kind of mass mobilisation will be crucial to climate action and the role trade unions play will be indispensable. But worker-led environmentalism isn’t a recent phenomenon – the history of labour and green movements are intertwined. Trump’s “workers-versus-the-planet” framing misunderstands the origins of the climate crisis, which go back to the private enclosure of common land in the UK. This forced people from rural areas and into crowded urban slums, creating the first proletariat. Once there, industrialists switched from water-powered mills to coal-powered factories to intensify the work routines of these new urban workers.   Coal powered travel helped bosses find cheaper labour overseas and strengthened their authority over an insurgent working class. At every step, workers resisted this transition. The high point of this long battle was the English plug riots of 1842 – viewed as the world’s first general strike – when textile workers literally pulled the plug on the coal-fired boilers of their factories. In their new urban grimescapes, workers suffered from the toxic raw materials and effluence of the factories they worked in. Class determined whether city dwellers lived in the smog around chimneys or with clean air in leafy suburbs, and it still does.  Born out of the acute stress of living in polluted and disease-ridden slums, working class movements won public health reforms that have became the standard, such as proper sanitation and rubbish disposal. Working class people have always valued nature in leisure time too, whether it’s cycling, fishing, pigeon-fancying, dog walking or tending allotments.  Unions have long campaigned against workplace hazards, and it’s workers who fight the impacts of climate change every day. Firefighters risk their lives to rescue people from more frequent flooding and wildfires and the Fire Brigades Union has campaigned against staff cuts, inadequate levels of equipment and a lack of training to deal with hazards like polluted floodwater. Environmental struggles litter labour history, but they’re not always the stories you read about. The modern environmental movement emerged, to a large extent, from Rachael Carson’s brilliant Silent Spring – a book published in 1962 which revealed the devastating ecological consequences of pesticides in post-war America. But the book overlooked the acute burden on vulnerable agricultural workers who are forced to use these chemicals.

      Climate change: narrate a history beyond the 'triumph of humanity' to find imaginative solutions


 During a spectacular organising drive and protests by the United Farm Workers in the 1960s, union leader Cesar Chavez exposed the damage these toxins caused to Latino labourers, winning concessions from their employers and standing up for them against anti-migrant racism. Today, the shipyard that built the Titanic – Harland and Wolff in Belfast – is threatened with closure, but its workers are defiant. They demand that the shipyards be nationalised and used to create renewable energy infrastructure. This offers an exciting glimpse of the leading role that workers can take in the enfolding response to the climate crisis. Elsewhere in the world, labour organisations have allied with indigenous people against developments that threaten their lands and destroy the local environment. In British Columbia, unions supported First Nation resistance to pipelines and tar sands oil extraction, while the rubber tappers’ union demonstrated against destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Such a broad alliance is needed to tackle climate change, and that means mobilising labour in its widest sense – women in the household economy, the rural poor, indigenous people, fishing communities, the unemployed and school students. Equally, understanding the configuration of power and ideology that drives the fossil fuel economy – big businesses, geopolitical rivalry over oil and gas resources, nationalistic buck-passing, corporate PR and those who blame overpopulation. With CO₂ emissions rising, there’s little time to waste.  Working class environmentalism is part of the solution to the climate crisis. If successful, the movement will give new meaning to the old maxim: “the cause of labour is the hope of the world”. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe German renewable energy bubble has collapsed since the government rolled back subsidies for a variety of green energy sources such as solar and biogas in 2014. Especially for solar.
German alarmist website klimaretter.de here reports that solar energy installations have reached a new 8-year low. According to the BDI German Federal Power Agency, in February this year only 100 megawatts of capacity were installed. This is 11% less than what was installed a year earlier, and much less than during the heydays earlier in the decade.
In 2014 the German government reformed its EEG energy feed-in act with the aim of limiting the annual amount of added solar capacity coming online to between 2400 to 2600 megawatts. Last year not even 1900 megawatts were added, klimaretter writes.
As the solar industry collapses in Germany, it is however faring much better worldwide, with USA and China leading the way in adding capacity. Experts expect between 53,000 and 57,000 megawatts of solar capacity to be added globally this year.
Wind turbines losing screws
Meanwhile a wind turbine was temporarily shut down when nearby residents heard loud, clunking noises for days and then found several 4-inch, quarter-pound stray bolts on the ground in western Germany near the border to France (see photo at link that follows.
According to the online volksfreund.de site, a repair crew was dispatched to repair the problem. Apparently there was “damage to the brake system that serves to arrest the rotor blades”. One of the screws fell inside the blade and caused the racket.
The local environment ministry reports that the problem has been solved and there is no longer any danger to residents.
Good thing no one was near when the damn bolts fell out!

"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at rolling back   financial regulations. The rules of the   Act were intended to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Democrats and consumer groups called Mr. Trump’s orders a gift to Wall Street. A government lawyer said more than 100, 000 visas were revoked by the Trump administration as part of the president’s ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The State Department said the number was “fewer than 60, 000. ” And Kellyanne Conway, the president’s adviser, said she erred when she talked about a “Bowling Green massacre” that never occurred. _____ 2. Confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees will pick up next week. Betsy DeVos, the nominee for education secretary, is expected to have a final,   confirmation vote on Tuesday. After Ms. DeVos seemed ignorant of major provisions of education law, some Senate offices reported receiving more calls opposing Ms. DeVos than any other Trump nominee. _____ 3. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump questioned a deal to bring migrants held by Australia into the United States as refugees. But on Thursday, his spokesman said he would honor the deal. Here is a video of what daily life looks like for one of them, a Kurdish dissident from Iran. He has been held on Manus Island for over three years. “Take us from this hellhole prison,” he pleads. _____ 4. As the New England Patriots seek their fifth N. F. L. championship this weekend, controlling the explosive Atlanta Falcons  —   who are looking for their first title  —   will be a major challenge. Here is a look at the championship matchup in Houston and who we think will win. Now, what to cook for the game. Our collection of Super Bowl recipes includes dips, chicken wings, potato skins, chilis, cheese steaks, nachos and vegetarian options. _____ 5. A little more than a week ago, François Fillon seemed all but certain to become France’s next president. Now he’s in deep trouble for payments of nearly $1 million from the public payroll to his wife and children. The scandal has tapped a wellspring of anger in the French electorate and called into question the standard operating procedures of the political class. The country has been in a state of emergency since the 2015 terror attack in Paris. Early Friday, a man shouting “God is great” in Arabic, tried to attack soldiers outside the Louvre. He was shot and no one else was injured. _____ 6. Photos and video from a spectacular sight off the coast of Hawaii circulated on social media this week. The images showed hundreds of millions of gallons of lava flowing into the ocean, like blood from a ruptured artery. Visible lava streams usually last only a day. This one began on New Year’s Eve and ended on Thursday, when a seacliff collapsed and cut it off. _____ 7. More young women are smoking pot while they’re pregnant. Most think it’s harmless. But preliminary research suggests otherwise. Experts say marijuana’s main psychoactive ingredient, THC, can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. (If you’ve used marijuana while pregnant, we’d like to hear from you. We won’t publish any of the information without your permission.) _____ 8. We’re doing a series on the “lions of New York,” the movers and shakers who helped shape the city’s comeback from the depths of crisis in the 1970s and ’80s. This week we speak with Harry Belafonte, the   singer and a pillar of the civil rights movement. At 89, he is anxious about voting rights, police violence and the state of the movement he helped build. _____ 9. Sales of George Orwell’s “1984” are up since the election. And now it’s coming to Broadway. Producers plan to bring an adaptation of the 1949 novel to the Hudson Theater in June. It was previously staged in Britain. There’s no word on the cast yet. _____ 10. Finally, if you’re planning on warming up the couch before the Super Bowl, here are the latest recommendations from “Watching,” our team of TV and movie experts. They’ve compiled a list of the best movies and TV shows on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and HBO in February, and a guide to your options depending on how much time you have. One of their top picks is Netflix’s “Santa Clarita Diet,” starring Drew Barrymore, above, as a zombie. Have a great weekend. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

"Air pollution has remained at lower levels in UK towns and cities despite a return to near-normal traffic levels after the easing of coronavirus restrictions, according to research. Analysis of data from more than 100 urban roadside locations shows nitrogen dioxide pollution levels were 30% below normal at the end of June, despite HGV traffic being back at 95% of normal levels, vans at 90% and cars at 75%. Scientists think the small reduction in traffic that remains is enough to cut congestion on the roads and that this has an outsized impact in reducing dirty air. People may be staggering their commutes to work, which would also cut congestion, they said. David Carslaw from the University of York, who led the analysis, said the finding could help cities improve the way they cut pollution and that this is particularly important during the pandemic, given the growing evidence that dirty air could make Covid-19 more deadly. Nitrogen dioxide is mainly emitted by diesel vehicles and has been at illegal levels in most urban areas since 2010. It is responsible for an estimated 23,500 early deaths every year. At the height of the lockdown, NO2 levels plunged by 56%, as traffic fell to levels last seen in 1955. “Things are not back to normal according to the air quality data,” said Carslaw. “We think a big part of that is the effect of congestion.” Congestion ramps up emissions because vehicles are forced to repeatedly accelerate and brake, as well as sitting in one location in between. “Everyone would appreciate improved air quality and this suggests we don’t need such savage reductions in road traffic [as seen during lockdown] to achieve that. If you can reduce traffic by 10-20% and remove a lot of the congestion, that may have a disproportionate effect on the emissions.” The impact of congestion on air pollution is difficult to study because of its chaotic nature and the fact that emissions control systems on vehicles perform differently at different speeds. “There isn’t a great deal of data on how congestion affects air pollution,” said Gary Fuller of Imperial College London, who was not involved in the analysis. But he said congestion was a plausible cause of the lowered air pollution. Carslaw’s team used statistical tools to account for the effect of variable weather, which affects pollution levels. The data will help scientists to understand the link between congestion and air pollution. “It’s timely that we understand it better,” said Carslaw. “The last thing we want during the Covid-19 pandemic is increased air pollution as well, either for people that are currently suffering or who may be susceptible. There’s a strong reason to make sure air pollution is low during this period.” Different types of vehicle emit different levels of pollution. Stricter regulation of HGVs means they can emit less pollution than diesel cars, which could indicate that reduced car traffic is the most important factor. However, Carslaw said congestion was the most likely reason for the lower than expected pollution levels. The UK government’s advisers said last week that air pollution was likely to be increasing the number and severity of Covid-19 infections. This followed calls from MPs for action and a warning from lawyers that the government had a legal obligation to urgently review its air quality strategy. An air pollution inquiry by a select committee of MPs is also examining delays in the rollout of clean air zones in cities as a result of the pandemic."
"Greenhouse gas emissions from Australian cars slumped by more than a third and emissions from aircraft dropped by three-quarters as the country went into partial lockdown in April, cutting national carbon pollution by about 7% for the month, an audit has found. It confirmed that the recession will lead to a notable fall in national emissions this year. But experts believe the drop is likely to be limited and could be short-term given much of the economy – including big industry and manufacturing – has largely continued to operate through the coronavirus pandemic and road transport has begun to increase.  The Australia Institute, which publishes the monthly national energy emissions audit by independent energy analyst Hugh Saddler, said transport emissions are likely to rebound unless the Morrison government releases and backs policies it has promised to support electric vehicles and improve fuel quality. Saddler, a consultant and honorary associate professor at ANU’s Crawford School of Public Policy, found transport emissions fell sharply due to a 36% fall in sales of petrol, liquified petroleum gas (LPG) and diesel used in light vehicles and a 77% drop in domestic aviation fuel consumption. The fall in transport emissions was about 3m tonnes. It is equivalent to about 7% of total monthly national emissions, 5% of annual transport emissions and 0.6% of total annual national emissions. Emissions from electricity fell another 1.9m tonnes, but Saddler found this was not due to Covid-19. While official data suggests industrial and small business energy use dropped in April and May, household use increased as people stayed home. Saddler said the two changes effectively cancelled each other out, leaving total electricity consumption mostly unchanged, save for a slight fall due to the weather being more mild this year than last. Where there has been a change is in the mix of types of electricity. The proportion of coal-fired power in the national electricity grid, not counting rooftop solar, fell to 66% – the first time it has fallen below 70% since the introduction of a centralised power supply. The share of renewable energy grew to about 25%, reflecting the surge of investment in large-scale solar and wind in 2017 and 2018 triggered by the 23% national renewable energy target. Spending on new large-scale renewable energy fell by about 50% last year after that target was met and not renewed. Saddler said the fall in transport emissions was as extraordinary and historic as the event that caused it. “Obviously that’s completely predictable and expected,” he said. He said carbon dioxide from cars – the biggest chunk of transport emissions – was likely to rebound as cars returned to roads across most of the country, but it was difficult to assess what impact the greater number of people working from home would have on that. “It will come back up, but will go back to up to where it was? I’m not sure,” Saddler said. Richie Merzian, Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said data in the report highlighted the reduction in emissions that would possible if governments addressed transport pollution. He said there was no policy to address emissions from the sector, with a national electric vehicle strategy having been delayed, a liquid fuel security review completed but yet to be released and nothing happening to improve fuel quality. He said Australia, without an auto-manufacturing industry, was a “car-taker not car-maker” and risked being unprepared if it did not plan as global car companies shifted to electric vehicles. “Now is the ideal time to drive change in our transport sector by electrifying our cars and buses,” he said. “The federal government could be investing in necessary infrastructure to smooth the inevitable transition away from fossil-fuelled transport, while building the know-how and jobs Australia needs for our electric future.” Analyses before Covid-19 hit suggested the government was not on track to meet its 2030 emissions reduction target – a 26-28% cut below 2005 levels – without using a carbon accounting loophole. According to revised emissions data, national emissions were down just 1.5% since the Coalition was elected in 2013."
"The idea of a four-day working week is gaining traction. Recently, several high-profile companies have trialled reduced hours. And in the UK, the Labour Party has pledged a 32-hour four day work week within ten years should it come to power.  A number of research studies, including one by my colleagues and I, show clear benefits such as improvements in employee satisfaction and productivity, savings on commuter costs, and fewer days absent through sickness.  However, this wave of interest in a four-day week is no longer just about worker wellbeing – it is also about the environmental impact.  Several reports and commentators have identified various ways a four-day week could reduce our carbon footprint. Using data from 1970 to 2007 for 29 OECD member nations, a 2012 study found that a 10% reduction in work hours may lead to declines in ecological footprint, carbon footprint, and CO₂ emissions by 12.1%, 14.6% and 4.2% respectively. Where would these savings come from? The most direct way a four-day week could cut emissions is by reducing carbon-intensive commutes, and our study indicated this has significant potential for a “green” dividend.  Our research was based on a sample of 505 business leaders and owners, representing a variety of different sized organisations, and a separate sample of 2,063 adults, designed to reflect the UK in terms of age, gender and religion. We asked everyone how a four-day week would affect their commuting habits and then applied their answers to DfT National Road Traffic Survey data. We found that, if we scaled up the results to apply to the UK, a national four-day working week would reduce the number of miles driven by employees travelling to work by 558 million each week. This in turn would reduce fuel consumption and travel costs. In this scenario, car mileage could reduce as much as 9%. More than half (51%) of employees said they would drive their car less, most commonly reducing weekly mileage by 10-19 miles. Less time spent in traffic is good news for other reasons: it can lead to health benefits, lowering the demand for carbon-intensive healthcare products and services such as hospital treatments, visits to GP or medications. Avoiding the stress and anxiety of a traffic jam is also good for mental health, especially among women. With a three-day weekend, there are more opportunities for workers to exercise, spend time outdoors or do others things that improve their physical and mental health. This in turn means less demand for carbon-producing healthcare services. Working one day less per week means less need for goods and services we use daily in the workplace. Computers and machinery will last longer, stationary and uniforms won’t need replacing as often, cleaners won’t need to work as much, and so on. There will be less need to produce these goods and services using carbon-intensive technologies and natural resources. It’s potentially a virtuous cycle, as a better environment with less pollutants can improve productivity levels. Therefore, environmental benefits from four-day week can also be viewed as an investment in human capital. A four-day week can also have some negative environmental impacts. Policies and strategies are needed to minimise the adverse effects and maximise the “green” dividends. Net benefits depend on how workers use the three-day weekend. If they use that extra day off to take a flight for a short break, drive a fancy sports car, or even to watch TV at home with the heating or air-conditioning cranked right up, then those fewer working hours could even be bad for the environment. A four-day week may not achieve the full range of benefits if the work of five days is crammed into four days with longer hours (as happened in one experiment in the US state of Utah). Workers may have to prioritise tasks and work longer hours. This can cause anxieties, performance-related stress and an increase in demand for health services. Unaffordable house prices across many parts of the UK, along with slow wage growth, means any loss of income due to a four-day week may force workers to top up their salaries with extra jobs. This would negate the environmental benefits of that supposed day off. New technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics can lead to productivity gains, and we need to utilise this wisely if a four-day week is to achieve the same output as the standard five days without job or income losses.  If workers are to spend their extra free time boosting their health and wellbeing, then we’ll also need further investments into less carbon-intensive infrastructures. That means better public transport, more parks, libraries, community centres, sports facilities. It is crucial that workers understand the full range of issues of four-day weeks. Organisations should invest and provide support, and appropriate training programmes should be rolled out. Finally, workers must be willing to change their perspectives and make positive behavioural changes. This would make the four-day week concept work for them, their families, their employers and for the environment. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe debate on the effects of infrasound on the health of people and animals living near wind parks has been raging on with more intensity than ever – especially since Denmark unexpectedly halted the permitting of new wind parks due to “health concerns” from infrasound.
Infrasound is defined as low frequency sound under 16 Hz – below the threshold of human hearing. Wind farms are notorious for generating these potentially harmful sub-audible frequencies. It is said that infrasound can be sensed as pressure to the ears or to the stomach, or as a slight vibration.
There’s a Swedish report available on the hazard, click here. It calls for the legal framework for the creation of wind parks to be revised.
German NTV public television reports recently that in Denmark mink farm operator Kaj Bank Olesen from Herning is a neighbor to four large-scale wind turbines only 330 meters away. Olesen and other neighbors had protested the planning of the wind turbines, fearing negative consequences from their noise and shadows.
However the community rejected their claims, basing it on a lack of credibility. The turbines were installed. Now it seems that Olesen’s earlier fears may have had merit as he claims that the infrasound generated by the turbines are making the mink animals on the farm aggressive and is leading them to die. After one night he found 200 dead minks the next morning. The incident has since sparked the Danish government to take action. Permitting of wind parks in Denmark is now on hold.
The alleged health impacts from wind turbines have been making the news (0:55) in Germany as well.
In Schleswig Holstein, Germany, the Hogeveens have been forced to sleep and eat in their basement in a desperate attempt to find refuge from the maddening infrasound emitted by recently installed turbines near their home.
The wind industry and many government authorities deny there’s a connection between infrasound from wind turbines and health impacts on humans. Hermann Albers of a wind lobby group says there’s no connection between the turbines and the irritation sensed by those living close by, claiming that it is a “subjective” perception or that it’s “politically motivated”. In other words, people living close to wind turbines are just making it all up and they should instead just shut up and live with it.

//-->




The German government says it will study the matter further and consider if infrasound should be taken into consideration during the wind park permitting process.
In Australia a link has also been found between wind turbines and health in the so-called Cape Bridgewater report. Steven Cooper investigated the possible link, saying that availbale data so far is very small, but adds:
There’s definitely a trend. There’s definitely a connection between the operation of a wind form and what the residents were identifying as disturbances, and so it’s definitely open to debate as to what the cause or link is in terms of that data.”
Data from comprehensive studies are difficult to come by. Wind farms are reluctant to share their data with researchers, fearing unfavorable results and consequences.
The impacts from infrasound on human health will continue to be debated in the future. But other things are already sure and beyond debate: Wind farms are rapidly losing their attractiveness and support from the public due to their poor performance, hazard to birdlife, ruining of property values, and their blighting of the natural landscape.
An adverse connection to human health would be yet another large nail in the coffin of the now increasingly controversial wind industry.

"The UK’s Labour Party has pledged to offer voters a Green New Deal at the next election. This is a radical programme for decarbonising society and the economy by 2030, through phasing out fossil fuels, investing in renewable energy and creating a public works programme to build the zero-carbon infrastructure of the future. In my recent report, A Green New Deal for Nature, I argued that giving land back to nature could be another part of this vision. Restoring forests and other natural habitats to 25% of the UK’s land surface could sequester 14% of the UK’s annual greenhouse gas emissions each year. As emissions are scaled down and these ecosystems expand, they could continue to remove much greater quantities of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in future. Often called “natural climate solutions”, restoring forests and wetlands draws carbon down from the atmosphere and stores it in the tissue of new vegetation and soil. On a large scale, and alongside leaving fossil fuels in the ground, this could help to limit global heating to well below 2°C. These habitats can be restored through rewilding, which means giving natural processes a helping hand by stopping the draining of peatland for example, or letting a woodland regrow. Reintroducing species that were once extinct in a region can also help ecosystems regenerate. While letting nature take care of itself isn’t appropriate in all cases, rewilding is one of the most powerful and cost-effective ways to resist climate breakdown and wildlife loss at the same time. But what might that look like in practice?

 For wildlife, it’s important that restored habitats are connected. Linked habitats allow plants and animals to move more easily as temperatures rise and rainfall patterns change. If species can migrate through green corridors to cooler areas, they could avoid local extinctions. This could mean a network of expanded hedgerows and woodland that criss-crosses the land, connecting wild habitats and ensuring species can migrate safely between them.  Other changes include reintroducing European beavers to flood plains to help manage flood risks. In remote places like the Scottish Highlands, wolves could return to keep herbivores in check and help woodlands rebound, increasing their long-term potential to store carbon. Rewilding instead of burning or draining carbon-rich peatlands would allow their vegetation and carbon stocks to recover. Wildlife, from insects to birds and large mammals, would have space to flourish. The UK would switch from being one of the world’s most nature-depleted countries to a green and vibrant land. This may sound utopian, but it’s not. The UK is a densely populated country, and with 72% of the land area used for agriculture, it might seem that there’s little room for anything else. But less than 20% of the UK is occupied by crops or dense urban communities, so 80% of it could be better managed for nature and storing carbon.  Some 45% of the UK’s land surface is given to grazing livestock. The poorest land for agricultural productivity is only farmed because of taxpayer subsidies. Meanwhile, about 13% of the UK is allocated to grouse-shooting and deer-stalking, often on degraded peatlands that are managed at huge environmental cost for the benefit of a tiny number of hunters. This land is currently of little value for food production, but it could store plenty of carbon if rewilded. 


      Read more:
      Rewilding is essential to the UK’s commitment to zero carbon emissions


 The exact locations should be the subject of local knowledge and consultation, but reducing grazing land from 45% of the UK to 33% and returning that 12% to wild habitat could provide half of the carbon storage needed. Restoring half of the UK’s peatlands could add 6% more land, alongside protecting the 7% of the UK that is already broadleaf woodlands and wildflower meadows. Together, this would make 25% of the UK’s land a refuge for wildlife and a vast reservoir of CO₂. Farm subsidies currently give £3 billion to UK farmers ever year. By some estimates, subsidies are half the income of many farmers. After Brexit, this money could be given to farmers to reward them for storing carbon and rewilding, making this more financially viable than grazing on agriculturally poor land. Economy-wide carbon taxes could also pay for rewilding schemes, while the government could also issue green bonds to raise funds to lend to landowners, helping cover the early costs of restoring land to wild habitat. Reducing the demand for farm produce from land will also be key to making space for nature. This means cutting down on the most inefficient use of land – farming for meat and dairy, which uses between four and 100 times the land area to produce a single gram of protein compared to beans, nuts and other plant sources. Policies which make it easier for everyone to eat food that’s healthy and sustainable – including less meat and dairy – are the final pieces of the puzzle.  Less climate change, more wildlife, and a longer life lived closer to nature. That’s a lot to gain from modest investments in how land is used in the UK.

Every now and then the sheep mask slips just low enough on the wolf’s face for us to catch a glimpse of where things are going to end up long term.



Case in point: The Guardians of the Bays, in [this _Stuff_ article](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/402008/wellington-council-should-rein-in-airport-expansion-environmental-group-says), described as “a group initially set up to fight against the runway extension” at Wellington Airport.



When confronted about the need for greater future capacity at the airport and trying to address the resultant future carbon emissions as well as rubbishing the efficacy of future technologies, a representative had this to say:



 _“More emphasis needed to be placed on **altering people’s behaviour** and making air travel **less accessible,** Mr Randerson said.” _



Let that gobsmack you for a second.



“ **Altering people’s behaviour.** “



“ **Making air travel less accessible.** “



116 years of good old fashioned capitalist aviation research and development has come down to this. Being shut down by wannabe bureaucrats over a doom and gloom prediction with a [worse reputation for prophetic accuracy](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/10/climate-emergency-fail-of-the-day-24-2/) than economics.



If this is sounding really creepy, like history is repeating itself, it’s because it is. Who were the last group of people to be placed under travel restrictions over a fearmongering power grab? 



Never mind the fact that the Mayor responded by agreeing with capacity needs but passing the buck to central government to carbon tax aviation into oblivion. Nice balanced centrist response.



Ignore the fact that by the time Wellington Council hits its carbon-neutral target year of 2050, battery technology will probably be safe, powerful and compact enough for regional airliners and long haul will probably be burning hydrogen sourced from renewables if for no other reason than to tell the oil sheikhs where to stick their pricing plans.



So next time I want to go to Hawaii I’ll have to jump on a huge solar-powered catamaran for about 10 times the fare to pay for 2 weeks of vegan meals for the trip.



They want to steal our future! How dare they!

Ben and Jerry's Tweeted that it ""will pause all paid advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the US"".
Facebook has said it is committed to ""advancing equity and racial justice"".
Earlier this week outdoor brands The North Face, Patagonia and REI joined the campaign.
Ben and Jerry's said it is standing with the campaign and ""all those calling for Facebook to take stronger action to stop its platforms from being used to divide our nation, suppress voters, foment and fan the flames of racism and violence, and undermine our democracy.""
After George Floyd's death in police custody, Ben and Jerry's chief executive Matthew McCarthy said ""business should be held accountable"" as he set out plans to increase diversity.
George Floyd died in Minneapolis in May as a white police officer held a knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The final moments were filmed on phones. Four police officers involved have been sacked and charged over his death.
Earlier this week the freelance job listing platform Upwork and the open-source software developer Mozilla also joined the campaign.
""We're taking steps to review our policies, ensure diversity and transparency when making decisions on how we apply our policies, and advance racial justice and voter engagement on our platform,"" Facebook said on Sunday.
The statement also pointed to the company's Community Standards, which include the recognition of the platform's importance as a ""place where people feel empowered to communicate, and we take seriously our role in keeping abuse off our service"".
A European Commission report this month found Facebook removed 86% of hate speech last year, up from 82.6%.
The social network, says almost all of the content which violates its policies is automatically detected by its systems and removed before it is reported.
The Stop Hate for Profit campaign was launched last week by advocacy groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the Color Of Change.
The movement has said it is a ""response to Facebook's long history of allowing racist, violent and verifiably false content to run rampant on its platform"".
Stop Hate for Profit has called on advertisers to pressure the company to adopt stricter measures against racist and hateful content on its platforms by stopping all spending on advertising with it throughout July.
Last year the social network attracted advertising revenue of almost $70bn (Â£56bn).
Facebook, and its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, have often been criticised for the handling of controversial subjects.

"Two of the world’s leading development banks have pumped billions of dollars into the global livestock sector, despite warnings that reducing meat and dairy consumption is essential for tackling the climate crisis. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) – the commercial lending arm of the World Bank – and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have provided $2.6bn (£2.1bn) for pig, poultry and beef farming, as well as dairy and meat processing, in the past 10 years.  The UK government is a major funder of both banks and its own development bank, CDC, has also invested tens of millions of pounds in the global livestock sector over the past decade, including finance for an industrial-scale beef feedlot in Ethiopia and poultry companies in Niger and Uganda. Development banks provide medium and long-term capital for the purpose of economic growth in poorer countries. The IFC and EBRD have both publicly committed to tackling man-made climate change and making investment decisions with the climate in mind. But an investigation by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the Guardian has revealed that IFC and EBRD finance – which involved direct investments, loans and other financial support – was used for industrial-scale mega-farms, abattoirs and the expansion of multinational meat and dairy corporations. In one recent case, a beef cattle feedlot in Madagascar, owned by a conglomerate of more than 20 companies, was granted funding worth $3.5m to produce beef for export to the Middle East and the domestic market. In another, Smithfield Foods, the world’s biggest pork company, received a substantial cash injection from the IFC for its activities in Romania. Scientists have repeatedly raised the alarm over the sizeable climate footprint of animal farming – it produces nearly 15% of human-made greenhouse gas emissions – and said that unless global consumption is reduced, efforts to tackle climate change will fail. “Expanding production and consumption of meat and dairy is incompatible with the goals of the Paris climate agreement,” said Prof Pete Smith, chair in plant and soil science at the University of Aberdeen and a lead author of a landmark UN report about the impact of land use and agriculture on climate change. He cited research showing that a shift to vegetarian or vegan diets, among other food sector and land-use changes, by half of the global population by 2050 is required to meet the Paris goals. “While some investments by development agencies and banks in animal agriculture to improve food security in the world’s poorest nations may be justifiable, massive investments in livestock production systems in countries that already have high levels of consumption, and in multinational meat and dairy companies, clearly is not,” he added. Animal products tend to have far higher environmental footprints – in some cases 10 to 100 times higher – than plant-based foods because of the amount of land, water, greenhouse gas-emitting fertilisers and energy needed to produce a portion of protein. The livestock sector uses more than 80% of the world’s farmland, either as pasture or as land producing animal feed, yet provides only 18% of global calories. Last week in a landmark climate report the World Bank committed to working with clients to incentivise sustainable diets and “address drivers of increased meat consumption”, and said it was considering advocating for a carbon tax on the livestock sector. The report extolled the climate benefits of plant-based meat substitutes. Jeremy Coller, head of investment firm Coller Capital and founder of responsible finance network Fairr, said that while the financial world was beginning to play its role in lowering greenhouse gases, it was “crazily disjointed and inconsistent for the IFC and EBRD to invest public funds in intensive animal agriculture, one of the world’s highest-emitting industries”. Our analysis of public records and industry data highlights how the banks have financed companies operating across eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America. Some investments were in countries where meat supply is currently low, such as Ethiopia, but others were made in places where meat consumption per capita is already high or average, such as Ukraine, China and Romania. The dairy sector was the biggest recipient of IFC and EBRD funding, with processing companies and farms receiving more than $1bn. The pig and poultry sectors each received about $500m. The IFC told the Bureau that it is intentionally catering for growing global demand for meat and dairy and that the livestock sector is a key pillar of food security and poverty reduction in many countries. It acknowledged, however, that the sector had a “large environmental and climate footprint”. The European Bank said the meat and dairy sectors represent an important staple in the diets of many people but that livestock projects represent about 1% of its total business investment. Both banks said they are working to reduce the emissions of the projects they fund. The impact of each project should be considered against global and national emission budgets, according to Prof Tim Benton, director of the Energy, Environment and Resources programme at Chatham House. But he warned that trying to reduce the carbon footprint of a pint of milk or a single chicken is pointless when demand for those products keeps increasing. “Just because the greenhouse gas efficiency of a unit of meat or dairy has improved, if everybody’s eating more of it, the total emissions that come from meat or dairy might increase.” Both development banks told the Bureau that they assess individual projects for their carbon emissions. The EBRD added that it had introduced practices to assess climate risks across its entire portfolio. Some of the companies funded by the development banks are multinational agribusinesses or their subsidiaries or affiliates. In 2010, the EBRD took a stake in the eastern European and central Asian subsidiaries of the French group Danone, one of the world’s biggest dairy companies, which generated sales of €25.3bn (£22.5bn) in 2019. The EBRD said that its investment – now ended – had been intended to expand the dairy markets and Danone’s operations in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Among projects recently approved by the IFC is a loan of $54m to the India-based poultry giant Suguna, the country’s leading chicken supplier and one of the world’s top 10 biggest poultry producers. The company serves export markets as well as Indian consumers. The IFC loan is partly designed to aid the company’s expansion into Kenya and Bangladesh, with finance earmarked for construction of feed mills and hatcheries. The fully integrated agribusiness, which claims to work with 39,000 farms across 18 Indian states, was previously caught up in controversy, after it was alleged that an antibiotic, whose use the WHO had said should be curtailed, was found being used on one of its contract farms. The company denied this. Suguna told the Guardian that as “the key player in broiler production in India [Suguna] has been immensely pushing to reduce or remove antibiotics from the production system using different ingredients promoted by research. Suguna uses only registered antibiotics for the treatment and not for growth promotion.” Suguna is not the only India-based poultry company to have been supported by the IFC, with rival Srinivasa receiving an injection of more than $20m in 2018. Smithfield Foods – now part of the Chinese conglomerate WH Group – also benefited from IFC finance, with loans of $60m for its operations in Romania. Smithfield is the world’s largest pig producer and pork processor, and it recently hit global headlines after the Covid-19 pandemic forced it to close its flagship meatpacking plant in South Dakota, which reportedly supplies 18 million meals a day to US consumers. Research by the Coller FAIRR Index recently indicated that 77% of leading meat, fish and dairy producers, including most of the largest listed meat companies in the Ukraine and China, fell into a “high risk” category on addressing climate change, meaning that they do not adequately measure all greenhouse gas emissions and do not have meaningful targets to reduce them. The UK government has pledged to use its presidency of COP26, the annual UN climate talks, to “green local and international supply chains for foodstuffs and key commodities” and “increase the alignment of financial flows with net-zero”. The CDC told the Bureau it was about to publish a new climate change strategy to make sure agricultural companies it invested in implement “climate smart agricultural practices in order to decrease emissions and increase resilience to a warming climate... It is also important to remember that one in five people living in Africa experience hunger. Alleviating levels of chronic malnourishment and improving food security remain vital development goals.” The IFC accepted that animal protein has “a large environmental and climate footprint, yet it is important to note that its growth is demand driven and linked to people’s dairy and meat consumption preferences”. It justified the investments in the livestock industry by saying that “in most developing countries there is a significant portion of the population that struggles to meet their daily minimum requirements for nutrition, including protein”. An EBRD spokesperson said the bank is “primarily investing in increased efficiency, improvements in energy use along supply chains, improved animal welfare, waste management and utilisation (including manure management), and production of green energy”. The bank also said it actively pursued the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, “including by improving resource efficiency along the meat supply chains from farming to distribution”.

"A grand jury indicted Ronald Gasser Jr. on Thursday in the fatal  shooting of the former N. F. L. player Joe McKnight, handing down a   murder charge. The charge is more severe than the one that Mr. Gasser had initially faced in December, when critics complained that racial bias may have affected the investigation. If convicted, Mr. Gasser, 54, would face life in prison with no parole. The death of Mr. McKnight, 28, a star running back at the University of Southern California who later played for the Jets and Kansas City Chiefs in the N. F. L. spurred several days of protests. Supporters and Mr. McKnight’s former teammates were outraged after the police initially freed Mr. Gasser. Though the authorities said Mr. Gasser had admitted to the shooting on Dec. 1, he was not arrested and charged until four days later. Mr. Gasser was initially charged with manslaughter over what the authorities described as a “road rage” confrontation in Terrytown, La. about five miles southeast of New Orleans. “Subsequent to that arrest, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s Office continued working together in a collaborative effort to develop additional evidence regarding the case,” the district attorney’s office said in a statement Thursday. “Today’s indictment comes as a result of that joint effort. ” Mr. Gasser’s bond was also increased to $750, 000. The delayed arrest and lesser initial charge had angered critics, who said that Mr. Gasser, the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business, may have been afforded more leeway because he is white, or that the authorities were less invested in swift justice for a black man’s death. In a fiery response after the initial arrest, Sheriff Newell Normand of Jefferson Parish defended the pace of the investigation, saying the authorities needed time to build a better case in a state that has strong Stand Your Ground   laws. Investigators conducted more than 160 interviews and spoke to Mr. Gasser for more than 12 hours, Sheriff Normand said at a news conference in December. “Justice has no time period,” he said. “Justice is not a sprint. It is a marathon. These investigations are marathons. ” The confrontation began around 2:45 p. m. after both men were driving erratically, cutting each other off and zipping in front of each other, Sheriff Normand said. Mr. Gasser became irate and engaged in a “verbal altercation” with Mr. McKnight, the sheriff said. When they stopped next to each other at a red light, Mr. McKnight got out of his car and approached the window of Mr. Gasser’s car, the sheriff said. Mr. Gasser then pulled out a handgun from between his seat and the console and shot Mr. McKnight three times, according to the sheriff."
"Snap, the parent of Snapchat, disclosed several important aspects of its business in its initial public offering document. The complete filing is here. Below are notable excerpts. Prospective investors will be drawn to how quickly Snap has grown its advertising business in roughly two years, with the company showing a nearly sevenfold increase between 2015 and last year. The question is how long the   can maintain anywhere close to that kind of growth. The company said in its prospectus that it views daily active users as a critical measure of engagement  —   a measure that is tracked closely by similar companies. (Facebook on Wednesday reported that it had an average of 1. 23 billion daily active users in December.) As does every company in this kind of filing, Snap laid out a number of potential risks to its business. Among them is Britain’s decision to leave the European Union, what has come to be known as Brexit, which could pose large problems for the company because it recently designated London as its international hub. Snap noted that other countries may choose to censor Snapchat. Moreover, the company pointed out that many of Google’s services, which power a significant portion of Snap’s computer services, are restricted in China. So, according to Snap, it isn’t clear “if we will be able to enter the market in a manner acceptable to the Chinese government. ” The company was originally built for users to send   photographs and messages to their friends. But the company’s ambitions have grown to include user stories, news and branded content. Evan Spiegel, 26, one of Snap’s two founders, started the company while he was a student at Stanford. Mr. Spiegel, who is the company’s chief executive and serves on the board, owns a stake in the company that was worth $3. 7 billion at the end of last year. His 2016 compensation package came to $2. 6 million and included $503, 205 in base salary, a $1 million bonus and $901, 635 in other compensation that covered his $890, 339 personal security budget. The company’s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, received nearly $151 million during that same time, largely because of a $145 million stock award when he joined the company from the investment bank Credit Suisse in 2015. A month before the company first filed initial public offering documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission, its two   each sold stock worth $8. 1 million. The company more than tripled its employee ranks from 2015 to 2016. Yet even with 1, 859 staffers, the company has a relatively small number of workers relative to its valuation. Snap noted that it hired a law firm that employs Mr. Spiegel’s father. The elder Mr. Spiegel is a litigator who represented Transocean, which operated the Deepwater Horizon rig at the center of the BP oil disaster. The company has attracted a number of prominent backers, who are expected to reap handsome rewards  —   if only on paper  —   in the initial public offering. Among them are investment firms like Benchmark Capital, which owns about 13 percent of the company. Snap’s offering is being led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley won the desired “lead left” position on the prospectus, which indicates that it is the bank that will play the biggest role in the offering. The bank also led Facebook’s initial public offering."
"Since the Paris agreement was signed, Australia’s big four banks have financed new fossil fuel projects that would cancel out the national emissions reduction target 21 times over, according to analysis by the activist investor group Market Forces. The analysis, released on Wednesday, shows the banks have loaned $7bn to 33 new or expansionary fossil fuel projects between 2016 and 2019.  Market Forces is concerned that, despite each bank making public their climate commitments and investment policies, the sector still loans almost three times as much to finance fossil fuel projects compared with renewables. The coronavirus recovery is looming as a critical point where financing and policy decisions could redefine the energy market. The economic taskforce advising the Morrison government has made recommendations calling on taxpayers to underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry. At the same time, the global gas market is in crisis, Reserve Bank data has fuelled calls for a post-pandemic renewables push, and the big banks combined have suggested stimulus measures consistent with the Paris targets. “Yet the [banks] seem singularly unable to get their own houses in order,” the Market Forces research director, Jack Bertolus, said. “No amount of sustainability bluster can mask lending $7bn to new or expanded fossil fuel projects that are entirely inconsistent with limiting global warming to 1.5C. “Australia’s banks committed to support the Paris climate agreement in 2015. Half a decade later they are wrecking its chances of success by continuing … to funnel billions into new polluting projects and companies dragging us in the wrong direction.” Wednesday’s report listed 33 projects financed by the major banks since 2016, including the proposed third stage of the New Acland coalmine in Queensland (ANZ and NAB) and the Pluto 2 LNG train (ANZ and Westpac) which is part of Woodside’s massive Burrup Hub expansion off the Western Australia coast. The projects combined could enable the release of 9bn tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is 21 times the federal government’s planned emissions reduction to 2030. The Guardian last month reported activist shareholders had written to the Commonwealth Bank querying several recent loans to the gas sector, which appeared inconsistent with the bank’s policies that demand it supports only projects consistent with Paris. The bank’s response was that it considered gas a “transition fuel” that could supplant coal-fired generation. Such claims are increasingly questioned by experts. “The latest science paints a very clear picture: 1.5C means the world cannot accommodate any new or expanded fossil fuel projects,” the Market Forces report states. “Our banks must stop financing these activities if their own commitments to support the Paris agreement are to be taken seriously.” Of the big four, the Commonwealth Bank had the highest total loans to the fossil fuel sector ($12bn) and had loaned the most to expansionary fossil fuel projects ($2.8bn) since 2016. ANZ had made $2.2bn in loans to expansionary projects; NAB about $1.2bn; and Westpac about $840m. The NAB group executive for corporate and institutional banking, David Gall, told Guardian Australia that NAB was the only bank to sign up to the United Nations’ collective commitment on climate action and it was constantly reviewing its targets. “We have an important role to play in supporting our customers and their communities in the orderly transition to a low carbon economy,” Gall said. He said 69% of NAB’s lending to the power generation sector went to renewable energy sources including hydropower, wind and solar. “Since 2003, NAB has committed $10bn across 132 renewable energy projects,” Gall said. An ANZ spokeswoman said the bank’s thermal coal exposure had halved since the Paris agreement was signed. “While seeking continued reductions in line with our recent trajectory, the nature of these businesses means an orderly transition may not always be a straight line,” the spokeswoman said. “We have been working closely with a number of our customers in recent years to assist them with their plans to transition to a low carbon economy.”"

Two-Part Special Issue of Ergonomics in Design Highlights Climate Change
Tuesday, April 29, 2014
Human factors/ergonomics (HF/E) experts, like professionals in many other scientific domains, have joined the fight against global warming and climate change. Their research and practice focus on finding ways to combat or minimize its serious effects.
A special two-part issue of Ergonomics in Design examines how HF/E professionals can continue working to mitigate this worldwide phenomenon.

Part 1 of the special issue, guest edited by Ken Nemire, is now available online and may be found at http://erg.sagepub.com/.
“With recent research indicating we stay close to a maximum global warming of 1°C (now at 0.8°C) to prevent the most disastrous consequences of global warming, the articles in this special issue point the way to immediate changes to research, standards, and regulations that may involve HF/E practitioners,” said Nemire.
The following is a sampling of articles from researchers in Canada, South Africa, and the United States that are included in Part 1 of the special issue:
•    “Green Ergonomics and Green Buildings”
•    “Feedback Design Heuristics for Energy Conservation: New Opportunities for the Human Factors Practitioner”
•    “A Transdisciplinary Perspective on Hedonomic Sustainability”
•    “Bicycle Promotion as a Response to Climate Change”
“Substantially more research and effort is needed to redesign our behavior, our products, and our cities to prevent the most disastrous consequences of global warming,” said Nemire. “It is clear that much more effort at corporate and governmental levels, such as stricter regulations and standards as well as greater funding for research and development of new technologies, is needed now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”

Let’s start with some counterfactual history. 



You may find it a waste of time, I think, however, it’s relevant to ask how broad and robust the protection of free speech would be in the US if it hadn’t been for civil rights organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, and later Jewish organizations and the NAACP? 



Would a First Amendment doctrine based on viewpoint neutrality and the emergency principle have developed in the US? Or would the country have seen a development similar to Europe where hate speech – however it is defined — is criminalized and evil words to a far higher degree are seen as evil actions and therefore, cannot count on constitutional protection? 



Without holding Samuel Walker, professor emeritus of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska, responsible for my interpretation, I think it’s fair to conclude after having read his prolific and still extremely topical book Hate Speech: The History of an American Controversy (1994) that the American courts’ libertarian interpretation of the First Amendment and the widespread support for an uninhibited, robust and wide‐​open public space in the US would not have materialized without advocacy groups committed to free speech. 



At a time when the support for free speech is sliding and people on the left and on the right are more than willing to shut down their opponents it’s worth revisiting professor Walker’s story of why hate speech is protected in the US and why the current First Amendment doctrine has played a crucial and positive role in creating the necessary environment for tolerance and inclusion of groups that for decades if not centuries were not seen as belonging to American society. There was nothing inevitable about this development. American law and policy could have gone in a very different direction. 



A banal though fundamental point is that good ideas do not defeat bad ideas in and by themselves. They only prevail if there are groups and individuals willing to explain and defend them. That’s basically the reason why the US free speech tradition is different from the European one in spite of the commitment to democracy on both sides of the Atlantic. Ideas have no force in the world without advocates. In twentieth‐​century Europe there were no civil rights organizations with a position similar to the ACLU’s on free speech. 



It’s a common fallacy to think that the US from the very beginning was exceptional when it comes to the protection of free speech; that the First Amendment from the foundation of the republic meant that Americans enjoyed more or less the same legal right to freedom of expression as they do today. 



As a matter of fact, for the first 150 years the US wasn’t that different from the rest of the world. A few years after the adoption of the Bill of Rights (1791) Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts that among other things criminalized making false statements that were critical of the government. President Adams used the law to imprison his political adversaries. In general, the US federal and local governments introduced the same arguments and the same kind of legal instruments as other states around the world to silence challenges to the status quo, i.e. national security, blasphemy, obscenity, offensiveness, protection of the public order and morals and safeguarding the social peace. 



As late as 1928, a man was convicted for blasphemy in Little Rock, Arkansas. He put up a poster in a shop window with the words: ”Evolution is true”, ”the Bible is a lie”, ”God is a ghost”. During World War I Socialists received long prison terms for protesting the draft. Attacks from the right on the ACLU in the 1920s denounced free speech as ”un‐​American” because of the organization’s defense of unions and left‐​wing groups. In fact, anything that might have the tendency to cause social harm could be restricted including criticism of the government during times of war, discussion of birth control, and any literature with a sexual content. Government officials were allowed to ban speakers and groups they did not like. They issued injunctions against picket lines, Communists, Socialists, union meetings, and shut down debates about strikes and unions. 



The reality of American history is that meaningful protection of free speech and other individual rights has emerged only since the 1940s. The legal climate only began to change in 1931 when the Supreme Court upheld First Amendment rights of a Communist and of the publisher of an anti‐​Semitic newspaper – the first cases when speech deemed dangerous and offensive by the majority received constitutional protection and a vindication of the ACLU’s line. Until the 1960s free speech was considered a radical and dangerous idea. As Walker puts it: ”What millions of Americans think of as ancients and hallowed rights are of very recent origin.” 



The hate speech issue first arose in the 1920s with political and legal debates over whether to restrict offensive racial and religious speech. The same two arguments for restricting speech were repeated over and over again: First, that a particular group like the KKK or the Nazis represent a special case and a limited exception to free speech protection should be made for it, and second, that a free and democratic society has an obligation to restrict the activities of anti‐​democratic groups. In most European countries these arguments carried the day. Laws restricting hate speech and anti‐​democratic groups were adopted. 



The ACLU refuted both arguments, and their line of defense for hate speech as free speech was adopted by the courts and today serves as the foundation of American public policy and the First Amendment doctrine. The Supreme Court’s decisions were shaped by the advocacy groups that brought cases before it. The ACLU filed briefs in all the major cases through which the Supreme Court created the body of the current First Amendment law. 



The ACLU’s arguments against hate speech provisions were summed up in the 1934 statement Shall We Defend the Nazis in America? It began by challenging the argument that the Nazis with a reference to the suppression of civil liberties in Germany after Hitler’s power grab in 1933 represented a special case and should be exempted from First Amendment protection. The ACLU insisted that the rights of everybody have to be protected and defended independent of the content of their beliefs. Once you accept exemptions to free speech you cannot be sure when they will be used against yourself. In fact, the public order act that was adopted in the UK in 1936 to target Fascists was used to imprison more anti‐​Fascists than Fascists. Therefore, according to the ACLU, the right of Communists and Socialists are inextricably bound up with the rights of Nazis. 



This is in essence of viewpoint neutrality, the first principle on which the modern First Amendment doctrine is built. The other, the emergency principle, implies that speech has to entail a clear and present danger if it is to be exempted from First Amendment protection. The ACLU made the case for the clear and present danger test by making the point, that nobody can say for sure what speech will lead to violence. 



The ACLU and its allies knew from experience that one has to be very careful calling for banning offensive speech. First, if you are in the business of fighting for social change then most defenders of the status quo will perceive your speech as offensive. Second, terms like offensive speech are very elastic and can easily be used to target yourself the moment your opponents will have the power to move against you. 



Finally, it’s worth pointing out that the libertarian idea of individual rights has been driving the modern First Amendment doctrine. The ACLU early on came to the conclusion that the advancement of the rights of a minority or any other group were best achieved through the expansion of individual rights. That’s the reason why civil rights groups in the US abandoned group libel litigation to defend minorities against racism. They saw it as a threat to their larger goal of achieving equal rights. 



This libertarian idea lies at the heart of the conceptual difference on free speech between the US and Europe. The same can be said of the concept of tolerance. In America, tolerance is of the individual rather than the group, and it is more radical than what is practiced in the European nation states. In the immigrant American society, as Michael Walzer notes, the state is not committed to one group over another; it’s neutral. Government is not an arbiter of taste, and citizens must learn to tolerate one another as individuals, even within the group. This concept of tolerance is the consequence of the First Amendment doctrine’s focus on individual rights. 



Professor Walker concludes that “protection of free speech has helped to ensure the participation of different groups in American society, particularly the powerless.” He insists that free speech has promoted inclusion in contemporary society. Today, this point of view is not shared by those on college campuses who argue that hate speech must be prohibited in order to achieve the inclusion of the historical victims of discrimination. But the history of the hate speech issue, as presented in Walker’s book, supports just the opposite argument. “The inclusion of the powerless and the historical victims of discrimination has been aided (not fully achieved, of course) by the broadest content‐​neutral protection of offensive speech.”

" Banks, investors and pension funds have poured billions into the world’s largest meat and dairy companies over the past five years, a new report has found. It compares the environmental impact of “‘big ag” to that of big oil. The report, published on Thursday, said private financial backing for the world’s 35 largest meat and dairy companies totalled an estimated $478bn (£380bn) between January 2015 and 30 April this year.The financing came in the form of loans, bonds and share ownership from the likes of BNP Paribas, Barclays, HSBC, Prudential UK, Standard Life Aberdeen, Legal & General and UK pension funds, including the Universities Superannuation Scheme and the Railways Pension Scheme.Scientists have repeatedly expressed alarm over the environmental impact of large-scale food and dairy production and are calling for a transformation of the global food system. They say the current model is responsible for up to 30% of greenhouse gas emissions and 70% of freshwater use, with huge reductions in meat-eating essential to avoid climate crisis.  The report by the UK-based campaign group Feedback describes meat and dairy production as a “fundamentally extractive business model” propped up by “vast flows of private finance”. It adds: “There is no version of industrial animal agriculture that is compatible with climate justice and a zero-carbon future.”Feedback’s executive director, Carina Millstone, said the environmental and biodiversity damage from intensive meat and dairy production was “as bad if not worse” as that of major oil and gas companies.Dr Tara Garnett, an Oxford University food systems analyst, said “a sole focus on individual consumption practices” was totally inadequate. She called the funding and production of intensive animal protein to provide cheap food “a systemic problem created and maintained by powerful financial interests and by absent, unhelpful and damaging governance”. Feedback’s report found that over the past five years HSBC had loaned Brazilian meat companies Marfrig and Minerva more than “$1.8bn and as of April 2020 held shares to the tune of $9m in JBS”. JBS, Marfrig and Minerva have been linked to cattle practices that lead to Amazon deforestation.An HSBC spokesperson said the bank took its “agricultural commodities policy very seriously” and regularly assessed clients “for commitment to sustainable business practices”. Its agriculture  products  policy “sets our minimum standards related to the impact on forests from palm oil, soy, rubberwood and cattle farming”.BNP Paribas, the report points out, has a net-zero deforestation commitment yet Feedback found it was the largest lender to the top 35 animal protein companies. A BNP Paribas spokesperson said it was difficult to comment without seeing all the data but the bank “regularly strengthens its policies linked to at-risk sectors, ie in the sectors of palm oil, wood pulp and agriculture, to meet the bank’s commitment to zero net deforestation”.Barclays, said the report, was a “prolific funder of US agribusiness”, providing an estimated $5bn since 2015 in loans and underwriting to companies such as meat producers Tyson Foods and Cargill.A Barclays spokesperson said it was a “longstanding supporter of the agriculture sector”, that it used its “expertise to support the diversification of the sector”, and that it had made “a firm commitment to align our entire financing portfolio to the goals of the Paris agreement”.Many financiers argue that it is better to be involved and influential. Asked about its Marfrig investment, a Standard Life Aberdeen spokesperson said that in the past 12 months it had “spoken with Marfrig management twice, specifically on sustainability issues”.A Prudential UK spokesperson said that it was actively engaging with Amazon fire and deforestation issues and sent a document explaining specific strategies with Marfrig and Minerva Foods. Separately, Minerva Foods said in a statement that despite the challenges of indirect cattle supply chains, it has been part of the Indirect Suppliers Working Group since 2015 and acting to improve risk management. JBS has said it takes a zero-tolerance approach to deforestation in its supply chain. Pension funds were also singled out for criticism in the report, with Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), often known as the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund, listed as one of the largest shareholders in meat and dairy corporations.Line Aaltvedt, spokesperson for Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the GPFG fund, said it had regular dialogues with Brazilian soya and meat companies and with banks in Latin America and south-east Asia about lending policies to any companies that contributed to deforestation.At a UK level, the report found that the Universities Superannuation Scheme and the Railways Pension Scheme invest in Hormel, which produces Spam. A spokesperson confirmed by email that RPMI Railpen, the railway pension scheme’s asset manager, had an interest in Hormel Foods. The email said that as a “responsible asset owner” it believed “companies with robust corporate governance structures” were more likely to perform better financially over the long term.Railpen, it added, was part of a global investor engagement run by investor group FAIRR that encourages the world’s largest food companies to move away from an overreliance on animal proteins.  The Universities Superannuation Scheme said it was actively engaged in Hormel’s animal welfare benchmarking but admitted there was work to be done on its carbon footprinting."

Former Drug Czar Bill Bennett has co‐​authored an article in the _Weekly Standard_ , “The Legalization Juggernaut.” Bennett is upset about voter approval for the marijuana legalization initiatives in Colorado and Washington and recent polls showing “for the first time that a clear majority of Americans (58 percent) support marijuana legalization.” Bennett can hardly believe that we have reached this “dangerous and absurd moment.” It is absurd because, to Bennett, the policy question boils down to this: “Do we need a dumber country?” If the debate can be framed that way, Bennett and his co‐​author, Christopher Beach, are convinced that “this headlong rush into disaster can be stopped.” If.   
  
  
Some readers of Cato@Liberty might need reminding that when Bennett was a high‐​ranking government official, he once said executing drug dealers was morally justifiable. Given that stance, it must bewilder him to see marijuana stores opening in Denver, Seattle, and other cities. For the moment, all Bennett wants are a few political leaders to “speak out on marijuana.” Hmm. That’s another telling indication of the changing political climate with respect to drug policy.

Explanation #10 for the pause …”coincidence” has just completed the top 10 list, thanks Gavin! Party on! Excellent!


There is a new paper by Gavin Schmidt et al that comes in as #10 in the growing list of explanations for ‘the pause’. Now that we have a top ten list, let’s review:


New study claims low solar activity caused “the pause” in global temperature – but AGW will return! 
THE OCEANS ATE OUR GLOBAL WARMING! Trenberth and Fasullo, 2013. But the heat will come back when you least expect it.
Chinese coal caused the ‘pause’, published in the proceedings of the National Academy of Science. The study blamed Chinese coal use for the lack of global warming. Global warming proponents essentially claimed that coal use is saving us from dangerous global warming. Kaufmann et al 2011.
The Montreal Protocol caused the ‘pause‘, which reduced CFC’s – but warming will return soon. Estrada 2013.
Cowtan and Way’s (2013) underrepresented Arctic stations get adjustment to fiddle the numbers so that ‘pause’ never existed, but not so fast. It seems all isn’t quite as it seems. Dr. Judith Curry doesn’t think much of it either.
Volcanic aerosols, not pollutants, tamped down recent Earth warming, says CU study – Neely et al March 2013: A team led by the University of Colorado Boulder looking for clues about why Earth did not warm as much as scientists expected between 2000 and 2010 now thinks the culprits are hiding in plain sight — dozens of volcanoes spewing sulfur dioxide.
Contributions of Stratospheric Water Vapor to Decadal Changes in the Rate of Global Warming. Solomon et al, 2010 Science Magazine.: Stratospheric water vapor concentrations decreased by about 10% after the year 2000. Here we show that this acted to slow the rate of increase in global surface temperature over 2000–2009 by about 25% compared to that which would have occurred due only to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.’
Slower Pacific Trade winds caused the pause England Et al 2014. A paper published today in Nature Climate Change adds the eighth excuse for the ‘pause’ in global warming: strengthened Pacific trade winds, which according to the authors, were “not captured [simulated] by climate models.” On the basis of those same highly-flawed climate models, the authors predict rapid global warming will resume in a decade or so when those trade winds abate. But in 2006, we were told the opposite.
Stadium Waves. Wyatt and Curry 2013. ‘Stadium waves’ could explain lull in global warming. Not un-plausible.
“Coincidence, conspired to dampen warming trends” Schmidt et al 2014. NASA’s Gavin Schmidt et al says: ‘Here we argue that a combination of factors, by coincidence, conspired to dampen warming trends in the real world after about 1992. CMIP5 model simulations were based on historical estimates of external influences on the climate only to 2000 or 2005, and used scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, or RCPs) thereafter.’

More on #10, from Andrew Montford, who writes in The mind-boggling coincidence hypothesis:
============================================================
Schmidt and his colleagues are looking at the hiatus in surface temperature rises and considers why the CMIP5 ensemble all got it so wrong. In their new paper they explain that the reason for this is not – as wild-eyed readers at BH might think – that the models are wonky. In fact it’s all down to an incredible, incredible coincidence
Here we argue that a combination of factors, by coincidence, conspired to dampen warming trends in the real world after about 1992. CMIP5 model simulations were based on historical estimates of external influences on the climate only to 2000 or 2005, and used scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways, or RCPs) thereafter4. Any recent improvements in these estimates or updates to the present day were not taken into account in these simulations. Specifically, the influence of volcanic eruptions, aerosols in the atmosphere and solar activity all took unexpected turns over the 2000s. The climate model simulations, effectively, were run with the assumption that conditions were broadly going to continue along established trajectories.
Apparently, if you go back and rework all the forcings, taking into account new data estimates (add half a bottle of post-hoc figures) and ‘reanalyses’ of old data (add a tablespoon of computer simulation) you can bridge the gap and explain away the pause.
We conclude that use of the latest information on external influences on the climate system and adjusting for internal variability associated with ENSO can almost completely reconcile the trends in global mean surface temperature in CMIP5 models and observations. Nevertheless, attributing climate trends over relatively short periods, such as 10 to 15 years, will always be problematic, and it is inherently unsatisfying to find model–data agreement only with the benefit of hindsight.
So, with the benefit of hindsight, the climate modellers can fit their square peg into a round hole. It wasn’t that the models were running too hot, it was just that nature has got it in for climate modellers.
============================================================

This morning I was on the steps of the Supreme Court, as I have been each of the decision days starting last Monday. It's a real spectacle, with protestors and counter-protestors, interns running from the Court's press office to give their media principals slip opinions, and phalanxes of TV cameras, bright lights, screens, and assorted technical accoutrements. For someone whose job includes digesting and commenting on legal opinions, this last week of the high court's term is pretty much the Super Bowl.   
  
Except today didn't feel that way. After Obamacare on Thursday and same-sex marriage on Friday, today was the most anticlimactic ""last day of school"" since I've begun doing this.   
  
That's not to say that the three cases decided today were unimportant, either legally or politically. Indeed, until the Court took up _King v. Burwell_ and _Obergefell v. Hodges_ , each of them would've been considered among the ""big ones"" for what was, to that point, a low-key term. After all, we're talking about the death penalty, redistricting, and major environmental regulations. (And also the Court announced that it will again take up _Fisher v. UT-Austin_ , the racial-preferences case that is set to become one of next term's blockbusters.)   
  
Let's take the cases in the order they came:   






In short, even if the last day of term was overshadowed by its penultimate days, it still produced high drama: each of the three rulings split on 5-4 lines with Justice Kennedy as the swing vote, and each produced memorable concurrences/dissents, particularly by Justice Scalia.   
  
That also means that Chief Justice Roberts, as he did on marriage and disparate-impact in housing -- the ""undercard"" to _King_ on Thursday -- returned to the conservative fold. (Those who think that John Roberts is ""liberal"" or has ""evolved"" while on the bench, like Justice David Souter and other Republican appointees, are simply wrong.)   
  
Finally, the ruling in the EPA case clinched a winning record for Cato in briefs we filed in merits cases this term. We went 8-7, which is down from the previous two years but still a heckuva lot better than the government, which went 8-13. In other words, even if the term will be remembered for _King v. Burwell_ \-- and _Obergefell_ , where the government wasn't a party -- it wasn't a bad year for liberty.   
  
**Update** : This post was corrected after I recalculated the solicitor general’s won-loss record. I apparently had given the government slightly more credit than it deserved. Apologies.

John McCain has left us and left behind the record of a courageous life. But his passing, an obvious tragedy for his family, has been hijacked by Washington’s elite, who have used it to attack President Donald Trump. While many of their criticisms have been warranted, the result has been to paint McCain as a veritable secular saint, which he was not.



The great tragedy of McCain’s life was his advocacy of war and military intervention at almost every turn. He backed the Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya wars. He urged military strikes on North Korea and Iran. He visited Syrian insurgents to push U.S. intervention. He supported the Saudis’ brutal war against Yemen. He urged military action against Nigeria and Sudan. He pushed Washington to confront Russia over Georgia and lamented the lack of military options in Ukraine.



Thankfully he never reached the presidency. Lauded for his foreign policy expertise, his real talent was limited to proclaiming “bomb them” at strategic political moments. For McCain there was little difference between Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Iraq. He didn’t “do nuance.” War was a first resort, the obvious answer to most any international problem, whatever the specifics. If only Washington would impose its will abroad, Pax America would emerge, despots would flee, democrats would triumph, prosperity would bloom, Kumbaya would be sung, and the lion would lie down with the lamb.





In short, the subtraction of John McCain’s voice from Washington’s incessant warmongering Greek Chorus will reduce pressure on the president to bomb, invade, and occupy more countries.



Alas, the transition to peace in our time proved to be messy. Thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of foreigners died in John McCain’s wars. Millions of people were displaced. Corrupt and ruthless rulers prospered. Religious minorities were slaughtered and expelled. Enemy states were empowered. Jihadists seized control of cities. Terrorists flourished. Civilians were targeted. America came to realize John Quincy Adams’ admonition, attempting to “become the dictatress of the world” and in so doing finding itself no longer “the ruler of her own spirit.”



Of course, McCain was not alone responsible for America’s permanent state of war. The bipartisan War Party dominates Washington, and, at least until the advent of Donald Trump, it had controlled U.S. policy irrespective of administration. Presidents might disagree on details and be more or less enthused about loosing the dogs of war, but in a crunch they inevitably unleash the military. No past failures have deterred them from future attempts.



Still, McCain may have been the single most influential of the Senate’s unofficial horsemen of the apocalypse. His personal story, including years of captivity in Vietnam, gave him unique credibility. So did his mythical independence and reputation as a “maverick” (based on a couple well‐​publicized divergences from Republican orthodoxy), his strategic suborning of the Washington press corps, and his indefatigable determination that the U.S. should never be at peace so long as it had a plane, ship, or soldier available for combat. Through Democratic and Republican administrations, he campaigned for war.



The good news is that there is no one to replace him. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham lacks McCain’s experience and gravitas. Unlike McCain, Graham cannot say that he knew war; rather, he knew a guy who knew war. He was McCain’s faithful sidekick but only that. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas is no less irresponsible than McCain, but never became the constant media presence. When Cotton speaks, Washington thankfully does not listen.



Senator Jim Inhofe is likely to take over the Senate Armed Services Committee chairmanship. He is traditionally conservative and hawkish, and believes the budget of the Pentagon should be without limit. But he is two years older than was McCain and is better known for his skepticism of climate change than as an advocate for promiscuous war‐​making.



Senator Bob Menendez has gained a reputation as a reliable but not particularly articulate hawk. Notably, he is a Democrat, as was the now‐​retired Joe Lieberman, a reliable McCain ally. However, Menendez has been bedeviled by charges of impropriety and might not survive the November election.



Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has held Republicans together for many dubious militaristic causes, perhaps none worse than having the armed services continue to act as a bodyguard for the Saudi royals, aiding them in their dirty work against helpless, impoverished Yemen. However, legislating for war is not the same as being a celebrated spokesman for a series of mini‐​Armageddons.



The House has yielded no similarly celebrated advocates of war here, there, and everywhere. Members face the voters more often and have trouble collecting similar press attention. Moreover, with congressmen under far more pressure to satisfy constituents, another international crusade in which average folks find their loved ones coming home in boxes is not likely to be a big vote winner.



In short, the subtraction of John McCain’s voice from Washington’s incessant warmongering Greek Chorus will reduce pressure on the president to bomb, invade, and occupy more countries. How much difference that will make in practice is hard to assess. After all, the president’s own mercurial, unprincipled approach so far has yielded persistent support for ongoing wars without initiating any new ones. Moreover, Trump has within his administration uber‐​hawks as bad as McCain, most notably National Security Advisor John Bolton.



Still, McCain’s death creates an opportunity for new and improved Republican Party foreign policy spokesmen to emerge. Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee and Congressman Justin Amash have been advocating an approach more consistent with the GOP’s purported commitment to limited government and individual liberties. Others who might have been intimidated by McCain’s angry personality may feel freer to express skepticism of Washington’s conventional wisdom.



The pressure to find peaceful alternatives will only increase as Uncle Sam’s bankruptcy grows more imminent. Demonstrating that Republicans care no more about fiscal responsibility than Democrats, the current administration and Congress have simultaneously hiked outlays and reduced revenues, pushing this year’s deficit towards $1 trillion. Absent responsible fiscal reform, red ink will continue to accumulate at a prodigious pace. And fiscal pressures will grow even worse as Social Security and Medicare spending explodes to meet the aging population.



The 81‐​year‐​old McCain had few financial worries, but many others of his generation do. And they are not likely to accept cuts to their benefits to finance defense subsidies for rich allies or underwrite military expeditions to remake failed societies. However enthusiastic wannabe generals such as Lindsey Graham might be, the appeal of further Middle Eastern adventures has fallen over the years.



As pressure to cut spending rises, so will reluctance to provide foot soldiers for a new American empire. Those of military age have shown less enthusiasm for the unending neoconservative crusades initiated by their elders. Even now it is increasingly difficult to find qualified young people willing to serve in the armed forces. Proposals to sort out foreign civil wars will become ever less popular. Peace, rather than socialism, might become the signature issue for the young.



The end of the Cold War provided America with an opportunity to become a normal country again, in which the security and prosperity of its own people became the priority of its government. Instead, following 9/11, neoconservatives and other hawks hijacked U.S. foreign policy. Their control now looks less certain with the death of John McCain. It’s time for all good Republicans to come to the aid of their party, and, more importantly, their country, by rediscovering what George W. Bush briefly described as a more “humble” foreign policy.

"Climate breakdown threatens the lives of us all. Scientific research has suggested that we are in the process of a “mass extinction” event that could lead to “biological annihilation” on a large scale. Records indicate that population decay and the rapid extinction of a large number of vertebrates in recent years amount to “a massive anthropogenic erosion of biodiversity and of the ecosystem services essential to civilisation”.  Studies find that 97% of published climate scientists agree that climate change is driven by human activity. If the scientific predictions are correct, much of human society is in grave danger though our own actions. So, why isn’t climate change the biggest news story in the world? The parable of the boiling frog tells us that if a frog is placed in boiling water it will leap to safety. However, if the frog is placed in tepid water which is heated slowly, it will not sense the danger until it is too late.  When it comes to climate breakdown journalists play the role of the frog. If we take a literal understanding of the word news as the plural of new – that is, news = things that are new – then the ongoing gradual (in newsroom terms) breakdown of the climate does not meet the criteria. The effects of climate disruption, such as increased occurrences of extreme weather events or individual species extinctions have news value, the wider issue does not. Nevertheless, this issue cannot be explained in these terms alone. The most recent study into news values suggests that “bad news” and “magnitude” are two of the key elements in stories that become news. The extinction of much of the life on earth certainly meets both of these criteria. But when it comes to climate breakdown, these important news values can clash with the values of what the same study describes as the “newspaper agenda” and “the power elite”. This means that power structures within the mass media prevent climate change being covered as a topic of great importance. One of the most common claims about the role of journalists is that they “speak truth to power” or give “a voice to the voiceless”. But most academic research into the role of the mass media in wider society runs counter to these romantic notions of journalism’s role as a “fourth estate”. Indeed, the commercial nature of most mass media organisations means that they are reliant on advertising revenue to survive. An article about how human consumption is driving increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide looks editorially problematic alongside an advert for a 3D pancake printer. Likewise, an article explaining the connection between global meat consumption and climate breakdown sits awkwardly alongside adverts for discounted beef burgers for the summer BBQ. Media research has also demonstrated that a significant amount of news can be traced to the public relations activity of powerful corporate and state actors. This can be partially explained by cuts to newsroom staff alongside the growth of the public relations industry. In their new roles as public relations advisors, many experienced former journalists with a detailed understanding of newsroom culture and news values are able to supply journalists with useful quotations, sound bites and even partly-written stories. In some cases, the news media’s overreliance on powerful sources has given undue prominence to organisations with a vested interest in playing down news about climate change. In an important piece of research about objectivity in the news, the media sociologist Gaye Tuchman looked at how journalists defend their craft by appealing to notions of “objectivity”. Tuchman described how one of the problems with journalistic objectivity is that, to avoid allegations of bias, journalists present a range of “conflicting possibilities”. This often means that journalists give space to both sides of a particular debate without making a judgement on their relative merits. To do so would make them subject to allegations of bias. In their book, Merchants of Doubt, Eric Conway and Naomi Oreskes, two historians of science, investigated why human-made climate change was presented in the news media as an unsettled debate when the scientific literature supporting it was overwhelming. They found that a group of scientific experts challenged the consensus on climate change on behalf of corporations and conservative think tanks. Some of the individuals involved in this had previously challenged scientific consensus on a range of issues including the negative health implications of tobacco smoke. Corporations engage in this creation of doubt through public relations activity because climate change requires international cooperation on environmental legislation.  By performing what Tuchman calls a “strategic ritual” of objectivity, journalists obscure the scientific consensus on climate change by reporting it as a debate. This framing makes climate breakdown seem less urgent and therefore less newsworthy.  How can we improve? The notion of objectivity needs to be reclaimed through good journalism which invests resources in providing analysis and verification. News organisations are in an important position to explain complex scientific concepts in a language that most people understand, but they need to improve their scientific literacy in order to verify the relative merit of competing claims.  Journalists with a better grasp of the science (and indeed social science) of climate change would be less reliant on press releases, reducing the impact of corporate lobbyists and the need to include their public relations activity as part of the news. However, these suggestions are optimistic considering the wider power structures that constrain how journalists operate. This article is part of The Covering Climate Now series

Even the 2015 Paris Accord warned participants not to threaten the food supply, but the great Jacinda, who sees climate change as her ‘nuclear moment’ (even though there was never a nuclear moment after 1945) knows better. Jacinda wants New Zealand to be the first nation on earth to bring agriculture into its carbon reduction programme, even though it may threaten the food supply, for both New Zealand and other parts of the world.



The saddest part of all of this is the fact that our farmers are the most productive on the planet, and can already produce milk and meat with about half of the carbon dioxide emissions than any other farmer in the world can match. Jacinda and James Shaw have never acknowledged this, of course. The big bad farmers must pay the price… even if the price is a deadly blow to our biggest industry, our food supply and our economic powerhouse.



What would Jacinda understand about that, though? Or James Shaw, for that matter. Climate change is an ideology, and if we all have to go back to the Stone Age, so be it… so long as James can still fly off to his climate conferences, that is. But he is holier than thou… and holier than anyone else.



There is an answer to the agriculture issue, and it is staring everyone in the face. Surprisingly, it has been suggested by one of the climate activist kids that are constantly in our faces – and it is not Greta. No. This suggestion comes from Mia Sutherland, a 17-year old activist from New Zealand, who believes in the climate myth but has a few sensible suggestions that could provide solutions for agriculture.



If this coalition government is serious about tackling climate change and ensuring future generations are left with a prosperous planet, GMO law reform must be considered. 



While most people who hear the term ‘genetic engineering’ think of [designer babies](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/08/designer-babies-ethical-horror-waiting-to-happen), the reality is much different. In no way should New Zealand be considering deregulating laws around genetically-modified zygotes, but it should be considering the possibility within crop development and agriculture. 



A young climate activist with a modicum of sense? I need to lie down.



New Zealand’s archaic GMO laws heavily regulate the research and release of genetically engineered organisms. Those wanting to test on and release their creations must jump through a series of hoops and fulfil requirements in order to do so. Sure, these laws are argued to protect New Zealand’s valuable biodiversity, but they could be doing more harm than good in the long term. We need to be taking ambitious steps forward if we want to preserve any of our unique environment and are serious about reducing our carbon emissions. 



In Lincoln, scientists from [AgResearch](https://www.agresearch.co.nz/) are engineering a strain of ryegrass which, when fed to cows, [has the potential to reduce methane emissions by 23 per cent.](https://www.agresearch.co.nz/news/key-step-forward-for-game-changing-grass/) The ryegrass contains a High Metabolise Energy (HME) system, which promotes the production of lipids in the leaf. Higher levels of lipids, provided they don’t biohydrogenate, result in less material for the rumen to release as methane and more sustenance for the animal so they do not have to ingest as much grass as they regularly would. This ryegrass could not only reduce methane emissions, but could also cost farmers less money due to its high feed conversion efficiency. 



A similar project was run in the Marlborough district over a decade ago. The development of specialist grasses meant that ruminants could get more water from their feed, thus reducing the issues around droughts, which happen on a regular basis in the area. It has been a great success. It is also genetic engineering, used well.



This HME ryegrass has the potential to make a substantial difference to New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions – [48 per cent of which can be traced back to the agricultural sector](https://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Climate%20Change/snapshot-nzs-greenhouse-gas-inventory-1990-2017.pdf). Additionally, modelling has also shown a reduction in nitrate leaching. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires a new way of thinking, and if we’re serious about assisting farmers in their emission reduction we need to be considering less regulation of genetic engineering. 



I am not sure that this government is serious about helping farmers to reduce their emissions. I think they prefer the ‘big stick’ approach. But this is a well thought out solution that could solve both farmers requirements to reduce emissions and save our agriculture at the same time.



Before you get too excited, the Greens will not have a bar of it. Genetic engineering is an absolute no-no to any conservationist worth his salt. You might as well suggest black magic complete with devil worship.



Farmers are reported to be [“agitated”](https://www.grassland.org.nz/publications/nzgrassland_publication_2817.pdf) by the fact that this grass – which could both reduce their negative environmental impact and increase their profit – is [“trapped in the laboratory”](https://www.grassland.org.nz/publications/nzgrassland_publication_2817.pdf). 



Trapped in a laboratory overseas, that is, as our laws around GMO prohibit the technology from being developed here.



Our prime minister has claimed that she wants to “demonstrate how [food producing] can be done sustainably” to the rest of the world. If this is a serious claim, we need to see action in the form of allowing crops with forward-thinking genetic engineering, such as AgResearch’s ryegrass, to be welcome in New Zealand. 



Well done, Mia. This is a sensible proposal from someone who believes in climate change. But don’t hold your breath. This government would rather see us back in the Stone Age. Remember, climate change is not about the climate. It is about control.

"I’m writing this during a break at an academic conference on Literature and the Environment. We’re gathering as researchers in the environmental humanities to trade ideas, hear about new research, and to stock up on reading list material to share with our students in the coming year. We’re interested in discussing what kind of stories succeed in informing and convincing people about the climate and ecological emergency and asking what the results of a successful story would look like. In this sense, literary critics, writers and artists are asking the same kinds of questions as the journalists working to find a “hook” to draw attention to the UN Climate Action Summit in New York or the forthcoming IPCC special report on the oceans.  Indeed, at our 2015 conference, the BBC’s environment analyst Roger Harrabin spoke to us about the pressure of journalistic formats which insist on short, sharp reports covering clearly defined stories, leaving little room for explanation of complex environmental politics or the nuances of scientific findings. In a news cycle already working at hyperspeed and weighted with “big” stories from day-to-day politics, the environment often struggles to make itself heard in its 30-second slot, even if in the long term it may prove to be the biggest story of all.  In our little corner, we eco-lit nerds are into everything, and will huddle happily all day long to listen to papers about the weather in medieval literature, the punk anthropocene, allotment poetry or who did the gardening in Milton’s Eden. But we’re only too aware – occasionally paralysingly so – of how pointless and navel-gazing it might seem to talk about stories representing climate emergency or our relationship with the environment, when the results of that relationship and that emergency are already being experienced around the world.  This prompts questions akin to the environmental journalist’s dilemmas: how to convey accurate science to non-scientists? Is it better to inspire or terrify? Is it OK to be entertained by stories of apocalypse or environmental disaster? Are our established forms and genres able to tell the stories we need to share? One thing we have learned is there’s no sense waiting for a single “hero” book that will affect hearts and minds and prompt the kind of universal political action that Greta Thunberg and the school strikers rightly demand. At our conference, Adeline Johns-Putra, who has written extensively about the emergence of “cli-fi”, suggested that the “ethical efficacy” of literature in climate debates now arises not from single works but from the increasing ubiquity of environmental themes and settings. Awareness is emerging in every genre and form, and is no longer confined to the nature writing or cli-fi shelves.  Novels still have the power to affect the way societies see themselves: Margaret Atwood’s sequel to The Handmaid’s Tale has been eagerly awaited worldwide, for instance, while Nineteen Eighty-Four remains part of the vocabulary through which we understand political tyranny. But when it comes to climate change, we haven’t always had faith in our inherited literary modes and narrative structures to encompass such a huge and unimaginable catastrophe.  Back in 2005, Robert Macfarlane talked about the “creep” of climate change, how the slow motion disaster of ecological decline didn’t lend itself to the crash-bang dynamics of the apocalyptic imagination. Nearly 15 years later that creep is closer. It has picked up pace, we feel a greater sense of urgency. We’re discovering the horrible domino effects of climate change events, where an alteration in one area of the biosphere hastens and worsens effects in another, creating feedback loops: for example, “abrupt thawing” in the Arctic will release ancient greenhouse gases, which will hasten the atmospheric changes which cause the thawing.  Where climate change might have once been to difficult to portray due to the challenge of representing a slow apocalypse, we’re entering a speedier phase, with record-breaking temperatures every summer and “abrupt” environmental disasters occurring more often. Maybe the long-form novel is now too slow to keep up. Of course literature is not the only place to offer us ways of imagining the future. No doubt some of the excitement about Atwood’s sequel is fuelled by the success of the HBO adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale. The dystopian thriller or sci-fi has become a staple of recent serial TV (Black Mirror, Extinct, 3% among many others.) Floods and extreme weather events become part of the backdrop to a range of genres, from the lyrical drama of Beasts of the Southern Wild to the schlocky horror thrills of Crawl. And beyond literature, film or television – our usual sources of story – gamers are immersed in apocalyptic landscapes and eco-dystopia in video games like BioShock, Fallout and The Last of Us.  We’re entering a phase where a sense of ecological and climate crisis haunts stories which are not consciously environmental narratives at all. The crisis must be part of the backdrop of any story set in this and future worlds and an inescapable part of our readerly mindsets when we look back at the literature of the past.

 We ecocritics will get together in another couple of years. I don’t know where our stories will be by then: I hope they’re optimistic ones. But one thing is for sure, all our narratives – whether they’re horror films, love stories, allotment poetry or children’s books – are Anthropocene stories now."

The headlines scream, “A ‘study’ shows over 11,000 scientists say there is a climate emergency.” 



**Scientists have a moral obligation** to clearly warn humanity of any catastrophic threat and to “tell it like it is.” On the basis of this obligation and the graphical indicators presented below, we declare, with more than 11,000 scientist signatories from around the world, clearly and unequivocally that planet Earth is facing a climate emergency. 



Exactly 40 years ago, scientists from 50 nations met at the First World Climate Conference (in Geneva 1979) and agreed that alarming trends for climate change made it urgently necessary to act. 



Then there are a bunch of frightening graphs of changes since 1979. The legend for one of the alarming graphs is interesting:



In panel (f), annual tree cover loss may be for any reason (e.g., wildfire, harvest within tree plantations, or conversion of forests to agricultural land). **Forest gain is not involved in the calculation of tree cover loss.**



Well – that sounds fair, unbiased and reasonable! Jones will be very miffed that they did not count the 1 billion trees he has planted.



Here are a couple of graphs showing the world falling into the abyss:



Greenland is losing 2610 gigatonnes of ice per decade. Oh dear – there are only 2,565,000 gigatonnes left. At that alarming rate it will all be gone in 982 decades.



Antarctica is fairing much better, only losing 1230 gigatonnes of ice per decade. This is excellent news and there is much more ice there anyway – 26,500,000 gigatonnes. Since it is only disappearing half as fast it should last us another 21,544 decades or so. It is also curious that there was apparently no ice loss before about 2003.



They propose the usual Malthusian solutions: Stop breeding, stop using evil fossil fuels, stop eating meat etc etc.



Mitigating and adapting to climate change means transforming the ways we govern, manage, eat, and fulfil material and energy requirements. 



I guess it all must be true as there are some impressive names with stunning credentials in the list of 11,258 signatories of ‘scientists’, to wit:

"**Lego has become the latest big name to join an advertising boycott on social-media platforms, saying ""urgent action"" is needed to end hate speech, discrimination and misinformation.**
It would pause paid advertising on all social-media platforms for at least 30 days, the Danish toy company said, and spend the money ""on other channels"".
More than 400 companies have joined the Stop Hate for Profit campaign.
It wants ""hate, bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism and violence"" dealt with.
Facebook said artificial intelligence rooted out 90% of hate speech and it was teaming up with experts and civil rights groups to develop more tools.
It has also said it will start to label potentially harmful posts.
Mars, Target, Ford, Adidas, Coca Cola, Unilever and Starbucks have all joined the boycott
And some big brands have extended it to other platforms and suggested it could go on for longer than a month.
Lego's chief marketing officer, Julia Goldin, said: ""We are committed to having a positive impact on children and the world they will inherit.
""This includes contributing to a positive, inclusive digital environment free from hate speech, discrimination and misinformation.""
Lego said it would review its advertising on all social-media platforms, adding: ""We are confident that solutions exist, but urgent action is needed.""
Much of the current controversy came from Facebook's refusal to remove a post from US President Donald Trump, which said: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" in reference to protests following the killing in police custody of an unarmed black man, George Floyd.
A similar post on Twitter had been labelled as inflammatory.
Lego had already paused the marketing of kits involving police figures and donated $4m (Â£3.2m) to combat racism, following Black Lives Matter protests.
It comes as the digital advertising industry comes under fresh scrutiny in the UK, with the Competition and Markets Authority calling on the government to introduce a tougher regime to tackle Google and Facebook's market power.
The two companies had earned 80% of the Â£14bn spent on digital advertising in 2019, it said.
A week ago, Facebook might have thought it could ignore a boycott campaign, which, at first, was joined by a handful of companies known for being willing to take a stand on ethical issues.
But in the social-media era, which Facebook has played such a big part in shaping, movements can gain traction very quickly.
And a host of major companies have now decided it is better for their brands to join in the boycott than sit on the sidelines.
According to the Wall Street Journal, a meeting between a senior Facebook executive and marketing and advertising agencies on Tuesday failed to turn the tide.
From the concern over foreign interference and fake news during the 2016 US elections to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which broke in 2018, Facebook has repeatedly appeared behind the curve, promising action only after it was driven to respond by an outcry from users or advertisers.
But while this latest crisis is causing damage to its reputation, it is still not clear how much the company's bottom line will be affected, when so much of its revenue comes from small businesses.
And many of those taking part in the boycott are also pausing their adverts on other, smaller social-media platforms.
So, ironically, anger over Facebook's content-moderation policies could end up doing more damage to rival sites with weaker finances."
"■ President Trump responded to the failed attack in Paris with his trademark understatement. Europe is not amused. ■ The “Bowling Green massacre” that Kellyanne Conway lamented never happened, but it has triggered another   battle. ■ The president’s phone manners apparently have not changed. This time he used them on Uber’s chief executive. A soldier shot and wounded a man wielding a machete near the Louvre museum in Paris, prompting French authorities to open a terrorism investigation. The president of the United States responded: It is difficult to divine Mr. Trump’s thinking at times, but safe to say “get smart” in this case most likely means accepting his policies. For their part, Europeans aren’t taking well to the new American president. President François Hollande of France, in a defense of the European Union that Mr. Trump has disparaged, said on Friday that European countries that wanted to forge bilateral ties with the United States had to “understand that there is no future with Trump if it is not defined in common. ” Then there are the Germans: When Kellyanne Conway, the White House senior adviser, cited the “Bowling Green massacre” to justify President Trump’s halt to visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries, America was left scratching its collective head. And social media lit up with delight over the “massacre” that time forgot. This has not sat well with Ms. Conway, who after all did have a small kernel of truth to back her up, though no killings happened in Bowling Green, Ky. and a “massacre” does not appear to have ever occurred anywhere. In 2013, the State Department imposed a   freeze on processing Iraqi refugees after two Qaeda members were discovered in Iraq setting roadside bombs targeting American troops. They had been admitted to the United States in 2009 and lived in Bowling Green before they returned to Iraq. The fingerprint that nailed them was on a cellphone detonator tied to a bomb that had not exploded. So “massacre”? No. In Bowling Green? No. Refugees? Well, yes, sort of. Ms. Conway now says she misspoke. But things got really hot when a Clinton jumped into the fray  —   Chelsea Clinton. Which only stoked old campaign feuds, and a reminder of the exaggerated claim from Hillary Clinton that, as first lady, she once landed in   Bosnia under fire from hostile Serbs. It never ends. President Trump has taken some heat for his phone manners since it emerged that he pretty much chewed out Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia before hanging up on him. Apparently Mr. Trump is unrepentant. According to the new online newsletter Axios, Mr. Trump had an unpleasant conversation with the chief executive of Uber, Travis Kalanick, after the brash entrepreneur quit  the president’s business council in protest of his executive order banning some foreigners from entering the country. Some in Mr. Trump’s “inner circle” suggested that Mr. Kalanick was cutting off his access to the White House. Mr. Kalanick might be a little more concerned with all the smartphone users’ dropping their Uber app in favor of Lyft, a competitor that was first to protest Mr. Trump’s immigration policies. In an unusual early morning session, the Senate on Friday cleared an important procedural hurdle to approving Betsy DeVos, Mr. Trump’s nominee for education secretary, setting up a final,   confirmation vote next week. The Senate’s    vote along party lines to limit further debate on her nomination is deceptive. Two Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, went along with the procedural vote, but they say they will oppose her on the final vote, expected on Tuesday. Callers have overwhelmed the Capitol’s phone system, many of them expressing angry opposition to Ms. DeVos’s nomination. Senators have heard from all manner of educators in their home states opposing her confirmation  —   and not just teachers’ unions. The opposition from Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski raises the prospects of a    tie that Vice President Mike Pence, as president of the Senate, would have to settle. After convening at 6:30 a. m. one of the earliest starts in recent memory, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, urged his colleagues to take stock of their positions on Ms. DeVos’s nomination over the weekend. ”Sometimes loyalty to a president demands a bit too much,” he said on the floor. Why so early? Under Senate rules, a set amount of time had to elapse between the first procedural actions, which took place Wednesday afternoon, and Friday’s vote. Remember Russia? The country that intelligence officials believe interfered in the 2016 presidential election on Mr. Trump’s behalf? Two weeks into Mr. Trump’s presidency, talk of the foreign power’s apparent role has somewhat faded from view, at least temporarily, in the daily avalanche of White House exploits and misadventures. But Capitol Hill will have its say. Two senators are convening an investigation into Russia’s election interference, joining other efforts in Congress to examine what happened. Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said their investigation would focus on Russian interference both in the United States’ election and in other elections around the world. (Mr. Graham is the chairman and Mr. Whitehouse is the ranking member of a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee that is focused on crime and terrorism.) “Our goal is simple,” the senators said in a joint statement. “To the fullest extent possible we want to shine a light on Russian activities to undermine democracy. ” There are already multiple Senate committee examinations into Russia’s role, as well as an inquiry by the House. Dr. Harold N. Bornstein has been President Trump’s personal doctor for more than 35 years. He prescribed Mr. Trump the   drug that keeps the presidential mane flowing, and declared him the healthiest man to hold the highest office in the land. But for now, Mr. Trump will keep the same White House doctor who cared for Barack Obama, Ronny Jackson, a rear admiral in the Navy. The decision, first reported by the online medical journal Stat, raised the possibility that voters might actually get some reliable information on the health of their commander in chief. The meeting of   chief executives at the White House on Friday  —   people like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone  —   was supposed to prove the bona fides of the new,     . But Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on visas from seven predominantly Muslim countries has complicated the discussion considerably. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, told employees he was dropping off Mr. Trump’s economic advisory council in protest of his immigration policies, given the number of immigrant Uber drivers. Bob Iger of Disney is not attending. And Elon Musk let it be known on Twitter that he would object to the ban to the president’s face."

A WUWT reader from NCAR sends this but wishes to remain anonymous. I verified the IP address as coming from NCAR. Bold mine.
============================================================
Hi Mr. Watts,
I come to your website nearly every day. Working here at NCAR, we rarely ever get to hear the other side of the CAGW argument, so I greatly appreciate your balanced and very informational website. I’m a young scientist and am too afraid to speak out at work, because I fear repercussions. Anyway, I thought you might be interested in reading an announcement for a seminar coming up soon here at NCAR. It came in our “Staff Notes” that everybody here at NCAR receives every day in our inbox. Some of these folks are getting really bitter that they are losing ground in this all-important argument.

Speaker: Thomas E. Downing, CEO of the Global Climate Adaptation Partnership
Date: January 7, 2014
Time: 2:00pm
Place: FL 2 Room 3107
Title: Change-making in the Adaptation Landscape
Abstract:
Action on climate adaptation, a wicked problem, requires navigating a landscape that is only partly known, using wayfinding aids that are problematic at the best of times, in company with often recalcitrant partners. Beginning with this metaphor, Tom Downing traces recent thinking and emerging prospects for climate change adaptation. He draws upon a toolkit that spans theory of change to multi-attribute metrics. Case studies from Africa and Latin America illustrate key principals of practice.

Social media are now widely criticized after enjoying a long period of public approbation. The kinds of human activities that are coordinated through social media, good as well as bad, have always existed. However, these activities were not visible or accessible to the whole of society. As conversation, socialization, and commerce are aggregated into large‐​scale, public commercial platforms, they become highly visible to the public and generate storable, searchable records. Social media make human interactions hypertransparent and displace the responsibility for societal acts from the perpetrators to the platform that makes them visible.



This hypertransparency is fostering a moral panic around social media. Internet platforms, like earlier new media technologies such as TV and radio, now stand accused of a stunning array of evils: addiction, fostering terrorism and extremism, facilitating ethnic cleansing, and even the destruction of democracy. The social‐​psychological dynamics of hypertransparency lend themselves to the conclusion that social media cause the problems they reveal and that society would be improved by regulating the intermediaries that facilitate unwanted activities.



This moral panic should give way to calmer reflection. There needs to be a clear articulation of the tremendous value of social media platforms based on their ability to match seekers and providers of information in huge quantities. We should also recognize that calls for government‐​induced content moderation will make these platforms battlegrounds for a perpetual intensifying conflict over who gets to silence whom. Finally, we need a renewed affirmation of Section 230 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which shields internet intermediaries from liability for users’ speech. Contrary to Facebook’s call for government‐​supervised content regulation, we need to keep platforms, not the state, responsible for finding the optimal balance between content moderation, freedom of expression, and economic value. The alternative of greater government regulation would absolve social media companies of market responsibility for their decisions and would probably lead them to exclude and suppress even more legal speech than they do now. It is the moral panic and proposals for regulation that threaten freedom and democracy.



In a few short years, social media platforms have gone from being shiny new paragons of the internet’s virtue to globally despised scourges. Once credited with fostering a global civil society and bringing down tyrannical governments, they are now blamed for an incredible assortment of social ills. In addition to legitimate concerns about data breaches and privacy, other ills — hate speech, addiction, mob violence, and the destruction of democracy itself — are all being laid at the doorstep of social media platforms.



Why are social media blamed for these ills? The human activities that are coordinated through social media, including negative things such as bullying, gossiping, rioting, and illicit liaisons, have always existed. In the past, these interactions were not as visible or accessible to society as a whole. As these activities are aggregated into large‐​scale, public commercial platforms, however, they become highly visible to the public and generate storable, searchable records. In other words, social media make human interactions hypertransparent.1



This new hypertransparency of social interaction has powerful effects on the dialogue about regulation of communications. It lends itself to the idea that social media causes the problems that it reveals and that society can be altered or engineered by meddling with the intermediaries who facilitate the targeted activities. Hypertransparency generates what I call the fallacy of displaced control. Society responds to aberrant behavior that is revealed through social media by demanding regulation of the intermediaries instead of identifying and punishing the individuals responsible for the bad acts. There is a tendency to go after the public manifestation of the problem on the internet, rather than punishing the undesired behavior itself. At its worst, this focus on the platform rather than the actor promotes the dangerous idea that government should regulate generic technological capabilities rather than bad behavior.



Concerns about foreign interference and behavioral advertising brought a slowly simmering social media backlash to a boil after the 2016 election. As this reaction enters its third year, it is time to step back and offer some critical perspective and an assessment of where free expression fits into this picture. As hypertransparency brings to public attention disturbing, and sometimes offensive, content, a moral panic has ensued — one that could lead to damaging regulation and government oversight of private judgment and expression. Perhaps policy changes are warranted, but the regulations being fostered by the current social climate are unlikely to serve our deepest public values.



The assault on social media constitutes a textbook case of moral panic. Moral panics are defined by sociologists as “the outbreak of moral concern over a supposed threat from an agent of corruption that is out of proportion to its actual danger or potential harm.”2 While the problems noted may be real, the claims “exaggerate the seriousness, extent, typicality and/​or inevitability of harm.” In a moral panic, sociologist Stanley Cohen says, “the untypical is made typical.”3 The exaggerations build upon themselves, amplifying the fears in a positive feedback loop. Purveyors of the panic distort factual evidence or even fabricate it to justify (over)reactions to the perceived threat. One of the most destructive aspects of moral panics is that they frequently direct outrage at a single easily identified target when the real problems have more complex roots. A sober review of the claims currently being advanced about social media finds that they tick off all these boxes.



Social media platforms are accused of generating a cacophony of opinions and information that is degrading public discourse. A quote from a respected media scholar summarizes the oft‐​repeated view that social media platforms have an intrinsically negative impact on our information environment:



An always‐​on, real‐​time information tsunami creates the perfect environment for the spread of falsehoods, conspiracy theories, rumors, and “leaks.” Unsubstantiated claims and narratives go viral while fact checking efforts struggle to keep up. Members of the public, including researchers and investigative journalists, may not have the expertise, tools, or time to verify claims. By the time they do, the falsehoods may have already embedded themselves in the collective consciousness. Meanwhile, fresh scandals or outlandish claims are continuously raining down on users, mixing fact with fiction.4



In this view, the serpent of social media has driven us out of an Eden of rationality and moderation. In response, one might ask: in human history, what public medium has _not_ mixed fact with fiction, has _not_ created new opportunities to spread falsehoods, or has _not_ created new challenges for verification of fact? Similar accusations were levelled against the printing press, the daily newspaper, radio, and television; the claim that social media are degrading public discourse exaggerates both the uniqueness and the scope of the threat.



A variant on this theme links the ad‐​driven business model of social media platforms to an inherently pathological distortion of the information environment: as one pundit wrote, “YouTube leads viewers down a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales.”5 A facile blend of pop psychology and pop economics equates social media engagement to a dopamine shot for the user and increasing ad revenue for the platform. The way to prolong and promote such engagement, we are told, is to steer the user to increasingly extreme content. Any foray into the land of YouTube videos is a one‐​way ticket to beheadings, Alex Jones, flat‐​earthism, school‐​shooting denial, Pepe the Frog, and radical vegans. No more kittens, dog tricks, or baby pictures: for some unspecified reason, those nice things are no longer what the platform delivers.



In the quote below, an academic evokes all the classical themes of media moral panics — addiction, threats to public health, and a lack of confidence in the agency of common people — into a single indictment of YouTube algorithmic recommendations:



Human beings have many natural tendencies that need to be vigilantly monitored in the context of modern life. For example, our craving for fat, salt and sugar, which served us well when food was scarce, can lead us astray in an environment in which fat, salt and sugar are all too plentiful and heavily marketed to us. So too our natural curiosity about the unknown can lead us astray on a website that leads us too much in the direction of lies, hoaxes and misinformation. In effect, YouTube has created a restaurant that serves us increasingly sugary, fatty foods, loading up our plates as soon as we are finished with the last meal.6



Another social media critic echoed similar claims:



Every pixel on every screen of every Internet app has been tuned to influence users’ behavior. Not every user can be influenced all the time, but nearly all users can be influenced some of the time. In the most extreme cases, users develop behavioral addictions that can lower their quality of life and that of family members, co‐​workers and close friends.7



If one investigates the “science” behind these claims, however, one finds little to differentiate social media addiction from earlier panics about internet addiction, television addiction, video game addiction, and the like. The evidence for the algorithmic slide toward media fat, salt, and sugar traces back to one man, Jonathan Albright of Columbia University’s Tow Center, and it is very difficult to find any published, peer‐​reviewed academic research from Albright. All one can find is a blog post on _Medium_ , describing “the network of YouTube videos users are exposed to after searching for ‘crisis actor’ following the Parkland event.”8 In other words, the blog reports the results of one search and one selected search phrase; there is no description of a methodology nor is there any systematic conceptualization or argumentation about the causal linkage between YouTube’s business model and the elevation of extreme and conspiratorial content. Yet Albright’s claims echoed through the _New York Times_ and dozens of other online media outlets.



The psychological claims also seem to suffer from a moral panic bias. According to Courtney Seiter, a psychologist cited by some of the critics, the oxytocin and dopamine levels generated by social media use generate a positive “hormonal spike equivalent to [what] some people [get] on their wedding day.” She goes on to say that “all the goodwill that comes with oxytocin — lowered stress levels, feelings of love, trust, empathy, generosity — comes with social media, too … between dopamine and oxytocin, social networking not only comes with a lot of great feelings, it’s also really hard to stop wanting more of it.”9 The methodological rigor and experimental evidence behind these claims seems to be thin, but even so, wasn’t social media supposed to be a tinderbox for hate speech? Somehow, citations of Seiter in attacks on social media seem to have left the trust, empathy, and generosity out of the picture.



The panic about elevating conspiratorial and marginalized content is especially fascinating. We are told in terms reminiscent of the censorship rationalizations of authoritarian governments that social media empowers the fringes and so threatens social stability. Yet for decades, mass media have been accused of appealing to the mainstream taste and of marginalizing anything outside of it. Indeed, in the 1970s, progressives tried to force media outlets to include marginalized voices in their channel lineup through public access channels. Nowadays, apparently, the media system is dangerous because it does precisely the opposite.



But the overstatement of this claim should be evident. Major advertisers come down hard on the social platforms very quickly when their pitches are associated with crazies, haters, and blowhards, leading to algorithmic adjustments that suppress marginal voices. Users’ ability to “report” offensive content is another important form of feedback. But this has proven to cut both ways: lots of interesting but racy or challenging content gets suppressed. Some governments have learned how to game organized content moderation to yank messages exposing their evil deeds. (See the discussion of Facebook and Myanmar in the next section.) In the ultramoderated world that many of the social media critics seem to be advocating, important minority‐​viewpoint content is as likely to be targeted as terrorist propaganda and personal harassment.



 **Murder, hate speech, and ethnic cleansing.** Another key exhibit in the case against social media pins the responsibility for ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, and similar incitement tragedies in the developing world, on Facebook. In this case, as in most of the other concerns, there is substance to the claim but its use and framing in the public discourse seems both biased and exaggerated. In Myanmar, the Facebook platform seems to have been systematically utilized as part of a state‐​sponsored campaign to target the Rohingya Muslim minority.10 The government and its allies incited hatred against them, while censoring activists and journalists documenting state violence, by reporting their work as offensive content or in violation of community standards. At the same time, the government‐​sponsored misinformation and propaganda against the Rohingya managed to avoid the scrutiny applied to the expression of human‐​rights activists. Social media critics also charged that the Facebook News Feed’s tendency to promote already popular content allowed posts inciting violence against the minority to go viral. As a result, Facebook is blamed for the tragedies in Myanmar. I have encountered people in the legal profession who would like to bring a human‐​rights lawsuit against Facebook.11 If any criticism can be leveled at Facebook’s handling of genocidal propaganda in Myanmar, it is that Facebook’s moderation process is too deferential to governments. This, however, militates against greater state regulation.



But these claims show just how displaced the moral panic is. Why is so much attention being focused on Facebook and not on the crimes of a state actor? Yes, Myanmar military officers used Facebook (and other media) as part of an anti‐​Rohingya propaganda campaign. If the Burmese generals used telephones or text messages to spread their poison, are they going to blame those service providers or technologies? How about roads, which were undoubtedly used by the military to oppress Rohingya? In fact, violent conflict between Rohingya Muslims and Myanmar’s majority population goes back to 1948, when the country achieved independence from the British and the new government denied citizenship to the Rohingya. A nationalist military coup in 1962 targeted them as a threat to the new government’s concept of national identity; the army closed Rohingya social and political organizations, expropriated Rohingya businesses, and detained dissenters. It went on to regularly kill, torture, and rape Rohingya people.



Facebook disabled the accounts of the military propagandists once it understood the consequences of their misuse, although this happened much more slowly than critics would have liked. What’s remarkable about the discussion of Facebook, however, is the way attention and responsibility for the oppression has been diverted away from a military dictatorship engaged in a state‐​sponsored campaign of ethnic cleansing, propaganda, and terror to a private foreign social media platform. In some cases, the discussion seems to imply that the absence of Facebook from Myanmar would solve, or even improve, the conflict that has been going on for 70 years. It is worth remembering that Facebook’s status as an _external_ platform not under the control of the local government was the only thing that made it possible to intervene at all. Interestingly, the _New York Times_ article that broke this story notes that pro‐​democracy officials in Myanmar say Facebook was essential for the democratic transition that brought them into office in 2015.12 This claim is as important (and as unverified and possibly untestable) as the claim that it is responsible for ethnic cleansing. But it hasn’t gotten any play lately.



 **Reviving the Russian menace.** Russia‐​sponsored social media use during the 2016 election provides yet another example of the moral panic around social media and the avalanche of bitter exaggeration that goes with it. Indeed, the 2016 election marks the undisputed turning point in public attitudes toward social media. For many Americans, the election of Donald Trump came as a shocking and unpleasant surprise. In searching for an explanation of what initially seemed inexplicable, however, the nexus between the election results, Russian influence operations, and social media has become massively inflated. It has become too convenient to overlook Trump’s complete capture of the Republican Party and his ability to capitalize on nationalistic and hateful themes that conservative Republicans had been cultivating for decades. The focus on social media continues to divert our attention from the well‐​understood negatives of Hillary Clinton as well as the documented impact of James Comey’s decision to reopen the FBI investigation of Clinton’s emails at a critical period in the presidential campaign. It overlooks, too, the strength of the Bernie Sanders challenge and the way the Clinton‐​controlled Democratic National Committee alienated his supporters. It also tends to downplay the linkages that existed between Trump’s campaign staff, advisers, and Russia that had nothing to do with social media influence.



How much more comforting it was to focus on a foreign power and its use of social media than to face up to the realities of a politically polarized America and the way politicians and their crews peddle influence to a variety of foreign states and interests.13 As this displacement of blame developed, references to Russian _information operations_ uniformly became references to Russian _interference_ in the elections.14 Interference is a strong word — it makes it seem as if leaks of real emails and a disinformation campaign of Twitter bots and Facebook accounts were the equivalent of stuffing ballot boxes, erasing votes, hacking election machines, or forcibly blocking people from the polls. As references to foreign election interference became deeply embedded in the public discourse, the threat could be further inflated to one of national security. And so suddenly, the regulation of political speech got on the agenda of Congress, and millions of liberals and progressives became born‐​again Cold Warriors, all too willing to embrace nationalistic controls on information flows.



In April 2016 hackers employed by the Russian government compromised several servers belonging to the Democratic National Committee, exfiltrated a trove of internal communications, and published them via Wikileaks using a “Guccifer 2.0” alias.15 The emails leaked by the Russians were not made up by the Russians; they were real. What if they had been leaked by a 21st‐​century Daniel Ellsberg instead of the Russians? Would that also be considered election interference? Disclosures of compromising information (e.g., Trump’s _Access_ Hollywood tape) have a long history in American politics. Is that election interference? How much of the cut‐​and‐​thrust of an open society’s media system, and how many whistleblowers, are we willing to muzzle in this moral panic?



 **The Death of Democracy.** Some critics go so far as to claim that democracy itself is threatened by the existence of open social media platforms. “[Facebook] has swallowed up the free press, become an unstoppable private spying operation and undermined democracy. Is it too late to stop it?” asks the subtitle of one typical article.16 This critique is as common as it is inchoate. In its worst and most simple‐​minded form, the mere ability of foreign governments to put messages on social media platforms is taken as proof that the entire country is being controlled by them. These messages are attributed enormous power, as if they are the only ones anyone sees; as if foreign governments don’t routinely buy newspaper ads, hire Washington lobbyists, or fund nonprofits and university programs. Worse still, those of this mindset equate messages with weapons in ceaseless “information warfare.” It is claimed that social media are being, or have been, “weaponized” — a transitive verb that was popularized after being applied to the 9/11 attackers’ use of civilian aircraft to murder thousands of people.17 Users of this term show not the slightest embarrassment at a possible overstatement implicit in the comparison.



Cybersecurity writer Thomas Rid made the astounding assertion that the most “open and liberal social media platform” (Twitter) is “a threat to open and liberal democracy” precisely because it is open and liberal, thus implying that free expression is a national security threat.18 In a _Time Magazine_ cover story, a former Facebook executive complained that Facebook has “aggravated the flaws in our democracy while leaving citizens ever less capable of thinking for themselves.”19 The nature of this threat is never scientifically documented in terms of its actual effect on voting patterns or political institutions. The only evidence offered is simple counts of the number of Russian trolls and bots and their impressions — numbers that look unimpressive compared to the spread of a single Donald Trump tweet. What we don’t often hear is that social media is the most important source of news for only 14 percent of the population. Research by two economists concluded that “… social media have become an important but not dominant source of political news and information. Television remains more important by a large margin.” They also conclude that there is no statistically significant correlation between social media use and those who draw ideologically aligned conclusions from their exposure to news.20



The most disturbing element of the “threat to democracy” argument is the way it militarizes public discourse. The view of social media as information warfare seems to go hand‐​in‐​hand with the contradictory idea that imposing more regulation by the nation‐​state will “disarm” information and parry this threat to democracy. In advancing what they think of as sophisticated claims that social media are being weaponized, the joke is on our putative cybersecurity experts: it is Russian and Chinese doctrine that the free flow of information across borders is a subversive force that challenges their national sovereignty. This doctrine, articulated in a code of conduct by the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, was designed to rationalize national blocking and filtering of internet content.21 By equating the influence that occurs via exchanges of ideas, information, and propaganda with war and violence, these pundits pose a more salient danger to democracy and free speech than any social media platform.



Any one of these accusations — the destruction of public discourse, responsibility for ethnic cleansing and hate speech, abetting a Russian national security threat, and the destruction of democracy — would be serious enough. Their combination in a regularly repeated catechism constitutes a moral panic. Moral panics should inspire caution because they produce policy reactions that overshoot the mark. A fearful public can be stampeded into legal or regulatory measures that serve a hidden agenda. Targeted actors can be scapegoated and their rights and interests discounted. Freedom‐​enhancing policies and proportionate responses to problems never emerge from moral panics.



One antidote to moral panic is historical perspective. Media studies professor Kirsten Drotner wrote, “[E]very time a new mass medium has entered the social scene, it has spurred public debates on social and cultural norms, debates that serve to reflect, negotiate and possibly revise these very norms … In some cases, debate of a new medium brings about — indeed changes into — heated, emotional reactions … what may be defined as a media panic.”22 We need to understand that we are in the midst of one of these renegotiations of the norms of public discourse and that the process has tipped over into media panic — one that demonizes social media generically.



We can all agree that literacy is a good thing. In the 17th and 18th centuries, however, some people considered literacy’s spread subversive or corrupting. The expansion of literacy from a tiny elite to the general population scared a lot of conservatives. It meant not only that more people could read the Bible, but also that they could read radical liberal tracts such as Thomas Paine’s _Rights of Man_. Those who feared wider literacy believed that it generated conflict and disruption. In fact, it already had. The disintermediation of authority over the interpretation of the written word by the printing press and by wider literacy created centrifugal forces. Protestants had split with Catholics, and later, different Protestant sects formed around different interpretations of scripture. Later, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the upper class and the religious also complained about sensationalistic printed broadsheets and printed ballads that appealed to the “baser instincts” of the public. Commercial media that responded to what the people wanted were not perceived kindly by those who thought they knew best. Yet are these observations an argument for keeping people illiterate? If not, then what, exactly, do these concerns militate for? A controlled, censored press? A press licensed in “the public interest”? Who in those days would have been made the arbiter of public interest? The Pope? Absolutist kings?



Radio broadcasting was an important revolution in mass media technology. It seems to have escaped the intense, concentrated panic we are seeing around contemporary social media, but in the United States, where broadcasting had relatively free and commercial origins, those in power felt threatened by its potential to evolve into an independent medium. Thomas Hazlett has documented the way the 1927 Federal Radio Act and the regulatory commission it created (later to become the Federal Communications Commission) nationalized the airwaves in order to keep the new medium licensed and under the thumb of Congress.23 Numerous scholarly accounts have shown how the public‐​interest licensing regime erected after the federal takeover of the airwaves led to a systematic exclusion of diverse voices, from socialists to African Americans to labor unions.24



There is another relevant parallel between radio and social media. Totalitarian dictatorships, particularly Nazi Germany, employed radio broadcasting extensively in the 1930s. Those uses, some of which sparked the birth of modern communications effects research, were much scarier than the uses of social media by today’s dictatorships and illiberal democracies. But oddly, our current panic tends to promote and support precisely the types of regulation and control favored by those very same modern dictatorships and illiberal democracies: centralized content moderation and blocking by the state and holding social media platforms responsible for the postings of their users.



Comic books generated a media panic in the 1940s and 50s.25 A critic of American commercial culture, Frederic Wertham, believed that comic books encouraged juvenile delinquency and subverted the morality of children for the sake of profit. The presence of weirdness, violence, horror, and sexually tinged images led to charges that the comics were dangerous, addictive, and catered to baser instincts. A comic‐​book scare ensued, complete with a flood of newspaper stories, Congressional hearings, and a transformation of the comic book industry. The comic‐​book scare seems to have pioneered the three themes that characterize so much public discourse around new media in the 20th century: anti‐​commercialism, protecting children, and addiction. All are echoed in the current fight over social media. The same themes sounded in policy battles over television. Television’s status as a cause of violence was debated and researched endlessly. Its pollution of public discourse, the way it “cultivated” inaccurate and harmful stereotypes, and its addictive qualities were constant sources of discussion.26 Again the similarity to current debates about social media is apparent.



In examining historical cases, it becomes apparent that it is the retailers and instigators of media panic who generally pose the biggest threat to free expression and democracy. For at their root, attacks on new media, past and present, are expressions of fear: fear of empowering diverse and dissonant voices, the elites’ fears over losing hegemony over public discourse, and a lack of confidence in the ability of ordinary people to control their “baser instincts” or make sense of competing claims. The more sophisticated variants of these critiques are rationalizations of paternalism and authoritarianism. In the social media panic, we have both conservative _and_ liberal elites recoiling from the prospect of a public sphere over which they have lost control, and both are preparing the way for regulatory mechanisms that can tame diversity, homogenize output, and maintain their established place in society.



A recent exchange on Twitter exposed the policy vacuity of those leading the social media moral panic. Kara Swisher, a well‐​known tech journalist with more than a million followers, tweeted to Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter:



Overall here is my mood and I think a lot of people when it comes to fixing what is broke about social media and tech: Why aren’t you moving faster? Why aren’t you moving faster? Why aren’t you moving faster?27



Swisher’s impatient demand for fast action seemed to assume that the solutions to social media’s ills were obvious. I tweeted in reply, asking what “fix” she wanted to implement so quickly. There was no answer.



Here is the diagnosis I would offer. What is “broken” about social media is exactly the same thing that makes it useful, attractive, and commercially successful: it is incredibly effective at facilitating discoveries and exchanges of information among interested parties at unprecedented scale. As a direct result of that, there are more informational interactions than ever before and more mutual exchanges between people. This human activity, in all its glory, gore, and squalor, generates storable, searchable records, and its users leave attributable tracks everywhere. As noted before, the emerging new world of social media is marked by hypertransparency.



From the standpoint of free expression and free markets there is nothing inherently broken about this; on the contrary, most of the critics are unhappy precisely _because_ the model is working: it is unleashing all kinds of expression and exchanges, and making tons of money at it to boot. But two distinct sociopolitical pathologies are generated by this. The first is that, by exposing all kinds of deplorable uses and users, it tends to funnel outrage at these manifestations of social deviance toward the platform providers. A man discovers pedophiles commenting on YouTube videos of children and is sputtering with rage at … YouTube.28 The second pathology is the idea that the objectionable behaviors can be engineered out of existence or that society as a whole can be engineered into a state of virtue by encouraging intermediaries to adopt stricter surveillance and regulation. Instead of trying to stop or control the objectionable behavior, we strive to control the communications intermediary that was used by the bad actor. Instead of eliminating the crime, we propose to deputize the intermediary to recognize symbols of the crime and erase them from view. It’s as though we assume that life is a screen, and if we remove unwanted things from our screens by controlling internet intermediaries, then we have solved life’s problems. (And even as we do this, we hypocritically complain about China and its alleged development of an all‐​embracing social credit system based on online interactions.)



The reaction against social media is thus based on a false premise and a false promise. The false premise is that the creators of tools that enable public interaction at scale are primarily _responsible_ for the existence of the behaviors and messages so revealed. The false promise is that by pushing the platform providers to block content, eliminate accounts, or otherwise attack manifestations of social problems on their platforms, we are solving or reducing those problems. Combing these misapprehensions, we’ve tried to curb “new” problems by hiding them from public view.



The major platforms have contributed to this pathology by taking on ever‐​more‐​extensive content‐​moderation duties. Because of the intense political pressure they are under, the dominant platforms are rapidly accepting the idea that they have overarching social responsibilities to shape user morals and shape public discourse in politically acceptable ways. Inevitably, due to the scale of social media interactions, this means increasingly automated or algorithmic forms of regulation, with all of its rigidities, stupidities, and errors. But it also means massive investments in labor‐​intensive manual forms of moderation.29



The policy debate on this topic is complicated by the fact that internet intermediaries cannot really avoid taking on some optional content regulation responsibilities beyond complying with various laws. Their status as multisided markets that match providers and seekers of information requires it.30 Recommendations based on machine learning guide users through the vast, otherwise intractable amount of material available. These filters vastly improve the value of a platform to a user, but they also indirectly shape what people see, read, and hear. They can also, as part of their attempts to attract users and enhance the platforms’ value to advertisers, discourage or suppress messages and forms of behavior that make their platforms unpleasant or harmful places. This form of content moderation is outside the scope of the First Amendment’s legal protections because it is executed by a private actor and falls within the scope of editorial discretion.



Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act squared this circle by immunizing information service providers who did nothing to restrict or censor the communications of the parties using their platforms (the classical “neutral conduit” or common‐​carrier concept), while also immunizing information service providers who assumed some editorial responsibilities (e.g., to restrict pornography and other forms of undesirable content). Intermediaries who did nothing were (supposed to be) immunized in ways that promoted freedom of expression and diversity online; intermediaries who were more active in managing user‐​generated content were immunized to enhance their ability to delete or otherwise monitor “bad” content without being classified as publishers and thus assuming responsibility for the content they did not restrict.31



It is clear that this legal balancing act, which worked so well to make the modern social media platform successful, is breaking down. Section 230 is a victim of its own success. Platforms have become big and successful in part because of their Section 230 freedoms, but as a result they are subject to political and normative pressures that confer upon them de facto responsibility for what their users read, see, and do. The threat of government intervention is either lurking in the background or being realized in certain jurisdictions. Fueled by hypertransparency, political and normative pressures are making the pure, neutral, nondiscriminatory platform a thing of the past.



The most common proposals for fixing social media platforms all seem to ask the platforms to engage in _more_ content moderation and to ferret out unacceptable forms of expression or behavior. The political demand for more‐​aggressive content moderation comes primarily from a wide variety of groups seeking to suppress specific kinds of content that is objectionable to them. Those who want less control or more toleration suffer from the diffuse costs/​concentrated benefit problem familiar to us from the economic analysis of special interest groups: that is, toleration benefits everyone a little and its presence is barely noticeable until it is lost; suppression, on the other hand, offers powerful and immediate satisfaction to a few highly motivated actors.32



At best, reformers propose to rationalize content moderation in ways designed to make its standards clearer, make their application more consistent, and make an appeals process possible.33 Yet this is unlikely to work unless platforms get the backbone to strongly assert their rights to set the criteria, stick to them, and stop constantly adjusting them based on the vagaries of daily political pressures. At worst, advocates of more content moderation are motivated by a belief that greater content control will reflect their own personal values and priorities. But since calls for tougher or more extensive content moderation come from all ideological and cultural directions, this expectation is unrealistic. It will only lead to a distributed form of the heckler’s veto, and a complete absence of predictable, relatively objective standards. It is not uncommon for outrage at social media to lead in contradictory directions. A reporter for _The Guardian_ , for example, is outraged that Facebook has an ad‐​targeting category for “vaccine controversies” and flogs the company for allowing anti‐​vaccination advocates to form closed groups that can reinforce those members’ resistance to mainstream medical care.34 However, there is no way for Facebook to intervene without profiling their users as part of a specific political movement deemed to be wrong, and then suppressing their communications and their ability to associate based on that data. So, at the same time Facebook is widely attacked for privacy violations, it is also being asked to leverage its private user data to flag political and social beliefs that are deemed aberrant and to suppress users’ ability to associate, connect with advertisers, or communicate among themselves. In this combination of surveillance and suppression, what could possibly go wrong?



What stance should advocates of both free expression and free markets take with respect to social media?



First, there needs to be a clearer articulation of the tremendous value of platforms based on their ability to match seekers and providers of information. There also needs to be explicit advocacy for greater tolerance of the jarring diversity revealed by these processes. True liberals need to make it clear that social media platforms cannot be expected to bear the main responsibility for sheltering us from ideas, people, messages, and cultures that we consider wrong or that offend us. Most of the responsibility for what we see and what we avoid should lie with us. If we are outraged by seeing things we don’t like in online communities comprised of billions of people, we need to stop misdirecting that outrage against the platforms that happen to expose us to it. Likewise, if the exposed behavior is illegal, we need to focus on identifying the perpetrators and holding them accountable. As a corollary of this attitudinal change, we also need to show that the hypertransparency fostered by social media can have great social value. As a simple example of this, research has shown that the much‐​maligned rise of platforms matching female sex workers with clients is statistically correlated with a decrease in violence against women — precisely because it took sex work off the street and made transactions more visible and controllable.35



Second, free‐​expression supporters need to actively challenge those who want content moderation to go further. We need to expose the fact that they are using social media as a means of reforming and reshaping society, wielding it like a hammer against norms and values they want to be eradicated from the world. These viewpoints are leading us down an authoritarian blind alley. They may very well succeed in suppressing and crippling the freedom of digital media, but they will not, and cannot, succeed in improving society. Instead, they will make social media platforms battlegrounds for a perpetual intensifying conflict over who gets to silence whom. This is already abundantly clear from the cries of discrimination and bias as the platforms ratchet up content moderation: the cries come from both the left and the right in response to moderation that is often experienced as arbitrary.



Finally, we need to mount a renewed and reinvigorated defense of Section 230. The case for Section 230 is simple: no alternative promises to be intrinsically better than what we have now, and most alternatives are likely to be worse. The exaggerations generated by the moral panic have obscured the simple fact that moderating content on a global platform with billions of users is an extraordinarily difficult and demanding task. Users, not platforms, are the source of messages, videos, and images that people find objectionable, so calls for regulation ignore the fact that regulations don’t govern a single supplier, but must govern millions, and maybe billions, of users. The task of flagging user‐​generated content, considering it, and deciding what to do about it is difficult and expensive. And is best left to the platforms.



However, regulation seems to be coming. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has published a blog post calling for regulating the internet, and the UK government has released a white paper, “Online Harms,” that proposes the imposition of systematic liability for user‐​generated content on all internet intermediaries (including hosting companies and internet service providers).36



At best, a system of content regulation influenced by government is going to look very much like what is happening now. Government‐​mandated standards for content moderation would inevitably put most of the responsibility for censorship on the platforms themselves. Even in China, with its army of censors, the operationalization of censorship relies heavily on the platform operators. In the tsunami of content unleashed by social media, prior restraint by the state is not really an option. Germany responded in a similar fashion with the 2017 Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz, or Network Enforcement Act (popularly known as NetzDG or the Facebook Act), a law aimed at combating agitation, hate speech, and fake news in social networks.



The NetzDG law immediately resulted in suppression of various forms of politically controversial online speech. Joachim Steinhöfel, a German lawyer concerned by Facebook’s essentially jurisprudential role under NetzDG, created a “wall of shame” containing legal content suppressed by NetzDG.37 Ironically, German right‐​wing nationalists who suffered takedowns under the new law turned the law to their advantage by using it to suppress critical or demeaning comments about themselves. “Germany’s attempt to regulate speech online has seemingly amplified the voices it was trying to diminish,” claims an article in _The Atlantic_.38 As a result of one right‐​wing politician’s petition, Facebook must ensure that individuals in Germany cannot use a VPN to access illegal content. Yet still, a report by an anti‐​hate‐​speech group that supports the law argues that it has been ineffective. “There have been no fines imposed on companies and little change in overall takedown rates.”39



Abandoning intermediary immunities would make the platforms even more conservative and more prone to disable accounts or take down content than they are now. In terms of costs and legal risks, it will make sense for them to err on the safe side. When intermediaries are given legal responsibility, conflicts about arbitrariness and false positives don’t go away, they intensify. In authoritarian countries, platforms will be merely be indirect implementers of national censorship standards and laws.



On the other hand, U.S. politicians face a unique and interesting dilemma. If they think they can capitalize on social media’s travails with calls for regulation, they must understand that governmental involvement in content regulation would have to conform to the First Amendment. This would mean that all kinds of content that many users don’t want to see, ranging from hate speech to various levels of nudity, could no longer be restricted because they are _not_ strictly illegal. Any government interventions that took down postings or deleted accounts could be litigated based on a First Amendment standard. Ironically, then, a governmental takeover of content regulation responsibilities in the United States would have to be far more liberal than the status quo. Avoidance of this outcome was precisely why Section 230 was passed in the first place.



From a pure free‐​expression standpoint, a First Amendment approach would be a good thing. But from a free‐​association and free‐​market standpoint, it would not. Such a policy would literally force all social media users to be exposed to things they didn’t want to be exposed to. It would undermine the economic value of platforms by decapitating their ability to manage their matching algorithms, shape their environment, and optimize the tradeoffs of a multisided market. Given the current hue and cry about all the bad things people are seeing and doing on social media, a legally driven, permissive First Amendment standard does not seem like it would make anyone happy.



Advocates of expressive freedom, therefore, need to reassert the importance of Section 230. Platforms, not the state, should be responsible for finding the optimal balance between content moderation, freedom of expression, and the economic value of platforms. The alternative of greater government regulation would absolve the platforms of market responsibility for their decisions. It would eliminate competition among platforms for appropriate moderation standards and practices and would probably lead them to exclude and suppress even more legal speech than they do now.



Content regulation is only the most prominent of the issues faced by social media platforms today; they are also implicated in privacy and competition‐​policy controversies. But social media content regulation has been the exclusive focus of this analysis. Hypertransparency and the subsequent demand for content control it creates are the key drivers of the new media moral panic. The panic is feeding upon itself, creating conditions for policy reactions that overlook or openly challenge values regarding free expression and free enterprise. While there is a lot to dislike about Facebook and other social media platforms, it’s time we realized that a great deal of that negative reaction stems from an information society contemplating manifestations of itself. It is not an exaggeration to say that we are blaming the mirror for what we see in it. Section 230 is still surprisingly relevant to this dilemma. As a policy, Section 230 was not a form of infant industry protection that we can dispense with now, nor was it a product of a utopian inebriation with the potential of the internet. It was a very clever way of distributing responsibility for content governance in social media. If we stick with this arrangement, learn more tolerance, and take more responsibility for what we see and do on social media, we can respond to the problems while retaining the benefits.

"MODERN homes today are getting   light bulbs, thermostats, TVs and speakers. So with a simple voice command or the touch of a button on our smartphones, we can set the temperature, turn on a light or prepare the TV to record a program. What could go wrong? A lot more than most people are prepared for, it turns out. If one of these devices gets hijacked, hackers could potentially snoop around for sensitive data like financial or health information. Or they could use a network of compromised devices to perform a widespread attack that takes down major websites, which is what happened last October. The good news is that so far, online attacks on home devices are relatively uncommon. Only 10 percent of American consumers said they were victims of the crime in a recent study done for the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company. However, those who experienced such an attack through their home gadgets reported losses of $1, 000 to $5, 000 from the incidents. “There’s still this whole sort of, ‘Gee whiz, it’s so cool’ thing that’s going on” with   home appliances, said Lee Tien, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on digital rights. “That’s also what often gets us into trouble. ” As smart home devices become more popular, they will become bigger targets for hackers. So it behooves us to get ahead of the curve by securing our home appliances, using these tips from security experts who have closely studied smart home accessories. When shopping for an   home device like a smart speaker, lighting system or television set, a good rule of thumb is to go with a trusted brand. Larger,   companies like Amazon or Google have a background in developing products with security in mind, said Liviu Arsene, an analyst for Bitdefender, which sells security hardware for protecting smart home accessories. Before buying a product, consumers should do a web search on it to see if the company regularly issues software updates that fix security vulnerabilities, he said. People should also carefully read company privacy policies. David Britton, a vice president in the fraud and identity department of Experian, the credit reporting agency, said people should be curious about whether companies themselves were a threat to user privacy. “What are they capturing about you?” he said. “Is the data leaving the device? Is it being sent back to the mother ship?” Consider the smart speakers from Amazon and Google. Amazon said its Alexa smart assistant, which is used in its Echo speakers, automatically downloads software updates to defend against new security threats. Data from the Echo is also uploaded to Amazon’s servers only after people utter the wake word “Alexa,” the company said. That minimizes the likelihood that the device will record conversations unrelated to requests intended for Alexa. Google said its Home speaker similarly issued regular software updates and employed advanced security features, like a technique that disables the device if its software is tampered with. The company added that the speaker processed speech only after the words “O. K. Google” or “Hey Google” were detected. But other large brands occasionally engage in behavior that customers may find objectionable. The smart TV maker Vizio, for example, made headlines with revelations from the investigative news site ProPublica that it kept a detailed record of customer viewing habits and shared it with advertisers, who could then use the information to identify other devices you owned. Your   network is the pulse of your smart home, thus it is a vulnerable attack point. Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene suggest connecting all your smart home accessories  —   for example, your Amazon Echo, Nest thermostat, Samsung smart refrigerator and Philips Hue smart lights  —   onto a   network that is separate from the one connected to your computing devices, like your smartphone, tablet and computer. With two distinct   networks, it will be harder for a hacker to jump from infiltrating your smart accessory on one network to a personal computer on the other network, Mr. Arsene said. The easiest way to create a second   network is to make a guest network. Many modern   routers, like  ’s Archer C7 (the top router recommended by The Wirecutter, a product recommendations site owned by The New York Times) include the ability to host a network for guests that uses a name and password different from that of your primary network. Quarantining your smart speakers, lights and TV onto a guest network will allow them all to interact with one another, while keeping your computing devices safer in the event that any of the smart accessories are hacked. If you are paranoid about your   network being hacked, you can also change the   router’s network settings to disable broadcasting the network name entirely, Mr. Britton said. That would make it difficult for a hacker driving by to detect and compromise your network, though it would also require house guests to manually type in your network name and password when they log on to your  . The same security principles for websites apply to the   internet of things. You should set strong, unique passwords for logging into each device you own. If you recycle your passwords and one device is compromised, the others can be, too. A strong password can be a random string of characters or a nonsensical phrase with numbers and special characters. (Examples: My favorite number is Green4782# or The cat ate the CoTTon candy 224%.) If you cannot memorize your passwords, that is a good thing: That means they are hard for hackers to crack. Keep them written down on a piece of paper and stored in a safe place, or store your passwords in a   app like 1Password or LastPass. While reputable manufacturers of smart home accessories offer software updates to patch security vulnerabilities, it is often up to the consumer to stay on top of updates. Because it lacks a screen, a smart light bulb or an   power socket is going to have a tough time informing you that it needs a software update. Mr. Britton and Mr. Arsene recommend that consumers regularly log into the mobile apps or websites for their smart home accessories to check if they need software updates. If updates are available, install them immediately. Among security researchers, putting a piece of tape over a computer webcam has become a    recommendation for those who are extra paranoid about their privacy. (Even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, does it.) With smart speakers like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, there is an equivalent: a mute button to disable the device microphone so it can no longer listen. In the unlikely event that a device is hijacked, muting the microphone could help prevent hackers from listening to your conversations, Mr. Britton said. Or you could go the safest route and opt out of having these devices at all. That was the method chosen by Mr. Tien, the lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who previously studied the privacy risks of smart meters, the devices that utility companies use to monitor energy consumption. He said he accepted the privacy implications of owning a smartphone, but a smart home accessory? “I think it’s sort of asking to have your privacy invaded to have something like that,” he said. “I’m not sure that the value of it is really all that great. ”"
"**A range of apps on iPhones and iPads stopped working on Friday, with Facebook admitting it was to blame.**
The firm told the BBC that ""a code change triggered crashes for some iOS apps"" but that the issue was ""quickly resolved"".
Apps such as Spotify, TikTok, Tinder and Waze were unusable for a few hours.
Angry users took to social media while DownDetector, which monitors net blackouts, reported widespread outages.
A similar issue happened in May, affecting services for part of a day.
Of this latest failure, Facebook said in a statement: ""Earlier today, a code change triggered crashes for some iOS apps using the Facebook SDK [software developer kit]. We identified the issue quickly and resolved it. We apologise for any inconvenience.""
The issues occur because app developers are encouraged to integrate the ""login with Facebook"" feature, in order for the social network to take advantage of the data the apps collect on users. It means that any updates will directly affect them.
The two incidents have led some to question whether Facebook has too much power over independent apps.
Writing in May after the first crash, app developer Guilherme Rambo wrote: ""It was as if Facebook had an 'app kill switch' that they activated and it brought down many of people's favourite iOS apps.
""Of course it was a bug and not something done intentionally, but it highlights the point that they do have control over apps that include their code.""
The problems frustrated many users, but TechCrunch's security editor Zack Whittaker did point out advantages: ""At least on the bright side, for a short while this morning none of your apps were quietly uploading your data to brokers and analytics firms without your knowledge"".
And plenty of Android users commented that their apps were ""working fine""."

Guest Post by Willis Eschenbach
I got to thinking about the well-known correlation of El Ninos and global temperature. I knew that the Pacific temperatures lead the global temperatures, and the tropics lead the Pacific, but I’d never looked at the actual physical distribution of the correlation. So I went to the CERES dataset, and Figure 1 shows the result.
Figure 1. Correlation of detrended gridcell temperatures with the global temperature two months later. Blue square shows the extent of the 3D section shown in Figure 2. Gray lines show the zero value.
The joy of science to me is wondering what the final map will look like. This map made me laugh when it came up on the silver screen. I laughed because it’s a very good map of the path of the warm water pumped from the equator to the poles by the magnificent El Nino pump. I didn’t expect that at all.
To understand why a map showing each gridcell’s correlation with the planetary temperature two months later should also be a great map of the path of the water pumped by the El Nino pump, let’s consider the action of the pump in detail. Figure 2 shows a 3D section of the Pacific showing the ocean before and after the power stroke of the El Nino pump.


Figure 2. 3D section of the Pacific Ocean looking westward along the equator. The area covered is the blue box at the equator in Figure 1. Click on image for larger size. ORIGINAL CAPTION: This is a view of the current El Nino / La Nina evolving in the tropical Pacific Ocean. You are looking westward, across the equator in the Pacific Ocean, from a vantage point somewhere in the Andes Mountains in South America. The colored surfaces show TAO/TRITON ocean temperatures. The top surface is the sea-surface, from 8°N to 8°S and from 137°E to 95°W. The shape of the sea surface is determined by TAO/TRITON Dynamic Height data. The wide vertical surface is at 8°S and extends to 500 meters depth. The narrower vertical surface is at 95°W. SOURCE: click on “Animation”.
Now, every intermittent pump has a “power stroke” when it does the actual pumping. For example, the power stroke of your heart is marked by the “beat” of your heartbeat. (The heart has two pumping chambers, so there are two power strokes, with their timing signified by the “lub-dub” of your heartbeat.) The power stroke is the time when the work is done—it is the portion of the cycle where the water is moved by the pump. Figure 2 shows the situation before and after the power stroke of the El Nino pump.
On the left of Figure 2, we have the condition prior to the power stroke of the El Nino pump. In this condition, there is a build-up of warm water on the surface. As you might imagine, this also warms the atmosphere above it, and a few months later the warmth spreads to the planet as well.
However, when the amount of this warm water reaches a critical point, the El Nino phenomenon emerges. The wind that powers the El Nino pump arises, and it begins to blow. This wind blows the warm surface water strongly westwards. Essentially, the wind skims off the warm surface layer and pushes it all along the equator until it meets up with continental arc. This movement of untold cubic kilometres of water is the result of the power stroke of the El Nino pump.
On the right of Figure 2, we have the condition after the power stroke, when the wind has  already blown the warm surface water westwards. Note that the cooler subsurface layers have been exposed. These layers are up to as much as 10°C cooler than the surface was  before the power stroke. Naturally, the exposure of this huge area of cool water cools the atmosphere and thus the planet.
So with that as prologue, why does the correlation map of Figure 1 show the track taken by the warm water? It’s all a matter of timing.
Consider what happens when the El Nino pump skims off the warm surface of the equatorial Pacific waters. When the cool subsurface water is exposed all across that huge tropical area, first the Pacific atmosphere and then the whole planet starts to cool.
But actually, that’s not quite true. The whole planet doesn’t cool … because the warm surface water moved by the El Nino pump has to go somewhere. This means that the previously cooler areas to which the warm tropical water has been pumped are warming, while the rest of the planet is cooling … and as a result, we get the lovely blue and green areas of negative correlation shown in the western Pacific in Figure 1.
These areas demonstrate that when the warm Equatorial water hits the Asian continent and the shallow-water arc connecting Asia to Australia, the water pumped by the El Nino splits into two parts. One part of the warm water goes north, and one goes south.
And of course, like the other emergent climate phenomena, the El Nino pump functions to keep the Pacific from overheating. When there is a buildup of warm water, the El Nino pump emerges, pumps the warm water to the poles along the path shown in Figure 1, and then disappears until it is needed once again.
I can only stand in awe. This is a most ingenious method for temperature regulation. When the warm Pacific tropical surface waters get overheated, an emergent pumping system arises, which pumps the warm water polewards and exposes the cooler water underneath, and the cooler ocean waters in turn bring down the temperature of the whole planet … brilliant.
My regards to everyone,
w.
AS ALWAYS: If you disagree with something I’ve said, please quote the exact words you disagree with. That way all of us can understand exactly what you object to.
PS—It does strike me that with both a positively correlated and a negatively correlated area regarding the global temperature two months later, we should at least be able to forecast a few key climate parameters for a couple of months ahead …

"Sometimes even the largest natural wonders can remain hidden from human view for centuries. The Amazon is a dense place, full of life with new species of flora and fauna being discovered every other day. Now, using the same technology that takes driverless cars from A to B, we – led by Eric Gorgens and Diego Armando da Silva, and along with colleagues from Brazil, Swansea, Oxford and Cambridge – have discovered the tallest tree in the rainforest. At 88m tall, it dwarfs the previous record holders by almost 30m. And it’s not alone either. The Guiana Shield of north-eastern Amazonia, which accounts for nearly 9% of the world’s remaining tropical forests, may contain lots of these gigantic trees. With each one able to hold as much carbon as an average hectare of rainforest, our discovery means that the vast jungle may be a greater carbon sink than previously thought. We didn’t just stumble upon these trees while strolling in the forest. Between 2016 and 2018, Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research coordinated a project to laser scan large swaths of the Amazon. This project scanned 850 randomly distributed patches of forest, each 12km long and 300m wide. Seven of these patches contained evidence of trees taller than 80m. Most of them were located in the area surrounding the Jari river, a northern tributary of the Amazon. Even we were surprised by the mammoth tree heights that the scans reported, so we set out on a journey to confirm the findings with our own eyes, determine their species and, of course, climb them. We set off by boat from Laranjal do Jari in north-eastern Brazil, in humid 35℃ heat. The first stage of our journey took us to the village of São Francisco do Iratapuru, a community who produce sustainable brazil nuts. The community provided four boats and 12 people to guide us up the river and through the dense and unforgiving forest. Without their expert assistance we wouldn’t have cleared the hurdles that followed – the first of which was the Itacará waterfall. It took us all of the second day to haul the heavy wooden boats and all of our gear around over land carpeted with thick vegetation to avoid it. Beyond Itacará, the river ranged from 300m wide and serene to 30m with rocks and rapids. We were relieved to see that someone had packed plenty of spare propellers for the outboard motors – by the end of the trip we had used every single one. At one point our propeller hit a submerged rock and snapped, leaving us without power or steering just as we were trying to force our way upstream through a section of rapids. We crossed the equator on the third day and covered 70km, before spending most of the next day waist deep in the river, hauling the boats up through eight kilometres of rapids and rocks with ropes and hands. Having travelled 240km in total, we finally arrived at base camp on the sixth day. Many of the tall trees were pretty close to the river, so we could visit them quite easily from our camp – although cutting through the dense undergrowth was such tough work that we didn’t have time to visit all of the target sites revealed by the laser data. We spent the next few days collecting samples and taking measurements of the trees. The highlight was our climber, Fabiano, shooting straight up the trees to measure their height the old-fashioned way – by dangling a rope from the top. We found at least 15 giant trees, all of which were over 70m tall and some easily topping 80 m. Surprisingly in this diverse tropical forest, all these trees were of the same species – Angelim vermelho (Dinizia excelsa). This species is common in the Amazon, often used for timber because of its strong, albeit smelly wood. Previously, hoever, it was thought to grow to only 60m. We don’t yet know how these trees managed to grow so much higher. As pioneer species – the first to grow into any new areas or gaps in vegetation – it’s possible that they took advantage of some past disturbance that cleared part of the forest, perhaps caused by a storm or by human habitation. The fact that they have survived so long and grown so tall must be at least in part thanks to their sheer remoteness from urban areas and industry. The laser scanning technology that has enabled this and other recent mammoth tree discoveries isn’t just a plaything for tree lovers. It allows scientists to map forest structure and carbon storage in amazing detail and at unprecedented scales, and so better assess their importance in the global carbon cycle. A number of projects are also collecting repeat data, which will allow us to monitor the changing health in vital forests like these. In this case, our research suggests that the north-east of the Amazon could store far more carbon than previously thought. Each Angelim vermelho can store as many as 40 tonnes of carbon – that’s between 300 and 500 smaller trees, while occupying the space of only 20. And although we only visited 15 trees, this was a small proportion of the trees the laser scanning data revealed, which was itself covered only a tiny proportion of the Guiana Shield.

      Amazon fires: eight ways you can help stop the rainforest burning


 In the current political climate, there are plenty of reasons to worry about the Amazon, but there is also still room for wonder. The fact that discoveries like these are still being made – even while parts of the forest are being destroyed by logging, burning and agricultural expansion – demonstrates how much there is still to learn about this amazing and mysterious ecosystem. Sadly, it is likely that many unknown species in the Amazon will become extinct before we even discover them. We must do all we can to protect this majestic rainforest and the treasures – both known and undiscovered – it holds within. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

"YANGON, Myanmar  —   The   rights lawyer had devised a plan to replace Myanmar’s Constitution with one that would strip the military of its extraordinary political powers. The lawyer, U Ko Ni, a top adviser to the governing National League for Democracy, had recently been working on a new draft, a colleague said, and he hoped to promote his project at a conference this month. But when he returned to the Yangon airport on Sunday from a trip to Indonesia, cradling his young grandson in his arms as he waited for a taxi, a man drew a pistol and shot him in the head. The killing appears to have been a rare political assassination in Myanmar, fueling rumors, distrust and worry about the country’s future. “This bullet was not only for Ko Ni,” the colleague, U Thein Than Oo, a human rights lawyer in Mandalay, Myanmar, said by telephone. “It was for the N. L. D. and the people who want to amend and replace the 2008 Constitution and support the peace process. ” The Myanmar police have said that the assailant, detained shortly after the shooting, was a professional hit man, and they  have arrested three other suspects in the attack, including the man they say hired the killer. The police have not announced a motive for the killing. It is not clear whether Mr. Ko Ni could have succeeded in changing the Constitution, although colleagues said he had been pressing the case. While unverified rumors swirled on Myanmar’s social media this week that the military was behind the killing, the police said there was no evidence to support the claims. The assistant secretary of the   Home Affairs Ministry, U Maung Maung Myint, issued a statement on Wednesday denying rumors that the home affairs minister, Lt. Gen. Kyaw Swe, had orchestrated the killing. But even as a few details began to leak out, there were still more questions than answers. Those guessing at motives noted that Mr. Ko Ni, 65, was one of the country’s most prominent Muslims in a majority Buddhist country torn by religious strife. But he was hardly a firebrand. While he did not hesitate to advocate the legal rights of Muslims and other minorities whenever he felt they were threatened, he did not promote Islamic law and he backed a decision by the National League for Democracy not to field Muslim candidates in the 2015 election, telling a reporter at the time that it was not worth it given the polarized political climate. Instead, he expressed an inclusive vision that was shaped in part by his background as the son of an ethnic Burmese and Buddhist mother and a Muslim father from India. “He was a man who could appreciate different traditions precisely because his own tradition in his country did not always receive the respect that it deserved,” said Melissa Crouch, an expert on Myanmar’s Constitution at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The main suspect, U Kyi Lin, had been jailed from 2003 to 2014 for smuggling ancient Buddha statues, according to police statements and leaked police documents. That would hardly be the profile of a radical Buddhist. Mr. Kyi Lin was pardoned in 2014 in a prisoner amnesty by the government of former President Thein Sein, who was an army general. Some lawyers wondered how the gunman had acquired a   pistol, which is manufactured by the Myanmar Army, in a country where civilian firearm sales have been prohibited for decades. There was also speculation about how the attacker could have carried out the killing in daylight in a public place that is among the country’s most secure and that regularly hosts national and foreign dignitaries. All of which lead Mr. Ko Ni’s friends and colleagues back to his efforts to challenge the military and its powerful supporters. A canny constitutional lawyer, Mr. Ko Ni had outmaneuvered the military before. Before the military dictatorship that ruled Myanmar for nearly 50 years allowed democratic elections, it left in place a Constitution that barred anyone with a spouse or child with foreign citizenship from becoming president. That clause was aimed at one person: Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the popular Nobel laureate and leader of the National League for Democracy, whose husband, now dead, was British and whose sons are also British citizens. Mr. Ko Ni is widely credited with helping devise the strategy that allowed her to take power after her party won a landslide election in 2015. Parliament created a new position, state counselor, that would be above the president and appointed her to the job. Richard Horsey, a political analyst and former United Nations official in Yangon, called the move a legal “fudge” that may have survived because Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party controlled the courts. But he said that Mr. Ko Ni was among the most knowledgeable legal minds in the National League for Democracy orbit. “There aren’t many people like that, so in that sense, he played a very important role,” Mr. Horsey said. But the party has long had another target: eliminating the special powers for the military enshrined in the Constitution, including a crucial veto. The veto is actually two parts: a quota that allocates a quarter of the seats in Parliament to the military, and the requirement of a 75 percent majority to pass a constitutional amendment. Mr. Ko Ni had proposed introducing a bill on a referendum about drafting a new constitution. The bill could be passed with a simple majority, which the National League for Democracy could easily muster. “If the military still focuses on protecting its interests, it will be impossible to change any part of the Constitution within Parliament,” he said last year, according to The Myanmar Times. “That’s why writing a new one is the best way to pursue a democratic Constitution. ” Party officials, however, have not publicly endorsed this solution, and U Win Htein, a party leader contacted this week, said the party still favored amending, rather than replacing, the Constitution. But Mr. Ko Ni was still promoting the idea, and one colleague, Mr. Thein Than Oo, said that “one of his last works” had been drafting a new Constitution. The consequences of the killing for the country will depend on what motive is ultimately established, as well as the transparency of the police investigation. But the killing has already demonstrated that the rule of law in Myanmar remains fragile, and it could further erode the National League for Democracy’s ability to govern, said Elliot Brennan, a Myanmar specialist and a research fellow at the Institute for Security and Development Policy in Stockholm. Initial expectations that the party could bring major changes to Myanmar were “far too high, and we’ve been waiting for the expectations, the red balloon, to pop,” he said. “The assassination might not be the final pinprick, but we’re getting very close. ” That the party leadership has said little about the killing has raised questions about its ability to handle the situation. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who has faced international criticism for recent military operations in   Rakhine State against the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority, has also been rebuked. The office of Myanmar’s president, U Htin Kyaw, said in a statement on Monday that the attack had been carried out to undermine the country’s stability. U Zaw Htay, a spokesman for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, later said that the statement by the president’s office had been made on her behalf. But Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi did not attend Mr. Ko Ni’s funeral, and his daughter, Dr. Yin Nwe Khaine, said on Wednesday that, to the best of her knowledge, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had not sent condolences. She said she knew that her father’s work carried risks, but that he never talked about them at home. “He always said that lawyers are forever worrying, and he never wanted to pass those worries on to his family,” she said by telephone, fighting back tears. But he did train her to be strong in difficult times, she added, and this was one of them. “My father is my hero,” she said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFormer German Economics Minister Wolfgang Clement of the socialist SPD party says Germany’s once highly ballyhooed “Energiewende” (transition to green energy) “has careened completely out of control” and has hurt the country economically.

Germany’s former Economics Minister under Chancellor Gerhard Schroder calls the country’s “Energiewende” a disaster. Photo: www.bmwa.bund.de.htm.
The online Handelsblatt here reports that the former “Super Minister” in Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s SPD-Green government (1998-2005) has launched “sharp criticism” at the country’s energy transition, claiming the plan is in chaos and that there’s been a “lack of political, legal and technical synchronization“.
He also says the naivety involved in implementing green energies has been “breathtaking” and has turned into “a disaster”.

When it comes to the plan to implement the transition to green energy, Clement says there hasn’t been a plan, rather there has been 17 of them: one by the federal government and one by each of the 16 German states, all working disharmoniously and chaotically.
Clement added that the dumping of surplus unneeded green energy into foreign markets has been “one of the most dreadful businesses that has ever burdened the German economy“.
He also calls the expectation that Europe can somehow isolate itself from competition from cheap nuclear power coming from outside of its borders “crazy”.
Germany’s Energiewende has been sharply criticized in the past as it is in large part the main driver behind the country’s skyrocketing electricity prices, unstable power grid conditions, growing energy poverty and for marring the landscape with inefficient and ugly industrial wind turbines.
According to Clement, Germany’s electricity prices are among the very highest in Europe and has led energy intensive heavy industries to pack up and leave. Clement says a number of industries are now “under massive pressure”.

"Precipitous declines in print advertising rocked the newspaper industry last year. And while The New York Times Company recorded significant growth in subscriptions and promising increases in digital advertising, it nevertheless has not avoided the inevitable. The company said on Thursday that its print advertising revenue in 2016 fell 16 percent, driving a 9 percent drop in total advertising revenue. For the quarter, print advertising revenue declined 20 percent. The story on the digital side was positive, underscoring the diverging financial narratives for print and digital that have emerged at the company. Digital advertising revenue rose 6 percent last year, to $209 million. The Times Company added 514, 000 net   subscriptions for its news products during the year, bringing its total to 1. 6 million. Buoyed by readers’ intense interest in the presidential election, the company added 276, 000 net   subscriptions to its news products in the last three months of the year, more additions than in 2013 and 2014 combined. Including print and crossword product subscriptions, The New York Times now has more than three million total paid subscribers, a milestone that aligns with the company’s commitment to a   revenue model that is less reliant on the advertising revenue derived from page views and clicks. As for many other legacy print companies trying to adapt to an increasingly digital world, these have been challenging times for The New York Times. Last month, The Times released an internal report that called for swift changes in the newsroom, including more staff training, a commitment to hiring journalists with   skills and an elimination of duplicative layers of editing. That has left employees bracing for staff reductions that newsroom leaders said could be announced in the next several weeks. Despite positive developments on the digital side, the overall financial results announced on Thursday are unlikely to assuage the tangible anxiety among journalists at The Times. Total revenue fell about 2 percent for the year, to $1. 6 billion, and 1 percent in the quarter, to $440 million. Adjusted operating profit, the company’s preferred method for assessing performance, fell to $241 million last year, from $289 million in 2015. Operating profit dropped to $102 million, from $137 million. For the quarter, adjusted operating profit was $96 million, compared with $118 million in the fourth quarter in 2015. Operating profit fell to $56 million, from $88 million. On a more positive note, circulation revenue rose 3 percent in 2016, to $881 million. Revenue from the company’s   subscriptions jumped 17 percent in 2016, to $233 million. For the quarter, circulation revenue increased 5 percent, to $226 million, and   subscription revenue rose 22 percent, to $64 million. Digital advertising revenue rose 11 percent. In an earnings call on Thursday, Mark Thompson, chief executive of the Times Company, called digital growth “unprecedented” and expressed optimism in the company’s   growth strategy. He also used the call to needle President Trump over his claims that the publication’s audience and subscriber numbers were “dwindling. ” “Not so much, Mr. President,” Mr. Thompson said. “We had spectacular audiences in the quarter. ” Times executives said the company expected circulation revenues to increase about 6 percent in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the same quarter last year. The company also expected to see about 200, 000 net additional subscriptions to its digital news products in the first quarter. Total advertising revenue is forecast to fall in the high single digits, though digital advertising revenue is expected to increase 10 to 15 percent. On Wednesday, The Times announced the promotion of Clifford J. Levy, a top digital editor, to the position of deputy managing editor. On Thursday, the company announced a partnership with Snapchat to create a new daily edition for the app’s Discover section, with the aim of gaining exposure to a younger audience."

White roofs three times as effective as green roofs
Green roof of City Hall in Chicago, Illinois.
From Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and some members of the BEST team comes this surprise.
“We conclude that the choice of white vs. extensive green roof should be based on the environmental and societal concerns of the decision-maker. If global warming is a major concern, white roofs, which are around three times as effective at cooling the globe as green roofs, will be the preferred choice. On the other hand if the local environment is a primary interest, green roofs will be preferred. Of course, stormwater management may be a decisive factor in favor of green roofs, particularly in the presence of strict local stormwater regulations.”
The paper: 
Economic comparison of white, green, and black flat roofs in the United States Julian Sproul,Man Pun Wan, Benjamin H. Mandel, Arthur H. Rosenfeld

Highlights
• The life-cycle costs of white roofs are less than those of black roofs.
• Green roofs are more expensive over their life-cycle than white or black roofs.
• Green roofs’ high installation/replacement costs outweigh their long service lives.
• Per unit area, white roofs cool the globe 3× more effectively than green roofs.
• Dark roofs should be phased out in warm climates for public health purposes.

Abstract
White and “green” (vegetated) roofs have begun replacing conventional black (dark-colored) roofs to mitigate the adverse effects of dark impervious urban surfaces. This paper presents an economic perspective on roof color choice using a 50-year life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA). We find that relative to black roofs, white roofs provide a 50-year net savings (NS) of $25/m2 ($2.40/ft2) and green roofs have a negative NS of $71/m2 ($6.60/ft2). Despite lasting at least twice as long as white or black roofs, green roofs cannot compensate for their installation cost premium. However, while the 50-year NS of white roofs compared to green roofs is $96/m2 ($8.90/ft2), the annualized cost premium is just $3.20/m2-year ($0.30/ft2-year). This annual difference is sufficiently small that the choice between a white and green roof should be based on preferences of the building owner. Owners concerned with global warming should choose white roofs, which are three times more effective than green roofs at cooling the globe. Owners concerned with local environmental benefits should choose green roofs, which offer built-in stormwater management and a “natural” urban landscape esthetic. We strongly recommend building code policies that phase out dark-colored roofs in warm climates to protect against their adverse public health externalities.

"The number of breeding birds in the UK has fallen by 44m since the 1970s. That’s just one of the shocking statistics highlighted in the new State of Nature 2019 report, the third of its kind to detail how the country’s wildlife has changed over the past four decades. The report – produced by a partnership of more than 70 nature-based organisations including the RSPB, Plantlife and The Wildlife Trusts – evaluates whether our actions are helping, or hindering, nature. The report shows most species have declined since the 1970s, and continue to decline today. As its authors put it: “There has been no let-up in the net loss of nature”.  There are some positives: of the 696 terrestrial and freshwater species monitored, 26% showed increases in abundance, and 36% increased when looking at the past decade alone. Nevertheless, the UK’s wildlife has already been decimated through centuries of threats, including persecution and pollution, so current figures highlight only a small proportion of nature loss.  Here are the top five threats: More than two thirds of UK land is currently managed to produce food for subsistence and profit. The past 50 years has seen more mechanisation, increased use of pesticides and fertilisers, and the removal of features like hedgerows, field margins and ponds. This has been great for productivity but terrible for wildlife, making agricultural practices the main threat to UK biodiversity.  For instance, the report highlights how a simple change to autumn sowing of crops has devastated skylark populations by causing a loss of over-winter seed availability, and creating crops that are too tall and dense to support nesting late in the season. Consequently, farmland bird populations have declined by 54%. Nature-friendly farming – both voluntary and supported by government-funded agri-environment schemes – encourages less pesticide use, reverting to spring-sown cereals, and reinstating hedgerows and field margins, which have the potential to halt and reverse species declines. So far, these declines have only been slowed, highlighting the complex interactions of threats, and lack of coordinated action on a landscape scale. Pollutants include plastic waste, light and noise, or chemicals in water, soil and air, with new pollutants such as pharmaceuticals continuing to emerge. Transport, industry and farming are key pollution sources. Nitrogen enrichment, caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as natural gas, has produced a decline in more than 60% of wildflower species that, in turn, impact on the moth larvae that depend on them. The good news is that coordinated legislative control across Europe has caused marked reductions in many of these pollutants. Since the 1970s, the report notes that sulphur emissions from coal-fired power stations that cause acid rain have decreased by 97%. And the River Thames, previously declared “biologically dead”, supported at least 100 seal pups this year – it’s one of the 35% of water bodies now classed as high or good according to the EU Water Framework Directive. Since the 1980s, UK temperatures have increased by 1℃. This affects the range and abundance of certain species, and throws the timing of key events out of sync – plants and invertebrates now respond to the arrival of spring four days earlier, yet birds only respond two days earlier, causing the availability of prey and the timing of peak predator requirements to become misaligned. Species have also moved north by around 20 kilometres per decade, but these shifts rely on suitable habitat, so the impacts of climate change can be exacerbated through threats like agricultural management. Climate change mitigation schemes protect nature-rich areas – protected areas are four times more likely to be colonised by species – and large-scale restoration projects have commenced, such as blocking drainage ditches and creating bunds to hold water within bogs that have been lost through drying. Urbanisation has fragmented the landscape and lost valuable habitat. For instance, the report notes the loss of heathland across the UK has caused a decrease in the number of reptiles such as sand lizards and smooth snakes. Planning policy in England and Wales now encourages new developments to create net gains for nature. Habitat restoration schemes including Naturehood, supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, encourage people and communities to work together to enhance green spaces such as gardens, parks, allotments, and ponds, to create connectivity between habitats and enhance ecosystem function. Many species such as foxes and peregrine falcons have adapted to urbanisation, and gardens are now recognised as pollinator hotspots.  More than 2,000 non-native species have established themselves in the UK, and they bring a variety of threats. Some outcompete native species, such as the American mink and the native water vole. Others spread disease that only natives are susceptible to, shown by the American grey squirrel who passes pox on to our native red squirrel, while others hybridise with natives – think of the domestic cat hybridising with Scottish wildcats.  They can also impact on natives indirectly – the pathogen that causes ash dieback also affects insects, lichens, mosses and liverworts that rely on ash. Consequently, non-natives have been implicated in 58% of the 247 animal extinctions  where the cause is known. Humans are estimated to cause the establishment (deliberately or accidentally) of around ten non-native species in the UK each year. Although preventing establishment is preferential, the management of non-native species and reintroduction schemes have shown some success – for instance successful rat eradication on several islands has helped native seabirds. Clearly, the State of Nature report shows that conservation measures can benefit wildlife. However, as species are usually impacted by a combination of factors, a holistic approach is needed and what the report does not highlight is that unless there is a societal gain, there is often a lack of appetite to make progress.  Although public sector expenditure on biodiversity conservation in the UK has declined in the last decade, non-governmental expenditure has increased, indicating growing public concern. Indeed, the response to the plastic waste crisis demonstrates widespread appetite for a positive change – it is time to take drastic action."
"**Facebook is launching a campaign to help people spot fake news amid a growing advertising boycott putting pressure on the company to tackle misinformation and hate speech.**
Steve Hatch, Facebook's vice president for Northern Europe, says the media literacy campaign launched with fact-checkers FullFact is evidence that the company is ""listening and adapting"".
But some experts and critics argue the effort across the UK, Europe, Africa and the Middle East is ""too little, too late"".
The campaign will direct people to the website StampOutFalseNews.com and ask users key questions about what they see online: ""Where's it from?"" ""What's missing?"" and ""How did you feel?""
Seven ways to stop fake news from going viral
In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Mr Hatch says ""financial considerations"" are not behind the new ads.
In recent days, more than 150 companies - including Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Unilever - have announced temporary halts to advertising buys on Facebook as a result of the #StopHateForProfit campaign.
Misinformation or viral ""fake news"" has been a persistent issue for years on the social network, and it flared up dramatically after the emergence of Covid-19.
In May, a BBC investigation found links between coronavirus misinformation and assaults, arsons and deaths, with potential - and potentially much greater - indirect harm caused by rumours, conspiracy theories and bad health advice.
Mr Hatch says Facebook employees have working ""night and day"" to tackle false claims during the pandemic.
""If people were sharing information that could cause real-world harm, we will take that down. We've done that in hundreds of thousands of cases,"" he says.
But the media literacy effort is ""too little too late"" says Chloe Colliver, head of the digital research unit at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, an anti-extremism think tank.
""We've seen Facebook try to take reactive and often quite small steps to stem the tide of disinformation on the platform,"" Ms Colliver says. ""But they haven't been able to proactively produce policies that help prevent users from seeing disinformation, false identities, false accounts, and false popularity on their platforms."" Facebook also owns Instagram and WhatsApp.
Facebook and other social media companies have also come under pressure over misleading information or comments that could arguably incite violence, in particular posts by US President Donald Trump.
Following widespread protests after the death of George Floyd, the President warned: ""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""
The post was hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"", but remained on Facebook.
Mr Hatch says that the US president's posts ""come under a high level of scrutiny"" by Facebook bosses. Echoing earlier comments by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, he denied that the comment in question broke Facebook's rules, and stated that the company interpreted it as a reference to the possible use of National Guard troops.
""Whether you're a political figure or anyone on the platform,"" Mr Hatch says, you will be reprimanded for sharing posts that could cause real-world harm.
**Is there a story we should be investigating?**Email us."
"**Technology firm Fujitsu has said it will halve its office space in Japan as it adapts to the ""new normal"" of the coronavirus pandemic.**
It says the ""Work Life Shift"" programme will offer unprecedented flexibility to its 80,000 workers in the country.
Staff will be able to work flexible hours, and working from home will be standard wherever possible.
The announcement follows a similar move in May by social media platform Twitter.
In a statement sent to the BBC, Fujitsu said it ""will introduce a new way of working that promises a more empowering, productive, and creative experience for employees that will boost innovation and deliver new value to its customers and society"".
Under the plan employees will ""begin to primarily work on a remote basis to achieve a working style that allows them to flexibly use their time according to the contents of their work, business roles, and lifestyle"".
The company also said the programme would allow staff to choose where they worked, whether that was from home, a major corporate hub or a satellite office.
Fujitsu believes that that the increased autonomy offered to its workers will help to improve the performance of teams and increase productivity.
Sree Sreenivasan, visiting professor of digital innovation at the Stony Brook University School of Journalism, said the announcement underlined the huge long-term impact of the pandemic on the way many of us work.
""This is yet another sign that everything we know about offices and the future of work is being upended. Thousands of employers and millions of employees are learning the pros and cons of the new normal.""
""If they can combine the best of the pros (less commuting, more productivity, less expenses, etc), while minimising the cons (lack of in-person bonding, never being off the clock, etc), millions will be grateful, while frustrating thousands who preferred the old way of life,"" he added.
In May, Twitter told staff that they could work from home ""forever"" if they wished, as the company looks towards the future after the coronavirus pandemic.
The social media platform said: ""The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen.""
Earlier that month Google and Facebook said their staff could work from home until the end of the year.
Google originally said it would keep its work from home policy until 1 June, but extended it for seven more months.
Its announcement coincided with a similar move by social media giant Facebook."
"Just like us, the natural world dances to the rhythms of its seasonal cycles. We all enjoy the first suggestions of spring as trees come into leaf, migrant birds arrive, bees and butterflies emerge, and men in cities start wearing shorts.  These signs traditionally mark the start of a busy season of growth and reproduction for many species. But climate breakdown is altering the timing of many of the natural world’s seasonal cues. This is knocking different elements of the living planet out of sync with each other, with potentially disastrous consequences for ecosystems. Spring is arriving earlier throughout the world’s temperate and polar regions, but the species that live there are responding differently to the season’s advance. This happens because they use different cues, which respond to climate breakdown in different ways, if at all. For example, some species may react to the temperature reaching a minimum threshold or the melting of the last snow, cues that are happening earlier as global temperatures rise and unseasonable heatwaves become more common. However, others respond to day length, which is unaffected by climate breakdown. As the timings of age-old seasonal cues diverge with climate breakdown, some species are already starting to breed at different times relative to others they interact with, such as their prey. This can disrupt interactions that are critical to their life cycles. It’s a growing problem known as “phenological mismatch”. Take, for example, the birds of European oak woods, such as the blue tit, great tit and pied flycatcher. They all depend on caterpillars to feed their chicks, but the caterpillars are emerging earlier than they have in the past, and the birds are unable to keep up. For every ten-day advance in caterpillar emergence, the birds are only able to bring forward their egg laying by three to five days, depending on the species.  As a result, bird appetites are greatest after the period of peak caterpillar availability, and this reduces their reproductive success. In the Netherlands, this has caused pied flycatcher populations to crash by over 90%. Such mismatches may be most pronounced towards the poles, where temperatures are rising much faster than the global average. In the tundra of Greenland, the date on which insects are at their most abundant has been advancing by over a day a year since the mid 1990s. However, the hatching dates of the sanderling, a small shorebird, remain unchanged. The birds can’t breed earlier because that would increase the chance of losing their eggs to Arctic foxes. After two decades of unequal shifting in the food chain, the main banquet is already over when sanderling chicks are born, though more research is needed to understand how this is affecting their population. Mismatches aren’t limited to predator-prey interactions. They can also affect age-old partnerships between plants and their pollinators. The early spider-orchid vaguely resembles the female of the buffish mining bee and, like the closely related bee orchid, releases pheromones to trick the male bees into mating with it. In doing so, the bees inadvertently pollinate the flower. Orchid flowering is timed to coincide with the brief window between male and female bees emerging, so the males have nothing to mate with but flowers. But in warmer springs, the earlier emergence of females cuts this window, probably reducing the number of bees visiting and pollinating these orchids. Given the importance of insect pollination to agriculture and the functioning of ecosystems, the potential for such mismatches should be great cause for concern. Perhaps more worrying still, the impacts of these asynchronies are not confined to the species directly involved: they may cascade right through an ecosystem. For example, mismatches between birds and caterpillars may not only be bad for the birds. Now less likely to be hunted in their early lives, caterpillars can significantly reduce a tree’s foliage, and this could have knock-on effects for other insect herbivores that graze them, and in turn the animals that feed on these insects. Research on such ecosystem impacts is still in its infancy, but experiments in Alaska suggest that they could even contribute to climate feedbacks – processes that amplify global heating. There, the early return from migration of the Pacific black brant (a wild goose) means that the plants it feeds on lose more mass. While the change is good for the goose, it turns the ecosystem from a net absorber of carbon to a net emitter, exacerbating climate breakdown. There is much we still don’t understand about climate breakdown’s impacts on our fragile nature, and phenological mismatches are particularly complex to study. But what’s clear is that species and ecosystems, already weakened by habitat destruction, overharvesting, invasive species and pollution, face a major new threat. If we are to have any chance of preserving the living planet and avoiding the extinction of a million species, then we need to do more than stop climate breakdown. We need to invest in conservation too, to help wild plants and animals adapt to the changes we’ve already locked in. Not doing so would be bad news for all of us.

"**The US territory of Puerto Rico has declared a state of emergency as it braces for a tropical storm churning through the Caribbean.**
The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued hurricane watch and tropical storm warnings for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.
Forecasters now expect Tropical Storm Dorian to develop into a hurricane after making landfall in Puerto Rico.
President Donald Trump has approved an emergency declaration.
The move authorises US federal agencies to provide assistance and co-ordinate disaster relief.
By Wednesday morning, the storm was 290km (180 miles) south-east of Puerto Rico, approaching St Croix with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (96km/h), according to the NHC.
The NHC cautioned that tropical storm conditions are expected in Puerto Rico but hurricane conditions are also possible.
The centre said the storm may strengthen to a Category Two hurricane as it moves toward the east coast of Florida.
In Puerto Rico, a territory still recovering from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria in 2017, there are fears of power cuts and damage from strong winds.
Up to 15cm (6in) of rain could fall in Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, where swells along coastlines could cause ""life-threatening surf and rip current conditions"", forecasters have said.
The governor of Puerto Rico, Wanda VÃ¡zquez Garced, who declared the state of emergency for the US territory on Monday, has called on its more than three million citizens to prepare.
""I urge citizens to activate their emergency plan with caution and peace of mind,"" Ms VÃ¡zquez said on Twitter.
About 360 shelters would be open across the island, the governor said.
""Wow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico,"" President Donald Trump said in a tweet on Tuesday. ""Will it ever end?""
Though Mr Trump said Congress approved $92bn (Â£75bn) for the territory's recovery, lawmakers have only allocated around $42bn, which has yet to be fully spent. The White House says the higher figure is an estimate of how much money the island will need over two decades.
The storm is expected to pass south-west of Puerto Rico and eastern Hispaniola, possibly close to a Category 1 hurricane, on Wednesday night.
""Slow strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Dorian is forecast to be near hurricane strength when it moves close to Puerto Rico and eastern Hispaniola,"" the NHC said.
On Thursday, Dorian is forecast to make landfall in the Dominican Republic, before moving past the Turks and Caicos and south-eastern Bahamas on Friday.
According to the NHC's latest projections, the storm could make landfall in the US state of Florida late on Friday night or early Saturday morning.
Tropical storm warnings have been lifted for St Vincent and the Grenadines.
Puerto Rico is still vulnerable after Hurricane Maria ravaged the island in September 2017, killing an estimated 2,975 people and causing a humanitarian crisis.
A report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) suggested Maria had caused $90bn (Â£73bn) of damage in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.
Since Maria hit, Puerto Rico has struggled to repair its infrastructure and power grid, with Mr Trump signing a $19bn disaster relief bill for the island.
Ahead of Storm Dorian, Puerto Ricans have been alert to the dangers, stocking up on water, food and generators in preparation.
Zaida Garcia, a resident on the island, told ABC News that ""everybody's going bananas"" as the storm approaches.
""We can't afford another one, I'm telling you. We can't afford another one,"" she said.
In a statement, the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said, although Dorian is less severe than Maria, it could still ""have a significant impact""."

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Frederick Colbourne put Bangladesh and its woes in what I feel is a proper perspective. I’ve upgraded his comment to a post.
Once again it is a sad story that politicians are using computer-generated climate disasters of the far future as a cynical, lethal and obscenely expensive distraction of today’s real problems. The money flowing into the folly of “climate protection” would have been far better spent had it been invested where it was really needed. Worse it is distraction from the political failures of those calling for climate protection.
Comment by Frederick Colbourne:
Among journalists (and the public too) there is profound ignorance about the physical Earth. I recall from a beginning physical geography course that deltas subside and that also the great rivers gradually extend seaward by depositing silt and clay.
When I worked in Bangladesh last year on an urban development project last year, I found that other false claims are being made too: that offshore islands are being destroyed by climate change. However, the reality is that offshore islands drift with currents in the Gulf of Bengal.
So many myths about the Earth! There are even vestiges of the Garden of Eden myth: the belief that at some time in the past, the Earth was benign. Nature is neither benign nor malevolent.
Nature is indifferent to the affairs of Man. The geographical disadvantages of eastern Bengal are ancient but made worse by growth of population to over 100 million people in a land that has few resources apart from land and rivers. These rivers flood about 40% of the land each year.
Religious and political conflicts led to partition of British India 65 years ago. Since then Bangladeshis have suffered a war of independence and military rule, either overt or behind the scenes. Bangladesh is one of the worst-governed countries in the world.
Climate change is the least of Bangladesh’s worries.”

From the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and the department of unverifiable forecasts in our lifetime comes this model based projection.
Researchers say Ross Sea will reverse current trend, be largely ice free in summer by 2100
Antarctica’s Ross Sea is one of the few polar regions where summer sea-ice coverage has increased during the last few decades, bucking a global trend of drastic declines in summer sea ice across the Arctic Ocean and in two adjacent embayments of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica.
Now, a modeling study led by Professor Walker Smith of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science suggests that the Ross Sea’s recent observed increase in summer sea-ice cover is likely short-lived, with the area projected to lose more than half its summer sea ice by 2050 and more than three quarters by 2100.  
These changes, says Smith, will significantly impact marine life in what is one of the world’s most productive and unspoiled marine ecosystems, where rich blooms of phytoplankton feed krill, fish, and higher predators such as whales, penguins, and seals.

VIMS professor Walker Smith in Antarctica.
Smith, who has been conducting ship-based fieldwork in the Ross Sea since the 1980s, collaborated on the study with colleagues at Old Dominion University. Their paper, “The effects of changing winds and temperatures on the oceanography of the Ross Sea in the 21st century,” appears in the Feb. 26 issue of Geophysical Research Letters. Smith’s co-authors are Mike Dinniman, Eileen Hofmann, and John Klinck.
Smith says “The Ross Sea is critically important in regulating the production of Antarctica’s sea ice overall and is biologically very productive, which makes changes in its physical environment of global concern. Our study predicts that it will soon reverse its present trend and experience major drops in ice cover in summer, which, along with decreased mixing of the vertical column, will extend the season of phytoplankton growth. These changes will substantially alter the area’s pristine food web.”
Researchers attribute the observed increase in summertime sea ice in the Ross Sea—where the number of days with ice cover has grown by more two months over the past three decades—to a complex interplay of factors, including changes in wind speed, precipitation, salinity, ocean currents, and air and water temperature.

But global climate models agree that air temperatures in Antarctica will increase substantially in the coming decades, with corresponding changes in the speed and direction of winds and ocean currents. When Smith and his colleagues fed these global projections into a high-resolution computer model of air-sea-ice dynamics in the Ross Sea, they saw a drastic reduction in the extent and duration of summer sea ice.
The modeled summer sea ice concentrations decreased by 56% by 2050 and 78% by 2100. The ice-free season also grew much longer, with the mean day of retreat in 2100 occurring 11 days earlier and the advance occurring 16 days later than now.
Also changed was the duration and depth of the “shallow mixed layer,” the zone where most phytoplankton live. “Our model projects that the shallow mixed layer will persist for about a week longer in 2050, and almost three weeks longer in 2100 than now,” says Smith. “The depth of the shallow mixed layer will also decrease significantly, with its bottom 12% shallower in 2050, and 44% shallower in 2100 than now.”

The extent and duration of ice cover in the Ross Sea depends on a complex interplay of factors, including changes in wind speed, precipitation, salinity, ocean currents, and air and water temperature.
For Smith, these changes in ice, atmosphere, and ocean dynamics portend major changes in the Antarctic food web. On the bright side, the decrease in ice cover will bring more light to surface waters, while a more persistent and shallower mixed layer will concentrate phytoplankton and nutrients in this sunlit zone. These changes will combine to encourage phytoplankton growth, particularly for single-celled organisms called diatoms, with ripples of added energy potentially moving up the food web.
But, Smith warns, the drop in ice cover will negatively affect several other important species that are ice-dependent, including crystal krill and Antarctic silverfish. A decrease in krill would be particularly troublesome, as these are the major food source for the Ross Sea’s top predators—minke whales, Adélie and Emperor penguins, and crabeater seals.
Overall, says Smith, “our results suggest that phytoplankton production will increase and become more diatomaceous. Other components of the Ross Sea food web will likely be severely disrupted, creating significant but unpredictable impacts on the ocean’s most pristine ecosystem.”

The 21st century is supposed to be a time of liberal enlightenment. But the reality looks very different. Instead of a world of mutual understanding and tolerance, people around the globe face spreading violence and human rights abuses. Religious persecution continues to rise.



The latest report from the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom documents the worst manifestations of this attack on the most basic liberty of conscience. Now in its 15th year, the Commission reflected on the importance of religious freedom, which “means the right of all human beings to think as they please, believe or not believe as their conscience leads, and live out their beliefs openly, peacefully, and without fear.”





Countless nations still trample religious liberty.



The issues ultimately are not abstract and theoretical, but real and practical. Observed the USCIRF: “When religious freedom is abridged, real people—as well as their families, communities, and countries—pay a price.” People are murdered, worshipers are imprisoned, girls are kidnapped, homes are destroyed, businesses are ruined, and much more because some employ power or violence against those who believe differently.



More broadly, religious persecution operates as the proverbial canary in the mine, indicating the existence of intolerance and hatred which are incubators for violence that can undermine entire societies and spawn terrorist attacks even beyond national borders. Governments that are unwilling or unable to protect the liberty to act on the deepest held beliefs about one’s creator are unlikely to safeguard other freedoms of conscience. To betray religious liberty, explained the Commission, “is to betray human nature and well‐​being; to affirm it is to affirm our very humanity and its thriving.” Unfortunately, a shocking number of nations care little about human nature and even less about human thriving.



Dozens of countries abuse religious liberty. The USCIRF concentrates on the 26 worst. Sixteen are Tier 1 “Countries of Particular Concern,” which means “any country whose government engages in or tolerates particularly severe violations of religious freedom that are systematic, ongoing and egregious.”



 **Burma.** The country is changing politically, though it remains far from a functioning democracy that respects the rule of law and protects civil liberties. Unfortunately, recent reforms “have not improved legal protections for religious freedom and have done little to curtain anti‐​Muslim violence, incitement and discrimination,” particularly targeting the Rohingya Muslim minority. There also was violence and discrimination against ethnic Kamans, who are Muslims, and “ethnic minority Christians faced serious abuses during recent military incursions in Kachin State.”



 **China.** This communist giant has not reformed politically. Moreover, “the Chinese government continues to perpetrate particularly severe violations of religious freedom. For Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims, conditions are worse now than at any time in the past decade. Independent Catholics and Protestants face arrests, fines, and the shuttering of their places of worship. Practitioners of Falun Gong, as well as other Buddhist, folk, religions, and Protestant groups deemed ‘superstitious” or “evil cults,” face long jail terms, forced renunciations of faith, and torture in detention.”



 **Egypt.** Christians are suffering in the midst of Egypt’s turmoil. There were some improvements after the fall of Hosni Mubarak, but “the Morsi‐​era government and the interim government failed or were slow to protect religious minorities, particularly Coptic Orthodox Christians, from violence.” Moreover, despite the military’s faux return to democracy, “discriminatory and repressive laws and policies that restrict freedom of thought, conscience, and religion or belief remain in place.” In fact, Egypt is one of several nations which imprison their citizens for “blasphemy,” a charge often used against religious minorities.



 **Eritrea.** Called the North Korea of Africa, Eritrea is one of the world’s most repressive states. The regime’s totalitarian nature leads to widespread religious persecution. “Systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations continue in Eritrea,” which “include torture or other ill‐​treatment of religious prisoners, arbitrary arrests and detentions without charges, a prolonged ban on public religious activities, and interference in the internal affairs of registered religious groups. The religious freedom situation is particularly grave for Evangelical and Pentecostal Christians and Jehovah’s Witnesses.”



 **Iran.** Change may be afoot in Iran, but if so it has yet to benefit non‐​Shia Muslims. During last year’s presidential election “the already‐​poor religious freedom conditions in Iran continued to deteriorate, particularly for religious minorities, especially Baha’is and Christian converts. Sufi and Sunni Muslims and dissenting Shi’a Muslims also faced harassment, arrests, and imprisonment. The government of Iran continues to engage in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom, including prolonged detention, torture, and executions based primarily or entirely upon the religion of the accused.”



 **Iraq.** Saddam Hussein was a notably brutal thug, but cared little about religion and elevated a nominal Christian to top positions in his government. Today religious minorities are targets of widespread violence. “In the past year the government failed to stem egregious and increasing violence by non‐​state actors against Iraqi civilians, including attacks targeting religious pilgrims and worshippers, religious sites, and leaders, as well as individuals for their actual or assumed religious identity.” The country’s slide back towards Shi’a-Sunni conflict further threatens all religious minorities.



 **Nigeria.** In this African state sharply divided between Muslims and Christians, I saw mosques give way to churches as I traveled south during a recent trip. “Nigeria’s democracy is being tested by recurring sectarian violence, attacks and threats against Christians by Boko Haram, and the misuse of religion by politicians, religious leaders, and others.” Although the government itself does not persecute, “it tolerates severe violations through its failure to bring to justice those responsible for systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations, or to prevent or contain sectarian violence.”



 **North Korea.** The world’s most oppressive dictatorship is in its third generation of monarchical communism. “Individuals engaged in clandestine religious activity are arrested, tortured, imprisoned, and sometimes executed. Thousands of religious believers and their families are imprisoned in penal labor camps, including refugees repatriated from China.” There may be no worse persecutor on earth.



 **Pakistan.** Although nominally both an ally and a democracy, Pakistan is no friend of religious freedom. “In the past year, conditions hit an all‐​time low due to chronic sectarian violence targeting mostly Shi’a Muslims but also Christians, Ahmadis, and Hindus.” The government did little to halt the attacks. Moreover, “Pakistan’s repressive blasphemy laws and anti‐​Ahmadi laws are widely used to violate religious freedoms and foster a climate of impunity.”



 **Saudi Arabia.** An ally but undemocratic, Saudi Arabia is essentially totalitarian. This country “remains unique in the extent to which it restricts the public expression of any religion other than Islam. Not a single church or other non‐​Muslim house of worship exists in the country.” Moreover, the government “has arrested individuals for dissent, apostasy, blasphemy, and sorcery.” By underwriting extremist Islamic educational materials worldwide, the Saudi royal family also has helped foster the kind of hatred which has fueled terrorist violence elsewhere.



 **Sudan.** Although the secession of South Sudan ended the long‐​running and murderous conflict in which religion played a role, Sudan’s government “continues to engage in systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of freedom of religion or belief. It imposes a restrictive interpretation of Shari’ah law on Muslims and non‐​Muslims alike, using amputations and floggings for crimes and acts of ‘indecency’ and ‘immorality’ and arresting Christians for proselytizing.” Violence also is a problem. “Governmental and non‐​governmental attacks on the Christian community also continue.”



 **Syria.** Although the Assad dictatorship always was ruthless, it also always was nonsectarian. In fact, the country became a refuge for Christians escaping Iraq. In the midst of civil war, however, the regime battles Sunni Muslims, while extremist opponents “target religious minority communities, including Christians and Alawites, because of their faith, and internationally‐​recognized opposition military groups have committed religious freedom violations when working with other groups to secure strategic areas.”



 **Tajikistan.** Central Asia is one of the worst areas for religious liberty. In Tajikistan “the government suppresses and punishes all religious activity independent of state control, particularly the activities of Muslims, Protestants, and Jehovah’s Witnesses. The government also imprisons individuals on unproven criminal allegations linked to Islamic religious activity and affiliation.”



 **Turkmenistan.** This former Soviet republic hosts “particularly severe religious freedom violations.” Despite some recent improvements, “the country’s laws, policies, and practices violate international human rights norms, including those on freedom of religion or belief. Police raids and harassment of registered and unregistered religious groups continue.”



 **Uzbekistan.** Like its neighbors, Uzbekistan suppresses political and religious liberty alike. The authorities impose “a highly restrictive religion law and harsh penalties on all independent religious activity. The government also imprisons individuals who do not conform to officially‐​prescribed practices or who it claims are extremist.”



 **Vietnam.** America’s old antagonist is looking to America as an ally against China and has liberalized economically. However, “despite some positive changes over the past decade, the Vietnamese government continues to imprison individuals for religious activity or religious freedom advocacy. It uses a specialized religious police force and vague national security laws to suppress independent Buddhist, Protestant, Hoa Hao, and Cao Dai activities, and seeks to stop the growth of ethnic minority Protestantism and Catholicism via discrimination, violence, and forced renunciations of their faith.”



Another ten countries are Tier 2—almost CPCs—where there are “serious” violations and “at least one of the elements of the ‘systematic, ongoing, and egregious’ standard” is present. These states look good only in comparison to those in Tier 1.



 **Afghanistan** , supported by U.S. force of arms, refused to protect religious freedom for “dissenting Sunni Muslims, as well as Shi’a Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Bahai’s.” **Azerbaijan** has been moving backwards: “Registration requests from religious organizations have been delayed or denied, religious groups closed, and in the past year non‐​violent religious activists have been detained, fined, and imprisoned.” In **Cuba** there was “harassment of religious leaders and laity, interference in religious groups’ internal affairs, and pressure to prevent democracy and human rights activists from participating in religious activities.”



Although nominally a secular democracy, **India** “has struggled to protect minority communities or provide justice when crimes occur,” most notably “communal and religiously‐​motivated violence.” In **Indonesia** tolerance has given way with “the detentions of individuals considered religiously ‘deviant’ and the ongoing intimidation, discrimination, and violence against religious minorities, including Ahmadis, Christians, Shi’a, Sufis, Hindus, Baha’is, and followers of indigenous religions.” Central Asia’s **Kazakhstan** “bans unregistered religious activity and has been enforced through the closing of religious organizations, police raids, detentions, and fines.”



 **Laos** is a communist relic in which “serious religious freedom abuses continue, particularly in ethnic minority areas, and restrictive laws remain in place.” In **Malaysia** there are “inadequate legal protections for religious minorities and ethnic Malays who wish to change their religion, bans on certain publications and groups considered religiously ‘deviant,’ including Shi’a, and expanded efforts to arrest and harass members of such groups.” **Russia** has seen a deterioration in human rights generally, and “the anti‐​extremism law was used against religious individuals and groups, particularly Jehovah’s Witnesses and Muslim readers of Turkish theologian Said Nursi,” while the blasphemy law “further curtailed the freedoms of religion, belief, and expression.” Although the Erdogan government has relaxed state interference with religious liberty in **Turkey** , aspects of the country’s past policy of ruthless secularism live on, leading “to governmental interference and restrictions that hinder full religious freedom,” especially for religious minorities.



These are merely the worst, and not the only, violators of religious liberty. The Commission also is monitoring Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, and even countries in Europe. Religious believers may at times feel under siege in the U.S., but they are not persecuted. In contrast, real persecution exists in many countries overseas.



Sadly, there is little outsiders can do in many of these cases. The USCIRF proposed that Washington demonstrate a stronger commitment to the issue, and any dialogue over human rights should include the status of religious liberty. However, even in the best of circumstances the government always will balance efforts to promote religious liberty with attempts to achieve important economic, political, and security ends. Moreover, there always will be limits to what changes outsiders can force in other nations. Americans would not react well to foreign attempts to transform U.S. policy and society.



Still, there’s no reason for the American people to wait for their government to act. Individuals should write letters to persecuting governments, protest officials and organizations of unfree states, and complain to business leaders and others from countries which limit religious liberty. Americans should urge the U.S. government to accept religious refugees and open their own homes to those who escape foreign oppression. Believers should press their churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious communities to advocate on behalf of the freedom of all to practice their faiths. And those of us who enjoy America’s bountiful liberties at home should support organizations seeking to spread those freedoms abroad.



Freedom of conscience is the bedrock foundation for all liberties. Unfortunately, this most basic human right is widely violated around the globe. Americans should advocate for religious liberty for all.

"Just minutes after a federal judge blocked part of President Trump’s immigration order on Saturday night, ruling that no one with a valid visa should be deported, someone was, according to court papers filed on Thursday. Her name is Suha Amin Abdullah Abushamma, a Sudanese doctor with a valid     visa who was working at the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, in a residency program. “She left for vacation thinking she’d be gone for a short time, and then she couldn’t come back to her home,” Dr. Abushamma’s lawyer, Jennifer Kroman, said on Thursday evening. “It raises not only constitutional questions, but questions about the importance of court orders. ” Mr. Trump said his immigration order, restricting entry to the United States by people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Sudan, was intended to make the country safe from Islamic terrorists. But according to lawyers for immigrants who were barred, the order caught in its web dozens of people like Dr. Abushamma, who graduated at the top of her class from medical school. Dr. Abushamma’s case was highlighted at a hearing in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Thursday, where Judge Carol B. Amon extended until Feb. 21 the initial ruling  —   formally known as a stay of removal  —   issued last week by her colleague, Judge Ann M. Donnelly. Judge Amon will be presiding over the case and deciding on the legal issues underlying the executive order, while at the same time overseeing nine cases in which plaintiffs say they were improperly deported. The Thursday hearing before Judge Amon was largely procedural and was held to set out the schedule for arguments and motions in coming weeks. But in a separate action the day before, Judge Amon ordered the government to explain in writing by   why she should not allow Dr. Abushamma to return to the United States, where the doctor is engaged to be married to a fellow physician. Lawyers for the plaintiffs described Dr. Abushamma’s detention and deportation during Thursday’s hearing. Four days before Mr. Trump signed the executive order, Dr. Abushamma had flown to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia to spend time with her family. Her apartment, her car and all of her belongings  —   save the few that she had packed for her vacation  —   were still in Cleveland. But when she landed at Kennedy Airport on Jan. 28, she was detained by customs agents and not allowed to continue on to Cleveland, according to the papers filed on Thursday. Dr. Abushamma, the papers said, was held for more than six hours at the airport, as arguments were being held in Judge Donnelly’s courtroom. And although her immigration lawyer tried to explain to customs agents that the judge was about to rule, the lawyer was ignored, the papers said. She was escorted onto a plane headed back to Saudi Arabia by two customs officials. “One stood in front of her and the other stood behind her,” according to the papers. “Dr. Abushamma felt like they were trying to make sure that she did not escape, as though she was a criminal in custody. ” In court, lawyers for the immigrants said it remained unclear if people were removed from the country in violation of Judge Donnelly’s ruling, as Dr. Abushamma contends she was, and how many of them there might be. Though lawyers say they have repeatedly asked the government for a detailed list of those who were both detained and deported since the ruling went into effect, federal officials have not yet provided one. The government has said that no immigrants are currently in custody, but lawyers say that could be because some of them have already been improperly sent back to their homelands. “It is unlikely we have found the entire universe of people who have been removed,” said Lee Gelernt, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, who argued for the immigrants at the hearing. Mr. Gelernt said that he would give the government another chance to furnish him with a list of detainees and those who were deported, but he added that if federal officials did not provide the list within “a short time”  —   perhaps as early as Friday  —   he would consider filing a contempt of court complaint against the administration. The case may emerge as the first of its kind to decide whether the Trump administration disobeyed Judge Donnelly’s ruling to keep legal visa holders in the country. Samuel Go, a lawyer for the Justice Department, said at the hearing that the government planned to file a motion to dismiss the entire case challenging Mr. Trump’s executive order, which, so far, has not been subject to a ruling on broad constitutional grounds. While Mr. Gelernt and his colleagues have opposed the order, saying that it violates due process rights and discriminates against Muslims in contravention of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, they have not yet had the opportunity to make those arguments in court. Given that most of the travelers detained by the government have already been released, possibly rendering their legal efforts moot, Dr. Abushamma’s claims may provide the plaintiffs with an opportunity to attack the basic legal foundations of the executive order. “When she left to visit her family, she had no idea that she would become ensnared in the chaos following President Trump’s issuance of an unconstitutional and unlawful Executive Order,” her papers say. “Nor did Dr. Abushamma ever imagine then that, as a valid   living and working legally in the United States, she would be barred from reentry to the United States and unlawfully removed to Saudi Arabia. ”"

“…societal change is sufficient to explain the increasing costs of disasters at the global level…”
We often hear of the wailing by climate activists and in the MSM about the huge cost numbers related to weather disasters, as if somehow these numbers are indicative of a trend linkable with ‘climate change’. For example, USA Today’s Doyle Rice reported in 2012 this headline:
Report: Climate change behind rise in weather disasters
The number of natural disasters per year has been rising dramatically on all continents since 1980, but the trend is steepest for North America where countries have been battered by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, searing heat and drought, a new report says.

The study being released today by Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurance firm, sees climate change driving the increase and predicts those influences will continue in years ahead, though a number of experts question that conclusion.
…
Atmospheric scientist Clifford Mass of the University of Washington also has a problem with Munich Re’s findings, saying that once the data are adjusted for population there is no recent upward trend in tornado or hurricane damages. Also, he adds that there is no evidence that global warming is causing more extreme weather in the USA.
Of course, any time an insurance company dabbles in science related to losses, you can be sure there’s a motivation other than pure science behind it. Shalini Mohleji and Roger Pielke Jr. thought this was worth examining to see if it such claims held up, and it turns out, they don’t.
The new paper:
Reconciliation of Trends in Global and Regional Economic Losses from Weather Events: 1980–2008

Shalini Mohleji and Roger Pielke Jr.


In recent years claims have been made in venues including the authoritative reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and in testimony before the US Congress that economic losses from weather events have been increasing beyond that which can be explained by societal change, based on loss data from the reinsurance industry and aggregated since 1980 at the global level. Such claims imply a contradiction with a large set of peer-reviewed studies focused on regional losses, typically over a much longer time period, which concludes that loss trends are explained entirely by societal change. To address this implied mismatch, we disaggregate global losses from a widely utilized reinsurance dataset into regional components and compare this disaggregation directly to the findings from the literature at the regional scale, most of which reach back much further in time. We find that global losses increased at a rate of $3.1 billion/year (2008 USD) from 1980–2008 and losses from North American, Asian, European, and Australian storms and floods account for 97% of the increase. In particular, North American storms, of which U.S. hurricane losses compose the bulk, account for 57% of global economic losses. Longer-term loss trends in these regions can be explained entirely by socioeconomic factors in each region such as increasing wealth, population growth, and increasing development in vulnerable areas. The remaining 3% of the global increase 1980 to 2008 is the result of losses for which regionally based studies have not yet been completed. On climate time scales, societal change is sufficient to explain the increasing costs of disasters at the global level and claims to the contrary are not supported by aggregate loss data from the reinsurance industry.

OPINION By Craig D. Idso, Ph.D.
In his State of the Union address, President Obama advocated an energy policy aimed at reducing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which he claims are causing catastrophic changes to the earth’s climate and “harming western communities.”  In his policy prescription, the president advocates a combination of increased regulation of the energy and transportation industries and more government spending on research designed to bring low-carbon-emitting sources of energy, i.e., so-called renewables, to market. He considers those actions to be the only viable options “leading to a cleaner, safer planet.”
But the president’s concerns for the planet are based upon flawed and speculative science; and his policy prescription is a recipe for failure.

With respect to the science, Obama conveniently fails to disclose the fact that literally thousands of scientific studies have produced findings that run counter to his view of future climate. As just one example, and a damning one at that, all of the computer models upon which his vision is based failed to predict the current plateau in global temperature that has continued for the past 16 years.  That the earth has not warmed significantly during this period, despite an 8 percent increase in atmospheric CO2, is a major indictment of the models’ credibility in predicting future climate, as well as the president’s assertion that debate on this topic is “settled.”
Numerous other problems with Obama’s model-based view of future climate have been filling up the pages of peer-reviewed science journals for many years now, as evidenced by the recent work of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change, which published a 1,000-page report in September highlighting a large and well-substantiated alternative viewpoint that contends that rising atmospheric CO2 emissions will have a much smaller, if not negligible, impact on future climate, while generating several biospheric benefits.
Concerning these benefits, atmospheric CO2 is the building block of plant life.  It is used by earth’s plants in the process of photosynthesis to construct their tissues and grow.  And as has been conclusively demonstrated in numerous scientific studies, the more CO2 we put into the air, the better plants grow.  Among other findings, they produce greater amounts of biomass, become more efficient at using water, and are better able to cope with environmental stresses such as pollution and high temperatures.
The implications of these benefits are enormous.  One recent study calculated that over the 50-year period ending in 2001, the direct monetary benefits conferred by the atmospheric CO2 enrichment of the Industrial Revolution on global crop production amounted to a staggering $3.2 trillion. And projecting this positive externality forward in time reveals it will likely bestow an additional $9.8 trillion in crop production benefits between now and 2050.
By ignoring these realities, Obama’s policy prescription is found to be erroneous.  The taxation or regulation of CO2 emissions is an unnecessary and detrimental policy option that should be shunned.  Why would any government advocate to increase regulations and raise energy prices based on flawed computer model projections of climate change that will never come to pass?  Why would any government advance policy that seeks to destroy jobs, rather than to promote them?  Why, in fact, would they actually “bite the hand that feeds them?”
We live in a time when half the global population experiences some sort of limitation in their access to energy, energy that is needed for the most basic of human needs, including the production of clean water, warmth, and light.  One-third of those thus impacted are children.  An even greater portion finds its ranks among the poor.
As a society, it is time to recognize and embrace the truth.  Carbon dioxide is not a pollutant.  Its increasing concentration only minimally affects earth’s climate, while it offers tremendous benefits to the biosphere.  Efforts to regulate and reduce CO2 emissions will hurt far more than they will help.

 _ **In a few sentences describe who you are, and who the New Conservatives are?**_



For myself, I’ve spent nearly twenty years with at-risk youth and families, in personal then professional life, and am a husband with two little punks who I adore.  
For us, we are Kiwis who are at the coalface of various industries and fields, who have seen the gradual breakdown of family, freedom and our future and have chosen to stand and fight to retain the priceless values that are being replaced in our current time.



 _ **Why should people vote for the New Conservatives?**_



We defend the values of our culture as there is no other party who do so as a party – we stand unashamedly for the objectively high value of life from womb to tomb, a strong family and strong marriages, reward for effort, patriotism, the honouring of both pillars of society, respect, equality and justice.  
No other party stands for what we stand for.



 _ **Some say a vote for any small party such as NC might be a wasted vote, what do you say to them?**_



Vote for a party you don’t really believe in, whether for pragmatism or fear, and that will be a wasted vote.  
Voting for your values is never a wasted vote. 



_**Which side of the political spectrum do NC lean toward and why?**_



The Left-Right spectrum would likely see us Centre/Centre Right.  
More specifically we are conservatives, which Mary Matalin describes well:  
 _“Conservatism vests in and depends on the widespread, informed understanding of human nature, self-governance and the First Principle of Progress: free people interacting in free markets produce the greatest good for the greatest number always, but only, when tethered to virtue and morality”._  
 _ **  
**_ **Will you be standing in an electorate and if so, which one?**



I will stand for Botany. **  
  
We all know that small parties in a coalition struggle to get much across the line, but what will be the first two policies that you will be pushing hard for, should you make it to parliament?**



Depends on what strength we have; for myself I really want to return power to the New Zealand people via BCIR [Binding Citizens Initiated Referenda]- there is no system lever (beyond the Commonwealth linked one that will not be used) that keeps this government in check, especially regarding the continuing expansion of state control over our lives.  
BCIR is the only policy that does this, and we are the only party who fight for this. **  
  
Do NC have any “bottom lines” that you will not be swayed from?**



“Bottom lines” is a sales pitch technique; a promise in the ears that gives the illusion of strength and trust in the salesperson, for example:  
 _“you won’t be talking to NZ First unless you want a referendum on both those issues at the mid-term mark of this election.”_ …cough.  
Who we are and what we stand for is more transparent and written clearly than any other.  
The more the votes, the more strength we have.  
 **  
Can you see New Conservatives working with all parties or will you be ruling any out?**  
 **  
**No…well, technically, we could work with any party, but to me, it makes no sense why we would work with those who push for socialism, state dependency, the breaking of family, unequal treatment and the like.  
A running joke is that we would work with the Greens…if they removed 98% of their policies.



 **Do you believe that Man Made Climate Change is one of the most important issues NZ is currently facing?**



Not by a long shot, and the billions being extracted from our nation’s economy to be sent to the economy of a foreign corporation for that reason is offensive.



 **You have worked with disadvantaged and wayward youth out at the coalface. What do you personally see as the most important thing that we as a nation could do to for our young people?**



Repair the damage politicians and the Left have done to the family structure and marriage.  
Leave it alone.  
Two quick sentences that do require explanation, but that takes a bit of time.



 **Many readers of our site hold concerns about what influence Colin Craig may still have on your re-branded party. Are you able to advise if CC is a member of, or donates to New Conservatives and if he still has any influence within the new party?**



Haven’t seen or heard from that guy in years (except for the news) – it was right that he fell on his sword, honour for that – we have to walk that talk; I hope his family are OK.   
No donation, influence, membership or whatever. **  
  
I see there is quite a lot of information about NC’s policies etc on your website** [newconservative.org.nz](https://www.newconservative.org.nz/), **are there any policies in particular that you would like to highlight for _The BFD_ readers?**



I really love the 3 stage sentencing actually:  
Work, Education, then Open, but with the kicker that if you don’t engage, you don’t get out, simple. That way we seek to help rehabilitation, but if someone wants to go ‘nah get stuffed’, then no exit.  
I have always loved that one…



 **Where do you see both yourself and the New Conservatives in ten years time?**



With a proud legacy that we returned values to New Zealand, and successfully defended her people from the Socialist/Marxist ideologies that are currently spreading throughout our culture.  
Strong families, strong marriages, strong values, known worldwide, as we once were. **  
  
Thank you for your time today and for your efforts on the Nation’s stage. Is there anything else you would like to add by way of a final comment?**



There are several quotes that I carry in my mind; one that I have both succeeded and failed at in my life is the most important in today’s political environment:  
 _‘The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing’._

"If we lived in normal political times, our new president would be enjoying his honeymoon period, those few blissful weeks of good will and high hopes that usually accompany the start of an administration. Instead, the election of Donald J. Trump to the nation’s highest office has provoked an opposition movement that is extraordinary in American history, with millions of people devoted to stopping whatever it is he might want to do. The declarations began early on, with one key word echoing across them. “We are going to resist, we are going to oppose,” the filmmaker Michael Moore announced on the Friday after Trump’s election. “This is going to be a massive resistance. ” The following week, the former MSNBC host Keith Olbermann began a new video series titled “The Resistance. ” In December, a group of former Democratic congressional staff members published a   pamphlet titled “Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda,” calling on liberals and leftists to emulate the most effective tactics of the Tea Party. On Twitter, hashtags like #ResistTrump, #NewAmericanResistance and #TheResistance document the range of concerns and movements now assembling under one banner: climate change, net neutrality, Black Lives Matter, reproductive and immigrant and disability rights. The   Women’s March made all of this spectacularly visible, with a   show of defiance intended to put the president on notice. “Today is not a concert,” the march organizer Tamika Mallory told the crowd gathered in Washington. “It is not a parade. And it is not a party. Today is an act of resistance. ” Days later, activists unfurled a   banner from a crane behind the White House, with just one word printed on it: RESIST. As the term of choice for the emerging   coalition, “resistance” signals urgency, the desire to stand up and say no before it’s too late. At the same time, it concedes some ground: With Republicans controlling all three branches of government, “no” may be the only position available to Democrats, leftists and liberals. To resist is to do something negative  —   to push back against someone else’s agenda when your own back is up against the wall. It is a desperate word for desperate times, filled with limits as well as possibilities. A call to resist is different from a call to “organize” or  —   to borrow a word from the   Age of Obama  —   to “dream. ” Those words conjure visions of better worlds. Resistance names what you don’t want and leaves the vision thing for another, less urgent situation. It suggests a notably dark story about the next four years, one in which Democrats and liberals spend most of their time in a defensive crouch. Resistance evokes the struggle against totalitarianism, conveying personal defiance and official powerlessness at the same time. So what does it mean to apply that word in an ostensibly democratic system? If you’ve lost at the ballot box but aren’t seeking   revolution, what are the most useful forms of political action? If “yes” seems impossible but “no” seems insufficient, what fills the space between? Before Trump’s election, anyone who claimed to have been a member of “the resistance” was most likely over the age of 85, a veteran of   struggles in France and other   territories during World War II. That resistance involved armed conflict and personal risk of the bleakest sort, with guerrilla fighters hiding in the catacombs of Paris while Hitler’s forces did their worst above ground. Under fascist rule, there were no plausible options for political engagement. It was a fight to the death, and in early 1940s Europe, before the arrival of Allied troops, the outcome was far from certain. Talking about resistance still evokes this sense of honorable struggle against an occupying power. It implies patience as well as militancy, the ability to say no over and over and over again, to refuse to cooperate until the whole system crumbles. After the war, anticolonial movements from South Africa to Northern Ireland found their own strategies of resistance, settling in for long, sometimes bloody fights. The United States introduced its own peculiar twist on this idea, transforming a rallying cry of   liberation into a defense of white supremacy. In 1954, after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, white Southerners opted for “massive resistance”  —   a phrase coined by former Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia to describe the determined and bitter campaign to prevent the desegregation of Southern society. “Massive resistance” defended the racial status quo, but it adopted the language of rebellion, casting the federal government itself as an illegitimate occupying power. The American left created a different language of resistance, much of it focused around the   activities of groups like the War Resisters League. This   sensibility reached its peak in the late 1960s, during the Vietnam War, when student activists proclaimed a transition, per one slogan, “from Protest to Resistance. ” As the movement veterans Staughton Lynd and Michael Ferber pointed out in their 1971 book, “The Resistance,” that shift grew out of a desire to embrace “a deeper and riskier commitment, a move that warranted a new term to replace ‘dissent’ and ‘protest. ’’u2009” The goal was no longer simply to object to the war it was to throw a wrench into the war machine and make it stop. Antiwar activists continued to engage in peaceful protest  —   but now some also burned draft cards and firebombed R. O. T. C. centers. A small number, like the Weathermen, took up bona fide guerrilla activity, planting bombs at the Capitol, the Pentagon and other prominent buildings. As the war and its    stakes came to an end, so, too, did the embrace of resistance as a literal armed underground conspiracy. But while it faded as a political strategy, it began to gain prominence as a category of academic social analysis, the sort of thing that anthropologists and historians looked for in their studies of human societies. This was part of a broader trend toward “social history,” with its insistence that ordinary people  —   not just generals and politicians  —   could be the agents of serious historical change. Sometimes this meant studying organized revolts, like slave rebellions or peasant uprisings. By the 1980s, though, “resistance” had come to encompass a much broader set of behaviors. Enslaved or oppressed people might resist by taking up arms, but they might also resist simply by refusing to do as they were told. The political theorist James Scott called these “everyday forms of resistance”  —   a category that could include giving a sullen look to an employer, deliberately misfiling forms or just living life, as much as possible, on terms of your own choosing. Today’s “New American Resistance” seems to embrace at least some of this broader understanding. Joining it does not, thus far, require adherence to any particular ideology or set of tactical preferences. It simply means, in the biggest of   formulations, that you really don’t like Donald Trump, and you’re willing to do something about it. As a   enterprise, designed to achieve the greatest possible participation, this mode of resistance makes sense. But despite its good cheer, it still emphasizes what is not possible: It says that Trump is about to take a sledgehammer to the nation’s finest institutions and principles and that the only thing most citizens can do is shout “no” as loudly as possible. Many organizers have vowed that this yawp of dissent represents a beginning rather than an end  —   and history suggests that they may well be right. Some of the most significant shifts in modern American law and political culture came out of efforts birthed in panic and despair. During World War I, for instance, the United States banned criticism of the government, interned thousands of German Americans and instituted widespread surveillance of immigrants and political radicals. Many Americans supported these policies others feared that the country was abandoning cherished traditions of tolerance and free speech. In response, a small group of alarmed progressives founded an organization that came to be known as the American Civil Liberties Union. They lost many early courtroom battles, but their vision of a nation in which “civil liberties” were taken seriously eventually changed the face of American law and politics. There are conservative versions of this story, too. In the   at a moment when the   liberal consensus seemed to be at its height, William F. Buckley Jr. announced plans to “stand athwart history, yelling ‘Stop! ’’u2009” His new magazine, National Review, did not stop history, but it did provide a crucial platform for conservatives to think about where they wanted history to go. The budding movement set its sights on taking over the Republican Party and spent decades making that happen  —   turning resistance into concrete political success. Today even Buckley’s form of conservatism seems to be under assault by the Trump administration. It is at just those moments when old categories start to collapse, however, that room often opens up for something new. A nascent resistance, right now, is delivering an unusually loud and impassioned “no. ” But the mere act of refusal often turns out to have its own momentum. As people learn that they can indeed say “no,” they may begin to find new ways toward saying “yes. ”"

Subject:  Your Blog Post at SkepticalScience and an Invitation from WattsUpWithThat
From:  Bob Tisdale
To: Kevin Trenberth – NCAR
Dear Kevin:
I note that you were co-author of the SkepticalScience blog post Warming oceans consistent with rising sea level & global energy imbalance along with Dana Nuccitelli and Rob Painting.  The obvious intent of your post was to convince the SkepticalScience readers that, while the global surface warming (outside of the Arctic) has slowed or stopped since the late 1990s, human-induced global warming continues in the deep oceans.  There have been numerous blog posts at SkepticalScience over the past few years that have basically stated the same thing, so, from the sidelines, it appears you’re preaching to the choir.
One would think your time would be better spent trying to convince actual global warming skeptics why we should be concerned about global warming …especially when we consider that in your recent papers you’re acknowledging that natural variability plays a major role in the warming of the surface of the planet. With that in mind, this is an open invitation for you to author a blog post or series of them for WattsUpWithThat (or co-author them with skeptics…like me, for example).  There are a number of points you may wish to address and they are discussed in the bulk of this post.

WattsUpWithThat has a much larger internet audience than SkepticalScience.  Refer to the recent Alexa statistics here.  If you’re not familiar with the Alexa rankings, the lower rankings are better.  Point of reference: Google ranks first. Also note the bounce rates and the time visitors spend on both websites.  Many more people visit WattsUpWithThat than SkepticalScience and they stay longer at WattsUpWithThat once they’re there.  That suggests, of course, if you were to write a post for WattsUpWithThat, more people are likely to read it.
INITIAL COMMENT ON YOUR SKEPTICALSCIENCE POST
Assuming you’re correct and the deep oceans are warming instead of the surface, then your post at SkepticalScience likely appears to many readers to be nothing more than redirection—because it refocuses attention from the problems that climate models are having simulating global surface temperatures.   The previous generation (CMIP3) and current generation (CMIP5) climate models cannot explain the current pause in global warming (that’s occurring outside of the Arctic), thus your recent flurry of papers on this topic. Also assuming you’re right, due to the heat capacity of the oceans, the claimed increase in subsurface temperatures of the global oceans (while the halt is taking place at the surface) is so tiny…so minute…so miniscule…that the additional warming of the oceans is not coming back to haunt anyone at any time.
While the topics of ocean heat and energy imbalance have a place in technical discussions, they are of no importance to people and policymakers who want to know how high global surface temperatures might rise in the future and why climate models did not forecast the cessation of global surface warming.
PAST COMMENTS
At WattsUpWithThat, we’ve already discussed many of the arguments you’ve presented…discussed them numerous times. See the posts from my blog (and the cross posts at WUWT in parentheses):

You may want to review those posts, because those are arguments you will face if you choose to author a post for WattsUpWithThat.
POINTS MISSING FROM YOUR ARGUMENT
The core of your recent argument is that there was a turn-of-the-century switch of ENSO mode from a period of El Niño domination to a period when La Niñas dominate. Further to your argument, this change in mode around 1999 has caused the tropical Pacific to release less heat than normal to the atmosphere and to redistribute less warm water from the tropical Pacific to adjoining portions of the oceans. You’ve also argued that the stronger trade winds associated with La Niñas are forcing more warm water to be stored in the western tropical Pacific.   As a result, according to your argument, there has been a substantial decline in the warming rate of global surfaces (outside of the Arctic).
This strongly suggests that ENSO was also responsible for an extensive portion of the warming that took place while El Niño events dominated from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s. I don’t recall you ever stating that in so many words in any of the recent papers you’ve written on this topic, and I don’t believe, in light of your new understandings, that you’ve recently attempted to quantify the contribution of ENSO during that late 20th Century warming period.
Based on my research, ENSO—acting as a chaotic, naturally occurring, sunlight-fueled, recharge-discharge oscillator—was in fact responsible for the vast majority of the warming of global sea surface temperatures outside of the North Atlantic during the past 32 years (the satellite era)…and ENSO was also responsible for the vast majority of the warming of the tropical Pacific to depth…and ENSO, along with a shift in sea level pressure (and interdependent wind patterns) of the extratropical North Pacific (as captured by the North Pacific Index that you, Kevin, developed for such purposes) were responsible for most of the long-term warming of the extratropical North Pacific ocean to depths of 700 meters.  Add to that the findings of Lozier et al. (2008) The Spatial Pattern and Mechanisms of Heat-Content Change in the North Atlantic.   They found that all the warming of the North Atlantic to depth could be explained by natural factors. See the January 2008 article in ScienceDaily titled North Atlantic Warming Tied to Natural Variability about Lozier et al. (2008).  The ScienceDaily article includes:
“We suggest that the large-scale, decadal changes…associated with the NAO [North Atlantic Oscillation] are primarily responsible for the ocean heat content changes in the North Atlantic over the past 50 years,” the authors concluded.
Those points were discussed in the posts linked earlier. They should be addressed by you if you elect to prepare a post for WattsUpWithThat.
DATA THAT CONFIRM AND CONTRADICT YOUR ARGUMENT
Based on your argument, the ocean heat content of the western tropical Pacific should be increasing during the hiatus period. In one of your recent papers you argued that the hiatus period started in 1999, with the switch from a positive to a negative Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which you’re using a proxy for ENSO modes.  Figure 1 presents the NODC ocean heat content for the western tropical Pacific (24S-24N, 120E-180), for the depths of 0-700 meters, for the period of January 1999 to December 2013. We can see that the western tropical Pacific to depths of 700 meters has, in fact, warmed.

Figure 1
As you’re well aware, the TAO project buoys have sampled subsurface temperatures, etc., in the tropical Pacific since the early 1990s, so the NODC data should be a reasonably reliable there.  Over the past decade, ARGO floats have supplemented the TAO buoys.  And the source Ocean Heat Content data in the tropical Pacific for 0-700 meters and 0-2000 meters (represented by the unadjusted UKMO EN3 data) during the TAO project and ARGO eras are exactly the same, see Figure 2, and that suggests that all of the variability in the tropical Pacific ocean heat content is taking place in the top 700 meters.

Figure 2
The NODC ocean heat content data also show the ocean heat content (0-700m) of the eastern tropical Pacific, a much larger region, has been cooling from 1999 to 2013. See Figure 3.

Figure 3
As a result, there has been an overall decrease in the ocean heat content of the tropical Pacific since 1999, Figure 4, and a substantial decrease in the ocean heat content of the tropical Pacific as a whole since the peak around 2004.

Figure 4
Therefore, based on data, there appears to have been a rearrangement of heat within the tropical Pacific and not an addition of new heat as your studies suggest.
Also, in the recent post If Manmade Greenhouse Gases Are Responsible for the Warming of the Global Oceans… I presented the NODC’s vertical mean temperature anomaly data for the Indian, Pacific, North Atlantic and South Atlantic Oceans, for the depths of 0-2000 meters, during the ARGO era (starting in 2003).  Figure 5 is an update of that illustration, including the recently released 2013 data. The flatness of the Pacific trend indicates there has not been a substantial increase in the subsurface temperatures of the Pacific Ocean as a whole to depths of 2000 meters over the past 11 years…same with the North Atlantic.  Manmade greenhouse gases cannot explain the warming in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, when they obviously have had no impact on the warming of the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to 2000 meters over the past 11 years.

Figure 5
You might argue that the recent warming in the Indian Ocean is a response to ENSO. I would agree. I discussed a number of topics in the post Is Ocean Heat Content All It’s Stacked Up to Be?  One of them was the influence of ENSO on the warming of the Indian Ocean to depths of 700 meters.  The following is that discussion. Note that I’ve linked the animations and revised the Figure number for this post.
[Start of a portion of “Is Ocean Heat Content All It’s Stacked Up to Be?”]
Why is the Indian Ocean warming during the ARGO era? Figure 6 compares ocean heat content data for the Indian Ocean (90S-90N, 20E-120E) to scaled sea surface temperature anomalies for the NINO3.4 region of the equatorial Pacific. Both datasets have been smoothed with 12-month running average filters. The NINO3.4 data is a commonly used index for the timing, strength and duration of El Niño and La Niña events. The ocean heat content for the Indian Ocean warms in response to El Niño events, but it obviously does not cool proportionally during strong La Niñas.
Why?
It’s simply yet another example of what I’ve been noting for a number of years: La Niñas are not the opposite of El Niños.

Figure 6
In the following animations, you can watch warm water that’s left over from the El Niños being passed from the tropical Pacific into the Indian Ocean during the trailing La Niñas by the current called the Indonesian Throughflow. That leftover warm water counteracts any cooling that would result during the trailing La Niñas due to changes in atmospheric circulation.
ANIMATION 1 presents maps of the NODC ocean heat content data for the ARGO-era, using 12-month averages. The first cells are the average ocean heat content from January to December 2003. These are followed by cells that show the period of February 2003 to January 2004, then March 2003 to February 2004 and so on, until the final cell that captures the average ocean heat content from January to December 2012. The 12-month averages reduce the visual noise and any seasonal component in the data. It’s like smoothing data with a 12-month filter in a time-series graph.
Due to the resolution of the ocean heat content data, you might be having trouble catching the processes that cause the leftover warm water from 2006/07 and 2009/10 El Niños to be carried into the Indian Ocean. ANIMATION 2 is a gif animation of sea level maps for the tropical Pacific from the AVISO altimetry website.  The maps also capture the easternmost portion of the tropical Indian Ocean. I’ve started the animation in January 2003 to agree with the discussion of ARGO-era ocean heat content data. So there are a couple of minor El Niños before the 2006/07 El Niño.  At the end of the 2006/07 El Niño, a (cool) downwelling Kelvin wave splits the elevated (warm) sea level anomalies along the equator. The residual warm waters are carried west by Rossby waves to Indonesia, and the stronger-than-normal trade winds in the Pacific during the trailing La Niña help to force the residual warm water past Indonesia into the eastern Indian Ocean. In addition to the Indonesian Throughflow, warm water from the southern tropical Pacific also migrates west into the eastern Indian Ocean through the Torres Strait, between Australia and New Guinea. The same thing happens after the 2009/10 El Niño. (My apologies for the shift in the animation in 2011. Aviso changed the format of the maps.)
[End of the portion of “Is Ocean Heat Content All It’s Stacked Up to Be?”]
A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS ON TRENBERTH ET AL. (2014)
Thank you for linking a preprint copy of Trenberth et al. (2014) “Earth’s Energy Imbalance” to your SkepticalScience post.   Sorry to say, I haven’t had the opportunity to study it in any detail.  But I did take a quick glance.  Thank you for including a number of ocean heat content datasets, in addition to the ECMWF ORA-S4.  We’ve discussed the problems with that reanalysis in many of the posts listed at the beginning of this one, so I’m not going to dwell on it here…though I note you’re continuing to try to justify using the ORA-S4 reanalysis by showing that it responds to volcanic aerosols where other datasets do not.  (Not surprising since the ORA-S4 reanalysis is the output of a computer model that’s forced to cool by volcanic aerosols.)
Also note your Figure 11, which I’ve included as my Figure 7, is missing a La Niña event.

Figure 7
According to the paper you used the old version of the ONI index (base years 1971-2000) as your reference for official El Niño and La Niña events. Clearly, you overlooked the strong 2010/11 La Niña that followed the 2009/10 El Niño. Also, moderate strength La Niña conditions existed during the 2008/09 ENSO season, but they didn’t last long enough to be considered an “official” La Niña based on the old ONI climatology.   I’m not sure that helps you for 2008/09 or in 2010/11.
Again, I haven’t had the chance to examine your new paper in much detail. Sorry.
ENSO IS FUELED BY SUNLIGHT, ACCORDING TO YOU, KEVIN
In your much-cited Trenberth et al. (2002) The evolution of ENSO and global atmospheric surface temperatures, you stated:
The negative feedback between SST and surface fluxes can be interpreted as showing the importance of the discharge of heat during El Niño events and of the recharge of heat during La Niña events. Relatively clear skies in the central and eastern tropical Pacific allow solar radiation to enter the ocean, apparently offsetting the below normal SSTs, but the heat is carried away by Ekman drift, ocean currents, and adjustments through ocean Rossby and Kelvin waves, and the heat is stored in the western Pacific tropics. This is not simply a rearrangement of the ocean heat, but also a restoration of heat in the ocean. Similarly, during El Niño the loss of heat into the atmosphere, especially through evaporation, is a discharge of the heat content, and both contribute to the life cycle of ENSO.
Thus my earlier description of ENSO as a chaotic, naturally occurring, sunlight-fueled, recharge-discharge oscillator…with El Niños acting as the discharge phase and La Niñas acting as the recharge phase. But La Niñas also help to redistribute the leftover warm waters from the El Niños—something that was very obvious in the animations linked above.
That quote from 2002 leads to a very basic question: how can you now suggest that the dominance of La Niña events in recent years has caused more greenhouse gas warming of the Pacific to depth, when La Niña events are fueled by sunlight?
To that end, if you should elect to prepare a blog post for us here at WattsUpWithThat, please document the downward shortwave radiation and the downwelling longwave radiation, both at the surface of the tropical Pacific, from the ECMFW ORA-S4 reanalysis, which you rely on so much for your recent papers.
BIG JUMPS
You occasionally describe “big jumps” in global surface temperatures.  Your big jumps were discussed in my Open Letter to the Royal Meteorological Society Regarding Dr. Trenberth’s Article “Has Global Warming Stalled?” You have more recently added to those discussions of big jumps.  For example, you also referred to the big jumps in your August 2013 interview on NPR  (my boldface):
The oceans can at times soak up a lot of heat. Some goes into the deep oceans where it can stay for centuries. But heat absorbed closer to the surface can easily flow back into the air. That happened in 1998, which made it one of the hottest years on record.
Trenberth says since then, the ocean has mostly been back in one of its soaking-up modes.
“They probably can’t go on much for much longer than maybe 20 years, and what happens at the end of these hiatus periods, is suddenly there’s a big jump [in temperature] up to a whole new level and you never go back to that previous level again,” he says.
You can think of it like a staircase. Temperature is flat when a natural cool spell cancels out the gradual temperature increase caused by human activity. But when there’s a natural warm spell on top of the long-term warming trend, the story is dramatically different.
“When the natural variability or when the weather is going in the same direction as global warming, suddenly we’re breaking records, we’re going outside of the bounds of previous experience, and that is when the real damage occurs,” Trenberth says.
First, once again, you’re suggesting that El Niño events caused a portion of the surface warming during the late 20th Century. It had to have been a major portion if a switch to La Niña domination could stop the surface warming.  Why not simply come out and state it?  Is it because people will then realize that by recognizing that a series of strong El Niños contributed to the warming from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s that you are also recognizing the models have overestimated the future warming?  We already understand that…well, most of us do.  And people also realize that you also haven’t included the influence of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, which also contributed to the warming during the late 20th Century.  Why not simply state that the models predictions are too high and that they’re probably too high by at least a factor of two?
In the portion of your NPR interview I highlighted above, you suggest that a strong El Niño event can cause a big jump in surface temperatures.  We understand that.  I first presented those “big jumps” in sea surface temperature more than 5 years ago. And we also agree with you that El Niños are fueled by sunlight…which is part of the “life cycle of ENSO”, as you stated more than a decade ago.  But I am very curious about why you seem concerned that “you never go back to that previous level again” after a big jump caused by a strong El Niño.  That is precisely what we would expect to happen in a world where natural processes are causing the vast majority of the warming…a world in which the oceans show little influence from the effects of the increased emissions of manmade greenhouse gases.
The 1995/96 La Niña created the warm water for the 1997/98 El Niño via a reduction in cloud cover and an increase in sunlight over the tropical Pacific. The 1997/98 El Niño released that warm water from beneath the surface of the western tropical Pacific…and, in turn, it released a substantial amount of heat into the atmosphere…and an unfathomable volume of warm water was then redistributed around the global oceans in the wake of the 1997/98 El Niño.  That leftover warm water prevented global surface temperatures from cooling proportionally during the trailing 1998-01 La Niña.  The 1998-01 La Niña also served to replace the warm water in the tropical Pacific that was released and redistributed by the 1997/98 El Niño. Everything fits for a naturally warming world…a world that is not as sensitive to manmade greenhouse gases as simulated by climate models (climate models which still cannot simulate basic ENSO processes).
“THE PAUSE IS FICTIONAL; OCEAN WARMING IS FACTUAL”???
I suspect your co-authors Dana Nuccitelli and Rob Painting wrote that heading for the closing of the SkepticalScience post, Kevin.  It’s comical and misleading. Data indicate the oceans are warming to depth, but the warming is not occurring in all ocean basins.  Additionally, you, Kevin, wouldn’t have been spending so much of your time over the past few years trying to explain the cessation of global warming outside of the Arctic if the “pause was fictional”.
At the rate the global oceans have warmed to 2000 meters during the ARGO era, Figure 8, no one should really be too concerned about the warming of those oceans, especially when the data suggests it warmed via natural processes.

Figure 8
And no one should be concerned about the observed warming of the oceans to depth when we consider that the warming of the global oceans can cease for almost a decade, according to ORA-S4 reanalysis you continue to present.  See my Figure 9, which is an annotated version of the first graph you presented in your blog post.

Figure 9
The following exchange is from the NPR interview linked above:
So will the oceans come to our rescue?
“That’s a good question, and the answer is maybe partly yes, but maybe partly no,” he says.
The oceans can at times soak up a lot of heat. Some goes into the deep oceans where it can stay for centuries. But heat absorbed closer to the surface can easily flow back into the air. That happened in 1998, which made it one of the hottest years on record.
But, again, the warm water for the 1997/98 El Niño was created via a temporary increase in sunlight beating down on the tropical Pacific as part of “the life cycle of ENSO”.
CLOSING
Thank you for considering the possibility of preparing a blog post or series of them for us here at WattsUpWithThat.  Many of us applaud you in your efforts to explain the slowdown and cessation of surface warming, but there are many points that need clarification.
Additionally, we really appreciate it when authors of blog posts answer questions posed to them on the thread, so you should expect further exchanges.
Last, if this invitation interests you, please feel free to leave a comment at WattsUpWithThat.  If you’d like the initial discussions to be off the record, please leave a comment at my blog Climate Observations where I still moderate comments. We can then discuss the matter further via email.
Sincerely,
Bob Tisdale

"The bodies just keep arriving. On Thursday, only two days into February, the coroner’s office in Dayton, Ohio, had already handled 25 deaths  —   18 caused by drug overdoses. In January, the office processed 145 cases in which the victims’ bodies had been destroyed by opioids. Now, the Montgomery County Coroner’s Office is so crammed with corpses that it has asked a local funeral parlor to take in four bodies for “temporary storage,” the first time it has had to make such a request, Kenneth M. Betz, director of the coroner’s office, said on Thursday. “We’re running at full capacity,” he said in a phone interview. “We’ve never experienced this volume of accidental drug overdoses in our history. We now call funeral homes immediately” to ask if there is space available, he added. Widespread abuse of powerful opioid pain relievers in the United States  —   including oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone and fentanyl, heroin’s cheaper but deadlier cousin  —   has driven overdose death rates to historic highs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The C. D. C. ’s numbers show that 91 people in the United States die every day from opioid overdose. The number of bodies from accidental overdoses that have come to the Montgomery County Coroner’s Office in the first 33 days of the year  —   163  —   is already more than half the yearly totals for the past two years. In 2015, the total was 259 last year, the number of deaths from January to September was 253,  figures from the office show. In Ohio, fatal overdoses more than quadrupled in the past decade and by 2007 had surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of accidental death, according to the Department of Health. In 2015, 3, 310 deaths were recorded in the state from unintentional drug overdoses, a 21. 5 percent increase from the previous year, according to the C. D. C. Addiction is so entrenched and widespread that police officials say there are now third and fourth generations of prescription drug abusers. These days, hospitals in Cincinnati require drug testing of new mothers and infants because of a surge in newborns exposed to addictive drugs. The five states with the highest rates of death linked to drug overdose were West Virginia (41. 5 per 100, 000) New Hampshire (34. 3 per 100, 000) Kentucky (29. 9 per 100, 000) Ohio (29. 9 per 100, 000) and Rhode Island (28. 2 per 100, 000) according to the C. D. C. But significant increases were also seen in the Northeast and the South, the agency said, including Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Last year, Mr. Betz said Montgomery County’s coroner’s office had to use refrigerated trucks to store bodies for a week. In his 40 years in forensics, Mr. Betz said, he has never seen such a steady increase in overdose deaths, and it has left him and his colleagues feeling overwhelmed. “Our staff is, quite frankly, tired,” he said. “The doctors are tired. The investigators are tired. We’ve never had volumes like this. ” “This increase from year to year  —   I’ve never seen anything like this,” he said. “The drug problem we have is absolutely phenomenal. ”"

If you have been to the beach at Treasure Island, Florida (adjoining St. Petersburg), you will notice something very odd. The hotels (many of which were built in the 1950s and ‘60s) and the seawall are very far from the water in the Gulf of Mexico — giving an extraordinarily wide beach. It was not always that way. When the hotels and seawall were built, they were set back from the high tide a normal hundred yards or so; but over the years, there was a natural but unforeseen accretion to the beach — which, having grown up in the area, I observed. (It can be seen on Google Earth.)



It is a news story when a beach erodes and beach front homes fall into the sea. What is not a news story is that the sand that left one beach for the most part ends up on another beach. The sand barrier islands that ring much of the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts are in constant motion, moving up and down, in and out, and always have been. Yet people seem to be endlessly surprised when part of their beach or riverfront ends up adjoining someone else’s property.



This past week, former NASA scientist, James Hansen, who was one of the first to sound the alarm of global warming back in 1988, said that sea levels might rise as much as 10 feet in the next 50 years. His reasoning was so unsupported by evidence that even much of the global warming establishment is walking away from it. Sea levels have been slowing rising since the end of the last ice age 12,000 years ago, but over the last century the sea level rise has decelerated to less than seven inches per century, which mankind has shown it can easily adapt to. Mr. Hansen had predicted and continues to predict rapidly increasing global temperatures — which hasn’t happened. In fact, there has been a 17‐​year pause in the temperature rise — which neither Mr. Hansen nor any of the major global warming models predicted.



Some scientists at NOAA are now claiming that the 17‐​year pause in temperature rises did not occur because, if you take the year 2000 (a cold year) as the starting point, there has been a small temperature rise. But if you take 1998 as the starting point (a warm year), there has been almost no measurable temperature rise, say NOAA’s critics. The point is the scientists cannot agree on the length of time to show a trend. Even now, we have very imperfect measures of temperatures, let alone the quality of the measurements in decades past — so it is rather arrogant to make statements of great certainty about 100 year trends in temperature based on imperfect data from only a few decades.



More unsettling was a study by the Royal Astronomical Society published in Science Daily on July 9, which concludes that solar activity will be exceptionally diminished in the decade of 2030–40 as it was during the Maunder minimum of 1645–1715, a period of sharply lower temperatures known as the “little ice age.” Lower temperatures would be far more damaging than moderate global warming, because agricultural production could be greatly reduced. Note: there are many scientists who think changes in solar output, and/​or changes in cloud cover can easily swamp changes in CO2 levels in affecting the earth’s temperature.



New satellite data, reported in Climate Science on July 20, shows that Arctic Sea ice has now bounced back to levels last seen in the 1980s when modern measurements began. At the same time, southern sea ice around the Antarctic has grown to a thirty‐​year high from when it first began to be measured. Climate scientists admit that their models cannot account for the rise in sea ice. By the way, did not Al Gore tell us the Arctic Ocean would be free of sea ice by the summer of 2007?



Earlier this month, in testimony before the Congress, EPA Chief Administrator Gina McCarthy claimed that the agency’s pending rule to limit CO2 emissions from power plants would be “enormously beneficial,” even though she admitted that it would only reduce global temperature by one one‐​hundredth of a degree Celsius, according to the administration’s own estimates. Since it is widely acknowledged that the proposed rule will cause a sharp rise in the cost of electricity, most painful to low‐​income Americans, I can only assume that Ms. McCarthy means “enormously beneficial” for the bureaucrats at EPA who will have to administer the rule.



F.A. Hayek (1899–1992), the great economist and philosopher, warned us about “limits to knowledge” and “fatal conceit,” which is all too evident in much of the scientific establishment. What we do know is the climate and the earth’s physical features have been in continuous change — but it is all too clear that there is much disagreement about both the direction and magnitude of such changes. Those who say the “science is settled” have not been reading the scientific studies.

"Whales are the largest animals on the planet, and important predators in the marine ecosystem. As a marine biologist I have been lucky enough to see them up close. It’s an amazing experience to watch a whale mother, 14 metres long and weighing nearly 40 tonnes, gently push her “tiny” five-metre baby, already weighing nearly one tonne at birth, up to the surface to breathe. But how do I actually know that whale weighed 40 tonnes? After all, we can’t exactly capture an animal the size of a bus and simply put it on a scale. And swimming out into the ocean and putting a measuring tape around its body is not a very wise thing to do. For whale scientists, this is a big problem. The sheer size of these animals is fundamental to their success, as it allows them to store enough energy to undertake long distance migrations to find food in scattered locations. But though this should be factored in, it is seldom possible to incorporate body weight as a variable when studying free-living whales as it is so difficult to measure them. This is why we needed to develop a new non-invasive way of weighing whales. The solution colleagues and I came up with was to use a technique called photogrammetry – where the body size of the whales was measured from aerial photographs taken by drones.  We applied this technique to southern right whales in Península Valdés in Argentina. With two large round bays surrounding a central peninsula, Valdés has sheltered clear and shallow waters, which attracts lots of whales who congregate there to mate and give birth. This unusual geography also makes it a great place for researchers, as we could simply fly our drones from land and photograph lots of whales in perfect conditions very close to the shore.  With our drone, we were able to measure the body length, width, girth and height of the whales. From these measurements we were able to create an accurate 3D model of the whales, which we could use to predict its body volume.  You can play with the model whale here: 
Model 55B - 3D mesh Southern Right Whale
    by DigitalLife3D
    on Sketchfab
 But volume alone doesn’t tell us the weight of these whales – we’d also need to figure out their density. For that, we had to go through old records of closely related North Pacific right whales killed by scientific whaling operations. These records noted each whale’s length and girth but also, crucially, weight.  We then used our 3D model to work out the volume of each dead whale from its length and width, which we cross-referenced with their weight in order to calculate a volume-to-weight factor – or density. This meant we could calculate the weight of the live southern right whales just from their drone measurements. The full method is now presented in the scientific journal Methods in Ecology and Evolution.  Of course this is not the first time anyone has measured the weight of a whale. Most of our early knowledge of large whale physiology comes from the whaling industry, where whales were often measured, and sometimes even weighed, as part of the industry protocol. What our method offers however, is a way to weigh the whales without having to kill them.  Apart from being more benign, photogrammetry makes it possible to measure the same whale over time, to study growth and changes in body condition such as fat reserves. It also allows us to sample the health of small vulnerable populations that would not be able to sustain scientific whaling. Hence, our approach opens up a new avenue of research into large whale ecology and physiology, which we believe will greatly benefit both science and the conservation of these amazing creatures.  Another study I led a few years ago showed that noise from the drone does not penetrate into the water, so we can quietly observe them from above in their natural behaviour while taking our measurements. The whales don’t even notice we are there."
"The bushfires royal commission has been told the ongoing coronavirus crisis could mean firefighters cannot travel interstate to help battle blazes during the next fire season. The senior counsel assisting the commission, Dominique Hogan-Doran SC, said on Wednesday the extreme conditions experienced during 2019-20 saw resources in impacted states and territories stretched over a long and arduous bushfire season.  The states and territories all received help from interstate as well as about 900 international personnel, mainly from New Zealand, Canada and the US. There were close to 200,000 firefighting shifts used to battle 11,000 to 12,000 NSW fires, the commission heard, with 6500 interstate and international firies in total coming to the state’s aid. Hogan-Doran said a very real consideration was that the coronavirus pandemic may be ongoing during the 2020-21 bushfire season and possibly beyond. “This may well impact the assistance able to be provided by international and interstate deployments of personnel and assets,” she said. Separately, the man who led NSW’s response to that state’s devastating blazes in 2019-20 said no one could have predicted the scale of the unprecedented fires. The former NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described the recent bushfire season as extraordinary in terms of weather, fire behaviour and the widespread damage, destruction and tragedy. “We saw an area burnt across NSW like we haven’t seen before, particularly across the forested areas,” Fitzsimmons told the natural disasters royal commission on Wednesday. “We saw a protracted nature of the fire season without any meaningful interruption from weather.” Fitzsimmons, who now heads up the state’s lead disaster management agency Resilience NSW, said traditionally there would be some reprieve in the weather, but that did not happen last season. He noted the outlook for the 2019-20 season had been almost identical to that for 2018-19 in terms of where above-normal fire activity was expected. “Obviously the indications were for above normal, but no one had the capacity to forecast and predict the extent and the scale to which weather and fire behaviour played out with a stretching of fire literally from the Queensland border all the way through to the Victorian border along the Great Dividing Range.” He said the fire behaviour and fire spread well and truly exceeded the worst-case scenario on a number of occasions. “We saw fire behaviour at 2, 3 or 4am in the morning the likes of which you might normally expect at 2, 3 or 4pm in the afternoon where traditional conditions are at their worst.” In NSW, 50 local government areas were affected by the bushfires, which burnt 5.5m hectares and destroyed 2,476 houses, 284 facilities and 5,559 outbuildings and led to 26 deaths. “Throughout the season we saw an unprecedented toll for NSW when it came to damage, destruction, despair and tragedy,” Fitzsimmons said."
"Electric cars are often seen as one of the great hopes for tackling climate change. With new models arriving in showrooms, major carmakers retooling for an electric future, and a small but growing number of consumers eager to convert from gas guzzlers, EVs appear to offer a way for us to decarbonise with little change to our way of life. Yet there is a danger that fixating on electric cars leaves a large blind spot. Electrification would be very expensive for the lumbering lorries that haul goods across continents or is currently technically prohibitive for long-distance air travel. Beyond all the enthusiasm surrounding electrification, currently light-duty passenger vehicles only comprise 50% of total global demand for energy in the transportation sector compared to 28% for heavy road vehicles, 10% for air, 9% for sea and 2% for rail.  Put simply, the current focus on electrifying passenger vehicles – though welcome – represents only part of the answer. For most other segments, fuels will be needed for the foreseeable future. And even for cars, electric vehicles are not a cure-all. The unfortunate truth is that, on their own, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) cannot solve what we call the “100 EJ problem”. Demand for transport services are expected to rise dramatically in the coming decades. So the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that we need to significantly reduce the amount of energy each vehicle uses just to keep total global energy demand in the transport sector roughly flat at current levels of 100 exajoules (EJ) by 2050. More than half of that 100 EJ is still expected to come from petroleum products and, by then, the share of light-duty vehicles in transport sector energy demand is expected to decline from 50% to 34%. The vast majority of existing passenger trips can be accommodated by existing battery electric vehicles so, for many consumers, buying one will be an easy decision (as costs come down). But for those who frequently take very long journeys, the focus also needs to be on lower-carbon fuels. Petroleum substitutes could extend sustainable transport to heavier vehicles and those seeking longer range, while using the existing refuelling infrastructure and vehicle fleet. Whereas battery electric vehicles will impose wider system costs (for example, the charging infrastructure needed to connect millions of new electric vehicles to the grid), all the transition costs of sustainable fuel substitutes are in the fuels themselves. Our recent study is part of a renewed focus on synthetic fuels or synfuels (fuels converted from feedstocks other than petroleum). Synfuels were first made on an industrial scale in the 1920s by turning coal into liquid hydrocarbons using the so called Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, named after its original German inventors. But using coal as a feedstock produces far dirtier fuel than even conventional petroleum-based fuels. One possible route to carbon-neutral synthetic fuels would be to use woody residues and wastes as feedstock to create synthetic biofuels with less impact on the environment and food production than crop-based biofuels. Another option would be to produce synfuels from CO₂ and water using low-carbon electricity. But producing such “electrofuels” would need either a power system that is very low cost and ultra-low-carbon (such as those of Iceland or Quebec) or require dedicated sources of zero-carbon electricity that have high availability throughout the year. Synthetic biofuels and electrofuels both have the potential to deliver sustainable fuels at scale, but these efforts are still at the demonstration stage. Audi opened a €20M e-gas (electrofuel) plant in 2013 that produces 3.2 MW of synthetic methane from 6 MW of electricity. The €150M Swedish GoBiGas plant was commissioned in 2014 and produced synthetic biomethane at a scale of 20 MW using 30 MW of biomass. Despite the many virtues of carbon-neutral synthetic fuels though, most commercial-scale projects are currently on hold. This is due to the high investment cost of pioneer process plants combined with a lack of sufficiently strong government policies to make then economically viable and share the risk of scale-up. Government and industry attempts to encourage people to buy electric vehicles aren’t a problem in themselves. Our concern is that an exclusive focus on electrification may make solving the 100 EJ problem impossible. It is too early to tell which, if any, sustainable fuels will emerge successful and so the most pressing need is to scale up production from the current demonstration stage. If not, when our attention finally turns away from glossy electric car advertisements in a few years, we will find ourselves at a standing start in addressing the rest of the problem.

"Hurricane Dorian was the second most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record and the fifth to reach the highest hurricane category (five) in the past four years. After it first made landfall, it hovered over the northern Bahamas for more than 50 hours. The human death toll is currently around 50 but more than 1,000 people are still missing and at least 70,000 have been left homeless. Many residents have lost everything, including their tourism industry, and are in desperate need of humanitarian assistance.  At a time of such immense human tragedy, it may seem too soon to mourn the loss of wildlife. But, as a conservation biologist who specialises in island ecology, I am also worried about the Bahamas’s unique birdlife – several species may have have been severely harmed or even lost, literally overnight.  Just this time last year, my UEA master’s students, Matthew Gardner and David Pereira, spent several months researching birds on Grand Bahama island and were able to announce the rediscovery of a species that had not been seen since Hurricane Matthew in 2016: the Bahama nuthatch (Sitta insularis). One of several bird species endemic to these islands – that is, it lives nowhere else – the nuthatch is a tiny bird that nests in tree cavities.  The nuthatch was already suffering from habitat fragmentation, invasive predators such as snakes and cats and the local extinction of a native woodpecker species, the West Indian woodpecker, in the 1990s. This woodpecker had previously created tree holes subsequently used by the nuthatch, which likes to nest in small cavities. Matthew, David and others from the University of the Bahamas played a recording of the nuthatch’s call in order to attract and observe it – they found the bird was alive after all. However, we feared numbers may be as low as just one or two individuals.  Sadly, the species is unlikely to have survived Dorian.  In fact, Dorian may have not only sealed the fate of the nuthatch but also severely impacted other birds endemic to these islands, particularly the Bahama warbler and the Abaco parrot. Also known as the Bahama Amazon parrot, this subspecies uniquely nests in limestone cavities on the ground which are likely to have been flooded by the storm surge. Other birds we’re worried about include the Bahama yellow throat, Olive-capped warbler, the Bahama woodstar hummingbird and the Bahama swallow.  Scientists don’t know exactly how different birds try to escape the strong winds and heavy rainfall associated with hurricanes. It’s not the easiest thing to study in nature, for obvious reasons. We do know that previous storms have blown species like the swallow and woodstar as far as Florida or even Pennsylvania, so it’s possible that some individuals particularly the swallows may have escaped by flying to other islands ahead of the hurricane. But for most birds, the best chance of survival would have been to seek shelter in the pine forest. Once covering much of the islands, this native ecosystem had evolved alongside Atlantic hurricanes and should in theory provide native birds with protection from a major storm. However, throughout the 20th century much of the Bahama pine forest was lost to industrial logging or urban development, and what remains is highly fragmented. More recently, major hurricanes have caused direct wind damage and storm surges that have sent salt water far inland, killing trees.  For the birds, all this is a disaster. Not only has much of their native habitat disappeared, but going down from trees to hide in ground cover would not be an option if the ground was flooded by the torrential rain. All this is compounded by a further environmental impact of Dorian: an oil spill from a large storage facility on Grand Bahama island which is reported to have been holding 1.8m barrels at the time. That, along with the fact a hurricane usually dumps lots of plastic into the ocean, means even surviving birds may struggle to find feed and fresh water.  Globally, as many as 182 bird species are thought to have become extinct over the past five centuries. Of these, an astonishing 92% have been island species. We can blame most of these historical extinctions on habitat destruction and introduced species such as rats and cats. But in future, endangered birds on oceanic islands must also contend with stronger and more frequent hurricanes driven by climate change. The lesson from Dorian is that we must conserve and restore as much native plant habitat as possible. On islands like the Bahamas, native plants often themselves now endangered, provide crucial habitats for threatened species, and conserve freshwater and soils thus protecting against erosion and landslides. The Caribbean has a wealth of endemic plants and animals, many of which are threatened by human activities. It has therefore been recognised as a global biodiversity hotspot.  It’s hard to say for certain what climate change and more frequent strong hurricanes will mean for this biodiversity, but the avifauna and habitat surveys conducted by Matthew and David in 2018 provide a crucial baseline for us to determine the ecological impact of Dorian on the Bahamas. What has just happened may represent the irreplaceable loss of a small but nonetheless precious part of the planet’s biological heritage."

Speaking of rugby, which it seems most of the country has been over the past week, is it time for the All Blacks to drop the haka?



It was a quaint, quirky point of difference in the early days and it’s understandable that it became iconic with live TV coverage. Indeed, it could be argued that in most parts of the world, people who have never taken the slightest interest in rugby or the All Blacks, are well aware that the All Blacks and haka go together. In many parts of Europe, mention you’re from New Zealand and you’re almost guaranteed to hear back “Ahhhh All Blacks – haka” and get a big smile.



Of course, if you get to dig a little deeper, many of those same people think we’re all natives living in grass huts and running around in grass skirts sticking our tongues out at each other! 



But joking aside: Has the haka reached its use by date? Has it become “oh no – not the haka again”.



Apart from the fact that it is an absolute cultural appropriation of the highest order, couch it in whatever affectionate terms you like, it is a Maori war dance. It is aggressive. It is threatening. It is abusive. That is exactly what it is intended to be and let’s not mince words: It’s about beating the daylights out of the other side and actually… slitting their throats. A matter that was brought vividly to our attention when the All Blacks first performed Kapa o Pango and the final gesture was that throat-slitting gesture which was dropped after a few performances. Dropped because the public reacted to it and didn’t like it.



How ironic, that one gesture was dropped because it was perceived as too violent and the public didn’t like it, yet the entire message of the entire haka is one of complete devastation of the opposition.



It doesn’t matter that the actual words are less of a violent challenge than the actions. People don’t know the words. But they sure do get the gestures and we really do need to question if such violent gestures fit into the world we live in today.



If it’s good enough to get rid of inanimate historic statues because they represent a time in the past that some find distasteful, or to demand name changes to streets or towns or buildings because they relate to people involved with slavery or – horror of horrors – colonisation, how can it possibly be OK for our national team, in our national sport, to present this as normal and acceptable at a sporting event?



Then on top of all of this comes the expectation that other teams must stand respectfully and politely and at an appropriate distance while a mass of All Blacks shout abuse and poke out their tongues at them – hissing and spitting.



Geez – if you behaved like that towards somebody on the street you’d be arrested. Surely it’s gilding the lily to suggest it is in any way acceptable or appropriate.

"Indonesia is currently in the throes of an environmental emergency. Thousands of hectares of forest are burning across the vast country, causing toxic smoke to be released into the atmosphere. This has led to eerie apocalyptic scenes of deep red skies, deserted streets and people with their faces covered with masks.  Such fires send huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. The last massive outbreak, in 2015, saw the fires emitting more greenhouse gases than the entire US. They’re also a disaster for the orangutans and other wildlife in the forest.  But what about the impact on affected humans? Who is at risk – and how? Wildfires and haze are not uncommon in Indonesia. Small-scale farmers have traditionally used small and well-controlled fires to clear land for the planting of new crops, but now the fires are getting bigger and more frequently burning out of control.  Partly, this is because the amount of land devoted to commercial production has steadily increased. Carbon-rich peatland forests on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan have been extensively cleared to create new plantations, often to produce palm oil. Weak land tenure security has also led to conflicts between local communities and plantation companies, where burning land has become a weapon to exercise pressure. All this has been exacerbated by the El Niño weather phenomenon which in some years has caused extraordinarily dry conditions. So far, more than 35,000 fires have been detected in 2019 in the country and air pollution levels are classified as “hazardous” according to the Air Quality Index (AQI). This year’s fires have been indeed the worst since 2015, when more than 2.5m hectares of land burned, causing a US$16 billion loss – a substantially larger sum than even the reconstruction costs of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. But exposure to the wildfires and their subsequent toxic smoke also causes short and long-term damage to human lives. The smoke generated by burning wood and vegetation contains lots of very fine particles, too small for the human eye to see. These particles can easily lodge deep into the lungs and can pass into other organs or the bloodstream.  To see what mass exposure to this sort of pollution may mean in the longer term, we can look at the effects of massive wildfires in late 1997, which burned more than 5m hectares of land and sent a huge pollution cloud across South-East Asia. Before 2015, these were Indonesia’s biggest fires on record. Various researchers have analysed data from population surveys taken during and after the fires, and found that the smoke generated by the fires harmed adult health and child survival rates at the time, and led to lower health and educational achievements in the longer-term. For instance, one study found that exposure to the toxic smoke resulted in significant worsening of physical functioning. These effects were especially prolonged among women aged 30-55 years and older adults. Other research has found that smoke-contaminated air, soil and food is particularly bad for pre and postnatal health. Toxicants inhaled by the mother interferes with her health, which in turn disrupts foetal nutrition and oxygen flow. One study found that exposure to the Indonesian wildfires of late 1997 lead to more than 15,600 child, infant, and foetal deaths, or a 1.2 percentage point decrease in the survival of the exposed cohorts. Poorer people were worst affected. Finally, child nutrition and health can be directly impaired through inhaling toxicants or ingesting them in contaminated raw food, and as a result of the temporary lack of adequate care given by unhealthy adult family members.  My own research, published earlier in 2019, is relevant here. I looked at young children aged 12-36 months living in the affected islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan during the 1997 fires, and I compared them with a comparable group of children who lived in areas not affected by the fires.  I found that exposure to the fires resulted in a significantly slower growth rate of about 1mm per month within the three-month period between first exposure to the fires in September 1997 and the final measurement that December. Doesn’t sound like much? Well bear in mind that children that age are growing around 1cm a month, so those that I studied were losing a tenth of their growth rate.  The 1997 haze lasted for just a few months. But a few months is a long time when you are a toddler, and for the cohort I studied the fires happened during a critical period where brain development is more sensitive to nutritional shocks. This then had important repercussions when these children reached school age: on average they delayed enrolment in primary school by six months, and eventually achieved almost one year less of education compared to the group not affected by fires.  It is not yet clear whether 2019’s fires will reach the scale of the disasters seen in 1997 or 2015. But these studies all imply that exposure to the wildfires entails a real risk for human well-being. Previous generations of Indonesian children paid the price – if we are to ensure today’s children don’t suffer similar problems, then action needs to be taken to protect the most vulnerable."

I’m worried about my kids. I fear they will be living in a world that will be less democratic, one where the citizens will be enslaved by technology and live in markets that will be firmly under the control of a faceless, unaccountable technocracy run by so-called self-anointed master central planners. This is what is taking hold in today’s Germany.
Let them ride electric bikes
Germany’s Federal Ministry of Environment (UBA) has just released a publication on one of the key components it envisions for the country’s future mobility scheme for the masses: electric bicycles, or pedelecs, see above for an example variant.
The reports abstract tells us:
As part of an integrated transport planning scheme, pedelecs are an important component of sustainable mobility in cities, but also, most notably, in rural areas. From an environmental perspective, this type of electric vehicle should be embraced, actively promoted and encouraged in order to make pedelecs appealing to more user groups as an attractive, inexpensive and environmentally sound form of transport that constitutes an alternative to private motorized transport.”
The aim, of course, so they say, is to rescue the climate by reducing the emissions of “pollutant” CO2, especially by cars. And to do this, central planning by masterminds is the only way. The green trend is one that is taking us back to bad old days of notoriously inefficient communist-style central planning. One only needs to look at Germany’s “Energiewende” to realize just how bad the inefficiency is getting.
I don’t have anything against people buying e-bikes, of course, but I do have serious reservations about governments punishing us out of our dependable, safe, and efficient cars and throwing us a dog treat every time we move or behave in a way they feel is best.
I’ve looked at e-bikes, but found them far too expensive for the real benefit they offer.

Will replace few cars
Unfortunately the grand scheme of the e-bike will end up having a similar result as the renewable energies. The German government has so far committed 200 billion euros to expanding green energies by some 80 gigawatts, but they have yet to reduce the consumption of coal and gas fired electricity by any significant amount. More on that tomorrow. The result will be similar with e-bikes…few cars will get replaced.

Utopian fantasy
One problem is the that the e-bike has become a utopian fantasy for the UBA. To illustrate this, just look at the photos it uses in its report. The powerful government agency would like us to think that the weather in Germany is like the weather in Phoenix, Arizona – in November, and year-round – where temperatures and conditions are very agreeable. The truth is that German weather is often very lousy, cold, wet, windy, and so traveling by e-bike is often far from pleasurable or practical.
People will still need to buy and own cars for bad weather and for most trips over 10 kilometers, or trips involving a passenger. E-bikes will replace very few cars – unless it gets forced. Nothing offers flexibility, comfort, speed and convenience like the automobile, and few people will be willing to give it up.
Cargo cycles, pedelecs for business trips
In its recommendation part of the report, the UBA urges political decision makers provide “ample financial and human resources for the development of bike-friendly infrastructure” and that businesses implement pedelecs in commercial traffic and employ “cargo cycles” and for transport tasks. It also recommends pedelecs for business trips and commuter journeys to work premises. “Many car and compact van trips can instead be made using pedelecs or bikes,” the UBA writes.
To me an e-bike sounds like a good way to limit the freedom and mobility of women who stay home to care for the family.

"WASHINGTON  —   New sanctions that the Trump administration imposed on Friday to punish Tehran’s latest ballistic missile test marked the beginning of what officials called the end of an era in which the United States was “too tolerant of Iran’s bad behavior. ” In what was described as the first in a series of efforts to confront Iran around the globe, the ban on banking transfers was levied against 25 Iranians and companies that officials said assisted in Tehran’s ballistic missile program and support of terrorist groups. The immediate trigger for the sanctions, which drew from a list of targets drawn up last year by the Obama administration, was Iran’s missile test last Sunday. The exact details of the test remain shrouded in considerable mystery. But the way the two countries jabbed at each other  —   with the White House saying it would “no longer tolerate Iran’s provocations that threaten our interests,” and Iranian state news media vowing retaliation  —   had distinct echoes of the darkest days before the July 2015 nuclear accord was reached. In striking that deal 19 months ago, the Obama administration was gambling that, over time, Washington and Tehran would learn how to manage their differences and cooperate on one or two discrete projects, starting with eliminating the Islamic State. But that era never arrived. And with the announcements on Friday, it became clearer than ever that leaders in both countries now see an advantage in taking a hard line  —   each betting that the other does not have the stomach for a risky, expensive confrontation. “The danger is that this is the first stage in an escalation that could culminate in a military confrontation between Iran and the United States, or Iran and Israel,” said Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “The entire eight years of the Obama administration was an example of unprecedented but largely unreciprocated overtures for cooperation with Iran in the Middle East. The Iranians weren’t interested. And now, the Iranians sense the rest of the world would not line up with the Trump administration. ” The sanctions themselves are unlikely to have a significant effect on Iranian action. They strike at specific companies and arms traders from Iran to Lebanon and China. Mr. Obama took similar steps a year ago, after another Iranian missile test. But by and large, his administration tried to   tensions  —   and at one point even assured European banks that, under the nuclear deal, they were free to resume transactions with Iran without fear of American retaliation. In announcing the new sanctions, the White House made clear that it planned to call out every violation, and respond. The Treasury Department took the unusual step of describing the inner workings of three networks that produce technology for Iran around the globe, in an effort to expose front companies and signal a new level of pressure on Tehran. “The international community has been too tolerant of Iran’s bad behavior,” said Michael T. Flynn, the president’s national security adviser. “The ritual of convening a United Nations Security Council in an emergency meeting and issuing a strong statement is not enough. The Trump administration will no longer tolerate Iran’s provocations that threaten our interests. ” Kate Bauer, a former Treasury official who is now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said the sanctions and the announcements surrounding it were “a way to take back the narrative, to declare that this is not a ‘  era. ’” “By providing so much public detail about the networks that feed Iran’s missile program,” she said, “they will cause significant disruption. ” Even inside the White House it is unclear how much further, beyond sanctions, President Trump is willing to take the confrontation. While he suggested during his campaign that he might scrap the nuclear deal, which he described as a “disaster,” both his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, and his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, made clear during their confirmation hearings that the world was better off with the accord, for the next decade at least, because of its prohibitions on Iran amassing enough enriched uranium or separated plutonium to manufacture even a single nuclear weapon. The Iranians have largely complied with every provision of the deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which conducts regular inspections of the nuclear facilities. When small violations have been found, the Iranians have quickly rectified them, including by shipping fuel out of the country. But nothing in the nuclear agreement deals with Iran’s support of Hezbollah or other terrorist groups, or its missile testing. A United Nations Security Council resolution, also negotiated in Vienna as the nuclear accord was being completed, calls on Iran to show restraint in testing, and prohibits test flights of a missile that could carry a nuclear warhead. Iran maintains that none of its missiles are designed for that purpose, though outside experts note it would be fairly easy to alter one to fit a warhead. It is unclear exactly what Iran was testing last weekend. Its missile traveled about 600 miles before its   vehicle exploded. That may have been accidental, or an intentional detonation. Reports in Germany have suggested that a cruise missile  —   harder to strike with missile defenses  —   was also launched, but American officials have not confirmed that. But in both Washington and Tehran, the test itself was clearly less important than the symbolism of the moment. Mr. Trump wanted to demonstrate he would not tolerate even minor infractions of Iran’s commitments. For their part, the Iranians wanted to demonstrate that they would continue any activity not specifically prohibited by the nuclear accord, and would not be intimidated. On Friday, hours after the sanctions were announced, the Foreign Ministry in Tehran promised to impose “legal restrictions” on an unspecified number of American individuals and entities  —   in effect, a retaliatory blacklist. Since Americans are already prohibited from doing business in Iran, it was far from clear what they had in mind. In a statement carried on state television, the ministry said the identities of the American targets would be announced later, and that those targeted “were involved in helping and founding regional terrorist groups. ” That appeared to be a response to a part of the sanctions aimed at Iran’s support for various proxy forces in the region, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen. A senior administration official called Iran’s moves “destabilizing. ” Asked whether the administration believed Iran controlled everything that Houthi rebels were doing in Yemen, he conceded that Tehran may not make every tactical decision but said it arms and supports the rebels. He said that the sanctions were “initial steps in response to Iranian provocative behavior. ” The official spoke at a briefing for reporters under rules, set by the administration, that prohibited naming those conducting it. Democrats did not criticize the sanctions, and even some former members of the Obama administration said they saw value in pushing back against the Iranians. But Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, warned against provoking Iran into further action. “I urge the administration to bring clarity to their overall strategy towards Iran, and to refrain from ambiguous rhetoric  —   or provocative tweets  —   that will exacerbate efforts to confront those challenges. ”"
"Scientists in Italy are investigating the mysterious appearance of pink glacial ice in the Alps, caused by algae that accelerate the effects of climate change. There is debate about where the algae come from, but Biagio Di Mauro of Italy’s National Research Council said the pink snow observed on parts of the Presena glacier is likely caused by the same plant found in Greenland.  “The alga is not dangerous, it is a natural phenomenon that occurs during the spring and summer periods in the middle latitudes but also at the Poles,” said Di Mauro, who had previously studied the algae at the Morteratsch glacier in Switzerland. The plant, known as Ancylonema nordenskioeldii, is present in Greenland’s so-called Dark Zone, where the ice is also melting. Normally ice reflects more than 80% of the sun’s radiation back into the atmosphere, but as algae appear, they darken the ice so that it absorbs the heat and melts more quickly. More algae appear as the ice melts more rapidly, giving them vital water and air and adding red hues to the white ice at the Passo Gavia, altitude 2,618 metres (8,590 feet). “Everything that darkens the snow causes it to melt because it accelerates the absorption of radiation,” said Di Mauro. “We are trying to quantify the effect of other phenomena besides the human one on the overheating of the Earth,” said Di Mauro, noting that the presence of hikers and ski lifts could also have an impact on the algae. Tourists at the glacier lament the impact of climate change. “Overheating of the planet is a problem, the last thing we needed was algae,” said tourist Marta Durante. “Unfortunately we are doing irreversible damage. We are already at the point of no return, I think.” Elisa Pongini from Florence said she felt the Earth was “giving us back everything we have done to it”. “2020 is a special year: terrible things have happened,” she said. “In my opinion, atmospheric phenomena are worsening. Climate change is increasingly evident.”"

Despite a blizzard of evidence that things were going to be bad, Washington DC just experienced its biggest snow‐​related fiasco since the infamous Commuteaggedon of January 2011. Largely to blame is the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which inexplicably did not delay the opening of the Federal Government, flooding the roadways with hundreds of thousands of very grumpy drivers. Given that most local employers and many school districts follow OPM’s lead, those commuters were not confined to federal workers.



DC’s morning headache is a direct result of “confirmation bias,” the all‐​too‐​human proclivity to hang on to a busting forecast, be it for tomorrow’s snowstorm or the global temperature in 2050, and a close examination of what is going on at both time scales provides a lesson for us all.



In weather‐​world, the view on the street was that a decent snowstorm in the Midwest was going to weaken in the 12‐​odd hours it took to get from central Illinois to the swamp on the Potomac, reducing local totals to the 1–2 inch range, with the District likely to be on the low, southern end.





Witness the power of confirmation bias.



Nonetheless, as the night before the storm wore on, evidence began to mount that neither were true. A band of decent snow, extending from south of Chicago to northeast of Cincinnati, was holding itself together and tracking directly for DC, instead of the more climatologically favored Charm City to our North.



What is really odd is the inaction of OMB, which consults with the National Weather Service local forecast office in Sterling, out by Dulles Airport. Their decision probably means that in their private consultations, the NWS discounted even their own forecast, because everyone with any experience in this area knows that even an inch of snow on a very cold surface — which we certainly were going to have — _will_ create a hellacious snarl if it just happens to coincide with the beginning of a commute.



The District of Columbia did the same. Their usual response to even the threat of a dusting is to paint the streets white with chemicals, but last night, not a truck was to be seen, even in the hilly neighborhoods. The only explanation, again, is that our “official” forecasters unofficially poo‐​poohed their own public prognostication. The same thing happened in Virginia, which is purported to use a private forecasting firm.



Why didn’t folks listen to the _Washington Post’_ s “Capital Weather,” which has a pretty sterling reputation around these parts? While they, too, forecast less than occurred, they were correctly adamant that hell‐​on‐​the‐​Beltway was a virtual certainty.



And still Pharaoh’s heart remained hard. Few plows were rumbling through the District, even as officially forecast totals were exceeded two hours into the storm (and, apparently, the “unofficial” forecast was busted after about sixty minutes). School buses skittered off the roads in Fairfax and Arlington counties. People fumed.



Witness the power of confirmation bias.



This kind of goof has implications for the current forecasts for the decades come. They’ve done about as well in the last two decades as this morning’s snow forecast and government’s response to it. As a family, the 100‐​odd climate models that the UN (and our government) uses are predicting about twice as much warming as is being observed (and _not_ predicting the now 18+ year standstill in global temperatures).



The evidence is there for all to see. But, thanks to confirmation bias, our government blunders on, in this case responding to a world‐​view of horrific climate change, and despite a mountain of evidence that it is being exaggerated.



Want proof? One of the constant memes of the federal “Global Change Research Program” (a $2.3 billion entity with apparent immortality) is that extreme events are increasing, along with their pernicious effects.



One of the most extreme effects of increasing heat waves in our cities should be “death,” right? But in the last two decades, even as our cities continue to warm thanks to their increasing congregation of pavement and buildings, the death rate in hot spells has dropped by over 60 per cent. You can even find that in the latest issue of _Environmental Health Perspectives_ , a largely alarmist journal that is bankrolled by the National Institutes of Health.



And so does the policy community’s heart also remained hardened, staggering on towards December’s UN climate summit in Paris, where it believes the world will adopt a serious, and internationally binding new climate treaty. Much like with the current snowstorm, and thanks again to confirmation bias, policymakers are going down the wrong road.

"In the midst of debates about how to best tackle the climate crisis, breastfeeding was recently highlighted as a significant way women can help to make a difference. But while there is no doubt of the important role breastfeeding can play, there must be caution in the way such messages are communicated.   This is because telling women that breastfeeding will help save the planet just further fuels feelings of anger, grief and loss women can experience when they are unable to breastfeed. The UK, for example, has some of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world, but that is not through lack of desire. Most women who want to breastfeed – but are unable to do so – have been affected by factors outside their control and are deeply frustrated at any message that implies they should just try harder.  Given these barriers, simply telling women that breastfeeding is important is unlikely to make any difference. Yet, there is a stark similarity in the way the climate and infant feeding crises are ineffectively communicated in the press – with emotive headlines about the need for individuals to take action.  Of course, as individuals we can all play our part, but real change is only possible with investment at a societal level. This is why government investment in breastfeeding is needed to make changes in policy, industry and the workplace to enable both a healthier planet and a healthier population.  The science surrounding breastfeeding and climate change is only just being revealed. Breastfeeding uses few water or land resources, produces no carbon emissions and minimal or zero waste. It suppresses ovulation, helping to reduce family sizes and keep families healthy, which can further protects the impact of humanity on the Earth’s resources.  Indeed, a recent study showed breastfeeding for six months saved 95-153kg CO₂e (carbon dioxide equivalents) per baby compared to formula feeding. If all babies were breastfed for just six months in the UK, the carbon emission savings would equate to removing between 50,000 and 77,500 cars from the road for a year. This data holds true, even when you take into consideration the small additional dietary demands of breastfeeding for the woman.  The water footprint of milk powder alone has been estimated at about 4,700 litres of water per kilo of milk powder. Formula is supplemented with multiple ingredients such as palm oil to approximate the minerals and vitamins required by babies for growth and development. Despite industry proclamations for greening of their supply chains, Nestlé’s accent recent temporary suspension from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil highlights potential deficiencies in sustainability in global food production.

      Palm oil boycott could actually increase deforestation – sustainable products are the solution


 There are only 40-50 formula milk processing plants worldwide. The food miles consumed in transporting raw ingredients to these plants, and transporting them to consumers worldwide is as yet unknown but obviously considerable.  Formula preparation also consumes resources. Powdered infant formula is not sterile, and can only be made safely with water heated to 70°C. In the UK, the estimated energy cost of boiling this water over the first year of a baby’s life equates to over 1.5m kilograms of carbon dioxide. And in terms of waste, research shows 550m infant formula cans, 86,000 tons of metal and 364,000 tons of paper are added to landfills every year – and the formula industry has more than doubled since that research was published in 2009.  Not breastfeeding also usually means a quicker return of women’s periods. Considering that in the UK, on average, each woman uses 264 pads and tampons each year, breastfeeding also reduces the number of cotton fibres, polyethylene plastics and contaminants being used for their production. There are of course obvious gaps in our knowledge across the whole sector that scientists must urgently address. But it’s clear that reducing our reliance on formula where possible is an important step in helping mitigate the climate crisis. But what use is that message in a system that fails to support breastfeeding mothers? Women need the right environment and support for breastfeeding to flourish. But despite continued messaging that this is how you raise breastfeeding rates, the government fails to sufficiently invest.  Ultimately, highlighting the role breastfeeding can play in protecting our planet is not a message that should be aimed at individual women. It should be aimed at those with the power to make a change. And for breastfeeding rates to increase, governments must invest in greater health professional support, cut down on the reach of the breast-milk substitute industry, ensure public spaces and workplaces have policies in place to enable women to breastfeed, and increase the maternity protections women need to meet the needs of their baby.  It also means ensuring that when formula milk is needed, it leaves the lowest possible environmental footprint. Strategies such as reducing reliance on ready-made formula and disposable bottles, stepping up to prevent so many resources being used on formula milk promotion – especially that of unnecessary follow on and toddler milks – and requiring the industry to be responsible for reducing its own impact such as making products recyclable would be critical steps that protect us all, no matter how people choose to feed their babies."

It is perhaps not impertinent to suggest that American constitutional theory and history, owing to the longevity of the document that is their subject, hold lessons for constitutionalism everywhere, but especially for European constitutionalism — the more recent and ever evolving treaties that serve as a “Constitutional Charter” for the European Union. An American constitutionalist looking east today, seeing everything from Brexit to Grexit plus the reactions in European capitals, must be struck by the tension in the EU between exclusion and inclusion in its many forms, including individualism and collectivism. Those themes underpin my discussion here. The issues surrounding them are universal. They are at the heart of the human condition.



In America we wrestled with them at our founding over 200 years ago, again in the aftermath of our Civil War, and yet again with the advent of Progressivism, which culminated in our New Deal constitutional revolution. And we are still wrestling with them. Because America was founded on philosophical principles — First Principles, coming from the Enlightenment — it is particularly appropriate that we look at that experience to shed such light as we can on this more recent European constitutional experience.



But my more immediate concern is this: In liberal democracies today — nations constituted in the classical liberal tradition — we see the same basic problem, albeit with significant variations. It is that the growth of government, responding mainly to popular demand, has raised seemingly intractable moral and practical problems. First, increasing intrusions on individual liberty; and second, the unwillingness of people to pay for all the public goods and services they are demanding. Therefore, governments borrow. And that has led to massive public debt that saddles our children and grandchildren, to bankruptcy, and to the failure of governments to keep the commitments they have made.



In Italy, we need only look east, to the birthplace of democracy. But Greece is not alone in this. Nor are we in America immune. Cities like Detroit have gone bankrupt. So too, just recently, has the American territory of Puerto Rico. The state of Illinois has a credit rating today just above junk status, and Connecticut and New Jersey, among other states, are not far behind. At the national level, America’s debt today exceeds $20 trillion — that’s trillion — more than double what it was only a decade ago. And our unfunded liability vastly exceeds that (Cogan 2018).



What has this to do with constitutionalism? A great deal. Constitutions are written, after all, to discipline not only the governments they authorize but the people themselves. The point was famously stated by James Madison ([1788] 1961), the principal author of the U.S. Constitution. “In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this,” he wrote: “you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself. A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government,” Madison concluded, “but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.”



The principal such precaution, of course, is a well‐​written constitution. But no constitution is self‐​executing. It is people who ultimately execute constitutions. In the end, therefore, the issue is cultural, a point I will come back to.



America’s Founders were deeply concerned with the problem of undisciplined, unlimited government. After all, they had just fought a war to rid themselves of distant, overbearing government. In drafting the Constitution, therefore, they were not about to impose that kind of government on themselves. In fact, during the ratification debates in the states, there were two main camps — the Anti‐​Federalists, who thought the proposed Constitution gave the government too much power, and the Federalists, who responded by pointing to the many ways the proposed Constitution would guard against that risk. The Federalists eventually won, of course, but the point I want to secure is that there was not a socialist in the group! There were _limited_ government people, the Federalists, and _even more_ limited government people, the Anti‐​Federalists.



So under a Constitution that has not changed that much, how did we go from limited to effectively unlimited government? The answer lies in the fundamental shift in the climate of ideas that began with Progressivism at the end of the 19th century, which the New Deal Supreme Court institutionalized in the 1930s. To illustrate that, I will first look closely at America’s founding documents: the Declaration of Independence, signed in 1776; the Constitution, ratified in 1788; the Bill of Rights, ratified in 1791; and the Civil War Amendments, ratified between 1865 and 1870, which corrected flaws in the original Constitution. Together, those documents constitute a legal framework for individual liberty under limited government, however inconsistent with those principles our actual history may have been.



I will then show how progressives rejected the libertarian and limited government principles of America’s Founders and how they eventually turned the Constitution on its head, not by amending it but through political pressure brought to bear on the Supreme Court. The problems that have ensued include the ones just noted: less liberty and increasing debt. But perhaps of even greater importance, for eight decades now the Supreme Court has struggled to square its post‐​New Deal decisions with the text and theory of the Constitution. That amounts to nothing less than a crisis of constitutional legitimacy.



And again, the basic reason for that crisis is the fundamental shift in outlook. Many Americans today no longer think of government as earlier generations did. Whereas the Founders saw government as a “necessary evil,” to be restrained at every turn, many today think that the purpose of government is to provide them with vast goods and services, as decided by democratic majorities.



I come, then, to the first important point I want to flag. You cannot understand the U.S. Constitution unless you understand the moral and political theory that stands behind it. And that was outlined not in the Constitution but in the Declaration of Independence (Sandefur 2015). The Constitution was written in a context, as were the later Civil War Amendments, and that context was one of natural law, Anglo‐​American common law, and even elements of Roman Law, all of which are captured succinctly in those famous words of the Declaration that I will quote in a moment. Indeed, President Abraham Lincoln’s famous Gettysburg Address, written in the throes of a brutal Civil War, begins with these words: “Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” Lincoln was reaching back to the Declaration, not to the Constitution.



Yet no less than my good friend and Italy’s gift to American constitutionalism, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, all but dismissed the Declaration as “philosophizing,” contrasting it with the Constitution’s “operative provisions” (Scalia 1997: 134). And his conservative colleague when the two served on the nation’s second highest court, the late Judge Robert Bork, wrote that “the ringing phrases [of the Declaration] are hardly useful, indeed may be pernicious, if taken, as they commonly are, as a guide to action, governmental or private” (Bork 1996: 57). Is it any wonder that there is constitutional confusion in America today when the document that is essential to understanding it plays little or no part in that understanding?



Let me now flesh out the argument by focusing on the underlying moral, political, and legal principles at stake, after which I will offer just a few reflections on how those principles might illuminate issues in the European context. Again, I want to show how the shift from limited to effectively unlimited government took place in America, despite very few constitutional changes. I should note, however, that it will be some time before I get to the Constitution. If a proper understanding of the Constitution requires a proper understanding of the theory behind it, and if that theory is found implicitly in the Declaration, then that should be our initial focus, and will be for some time. That will take us into some of the deeper reaches of moral and political theory, the aim being to better understand the Constitution itself — and especially the broad principles that underpin it.



The first thing to notice about the American constitutional experience is how relatively different its beginnings were from those of many other nations. Constitution making and remaking often take place in the context of a stormy history stretching back centuries, even millennia. By contrast, America was a _new_ nation. We came into being at a precise point in time, with the signing of the Declaration of Independence. To be sure, American patriots had to win our independence on the battlefield. And before that we had a colonial history of roughly 150 years. But America was created not by a discrete people but by diverse immigrants with unique histories all their own.



A second, crucial feature distinguishing America’s constitutional experience is that it unfolded during the intense intellectual ferment of the Enlightenment, including the Scottish Enlightenment, with its focus on the individual, individual liberty, and political legitimacy, all of which reflected the sense of “a new beginning.” Indeed, the motto on the Great Seal of the United States captures well the spirit of America’s origins: _Novus ordo seclorum_ , “a new order of the ages.”



Let us turn, then, to that new order, as outlined in the Declaration. Penned near the start of our struggle for independence, the Declaration in form is a _political_ document. But were it merely that, it would not have so endured in our national consciousness. Nor would it have inspired countless millions around the world ever since, leading many to leave their homelands to begin life anew under its promise, including millions from Italy who now enrich America. It has so inspired because, fundamentally, it is a profound _moral_ statement. Offered from “a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind” and invoking “the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God,” it was written not only to declare but to _justify_ our independence. And it did so not simply by listing the king’s “long Train of Abuses and Usurpations,” which constitute the greater part of the document, but by first setting forth the moral and political vision that rendered those acts unjust.



And so we come to those famous words that flowed from Thomas Jefferson’s pen in 1776, words that capture fundamental principles concerning the human condition:



We hold these Truths to be self‐​evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness — That to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed.



The first thing to notice about that passage is that its propositions are asserted as “truths,” not mere opinions. The Founders were not moral relativists. They were confident in their claims. And why not? Their truths were said to be “self‐​evident,” grounded in universal reason, accessible by all mankind — and the evidence supports that.



Notice too the structure of the passage: There are two parts — and the order is crucial. The moral vision comes first, defined by equal rights. The political and legal vision comes second, defined by powers, as derived from the moral vision. And right there is the second major point I want to flag: Unlike today, where politics, grounded in will, so often determines what rights we have, for early Americans, morality, grounded in reason, determined our rights. The Founders were concerned fundamentally with moral and political _legitimacy_. Rights first, government second, as the means for securing our rights (Barnett 2016, Pilon 1999).



Given that order of things, the Founders were engaged in “state‐​of‐​nature theory,” a rudimentary form of which can be found in the writings of Seneca (see Corwin 1955: 15). A fuller discussion came much later in the work of Thomas Hobbes (1651) and, especially, John Locke (1690) — often said to be the philosophical father of America.



State‐​of‐​nature theory is a thought experiment. The idea is to show how, without violating any rights, a legitimate government with legitimate powers might arise from a world with no government. Thus, the first step is to show, from pure reason, what rights we would have in such a world.



For that, as the Declaration implies, we turn to the natural law tradition — more precisely, the natural rights strain coming from the Reformation and the Enlightenment. Simply put, natural law stands for the idea that there is a “higher law” of right and wrong, grounded in reason, from which to derive the positive law, and against which to criticize that law at any point in time. There is nothing suspect about that idea, as modern moral skeptics argue. We appeal to natural law when the positive or actual law is thought to be morally wrong. In America, the abolitionists, the suffragists, and the civil rights marchers all invoked our natural rights in their struggles to overturn unjust law.



The origins of this law are in antiquity. Many of its particulars are in Roman Law, especially the law of property and contract. Over some 500 years in England, prior to the American Revolution, this law was refined and reduced to positive law by common‐​law judges consulting reason, custom, and what they knew of Roman Law as they adjudicated cases brought before them by ordinary individuals (Corwin 1955: 26; Leoni 1961). And John Locke drew largely on that body of common‐​law rights as he crafted a theory of natural rights, much as Jefferson drew on Locke when he drafted the Declaration.



To correct a common misunderstanding, these are the rights we hold _against each other_ , and would hold in a state of nature. Later, once we create a government, they will serve as rights we hold against that government, and likely be included in a bill of rights.



To discover and justify these rights in detail, as I and others have done (Pilon 1979; Epstein 2003), we would need to delve into the complex issues of moral epistemology and legal casuistry, and this is not the occasion for that. Suffice it to say that, when that foundational work is done, the conclusion one reaches is the same one America’s Founders reached through reason and experience — namely, that our basic right is the right to be free from the unjustified interference of others, and all other rights are derived from that basic right, as the facts may warrant. What results approximates largely the judge‐​made common law of property, torts, contracts, and remedies, a law that defines our private relationships, as it did in early America both before and long after the Revolution. It is a law that says, in essence, that each of us is free to pursue happiness, by his own subjective values, either alone or in association with others, provided we respect the equal objective rights of others to do the same. In short, it is a live‐​and‐​let‐​live law of liberty.



And I can summarize it with three simple rules, so simple that even a child can understand them.



There is a fourth rule, however, but it is optional: Do some good. You’re free not to be a Good Samaritan, but you should be one if you are a decent human being and the cost to you is modest. Unlike much continental law, Anglo‐​American law never compelled strangers to come to the aid of others (Ratcliffe 1966). It did not because individual liberty is its main object. And it saw that there is no virtue in forced beneficence. We are free to criticize those who don’t come to the aid of others, and we should, even as we defend their right not to.



Why have I mentioned this fourth, voluntary rule? Again, it is because, when we start from a theoretical state of nature, we need to know what rights we do and do not have for government to enforce once we bring government into the picture. And the Good Samaritan is the modern welfare state writ small. If there is no right to be rescued, there is no correlative obligation for government to enforce. Recognizing that raises important questions about the very legitimacy of the welfare state.1



To get to the Constitution, however, we need now to take the last step in the argument. We need to derive a legitimate government with legitimate powers — and that is no easy matter. I have said little about enforcement so far. The Declaration says that government’s purpose is to secure our rights, its _just_ powers derived “from the consent of the governed.” Thus, the Founders invoked the social contract, which grounds political legitimacy in consent.



But there are well‐​known problems with consent‐​based social‐​contract theory as a ground for political legitimacy. The question is how to move legitimately from self‐​rule to collective rule. Unanimity will achieve legitimacy, of course, but rarely if ever do we get it. Majoritarianism will not solve the problem, because it amounts to tyranny over the minority that has not consented. Nor will the social contract work, except for those in the original position who agree thereafter to be bound by the will of the majority. Nor, finally, will so‐​called tacit consent work — “you stayed, therefore you’re bound by the majority” — because it puts the minority to a choice between two of its rights, its right to stay where it is and its right not to be ruled by the majority, precisely what the majority must justify on pain of circularity. As for elections, an occasional vote hardly justifies all that follows.



As a _practical_ matter, the social contract argument may be the best we can do, but recognizing its infirmities leads to a compelling conclusion — and to the third basic point I want to flag, namely, that there is an air of illegitimacy that surrounds government as such. Government is not like a private association that we can join or leave at will. It is a _forced_ association. Its very definition entails force. And once we recognize its essential character, that should compel us, _from a concern for legitimacy_ , to do as much as we can through the private sector where it can be done voluntarily and hence in violation of the rights of no one, and as little as possible through the public sector where individuals will be forced into programs they may want no part of.



In short, as a _moral_ matter, there is a strong presumption against doing things through government. We should turn to government not as a first but only as a _last_ resort, when all else fails.



Still, we can refine this conclusion. We can distinguish three distinct powers in decreasing degrees of legitimacy. The first is the police power — the power, through adjudication or legislation, to more precisely define and enforce our rights. As such, it is bound by the rights we have to be enforced, although it includes the power to provide limited “public goods” like national defense, clean air, and certain infrastructure — goods described by nonexcludability and nonrivalrous consumption, as economists define them (Cowen 2008).



When we leave the state of nature, we give government that power to exercise on our behalf. But because we had the power in the state of nature — Locke called it the “Executive Power” each of us has to secure his rights — to that extent it is legitimate. Only the anarchist who would prefer to remain in the state of nature can be heard to complain. Fortunately, there are few of those.



Less legitimate is the eminent domain power — the power to condemn and take private property for public use after paying the owner just compensation — because none of us would have such a power in the state of nature. Such legitimacy as this power enjoys, at least in America, is because we gave it to government when we ratified the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which includes the Takings Clause; and it is “Pareto optimal,” as economists say, meaning that at least one person is made better off by its use — the public, as shown by its willingness to pay — and no one is made worse off — the owner, provided he is indifferent as to whether he keeps the property or receives the compensation, which he rarely is, unfortunately.



The third great governmental power, ubiquitous today, is the least legitimate. In fact, from a natural rights perspective, it enjoys no legitimacy. It is the redistributive power, and it takes two forms, material and regulatory. Through redistributive taxation, government takes from _A_ and gives to _B_. Through redistributive regulation, government prohibits _A_ from doing what he would otherwise have a right to do or requires him to do what he would otherwise have a right not to do, all for the benefit of _B_. Those powers describe the modern redistributive and regulatory state. No one would have them in the state of nature. How then could government get them legitimately, since governments, in the classical liberal tradition, get whatever powers they have from the people, who must first _have_ those powers to yield up to government?



There are three main answers. First, if that redistribution arose through unanimous consent, there would be no problem; but again, rarely if ever does that occur in the public domain. Second, majorities gave governments those powers. That raises the classic problem of the tyranny of the majority, as already mentioned. And third, special interests have learned how to work the system for their benefit, as public choice economists have long explained.2 That is the tyranny of the minority — and the main source today of such schemes.



We can conclude this examination of the moral foundations of the classical liberal vision by imagining a continuum, with anarchy or no government at one end — our state of nature — and totalitarianism at the other end, where everything possible is done through government. At the anarchy end, individuals are free to plan and live their lives as they wish, alone or in cooperation with others. They will soon find, however, that there are some things best done collectively, like the provision and enforcement of law, national defense, clean air and water, limited infrastructure, and the like — public goods — and most will consent to the public provision of such goods. But as we move up the continuum toward totalitarianism and try to bring more and more _private_ goods under _public_ provision — education, health care, child care, jobs, housing, ordinary goods and services — people start voting with their feet. The Berlin Wall was not built to keep West German workers out of the workers’ paradise to the east.



The moral, political, and legal vision implicit in the Declaration of Independence is closer to the anarchy end of that continuum. America’s Founders envisioned a land in which people were free to live as they wished, respecting the equal rights of others to do the same, with government there to secure those rights and do the few other things it was authorized to do.



That basic moral vision is perfectly universalizable. How to secure it through the rule of law is another matter. Certain basic legal principles are themselves universalizable and are common to most legal systems, but whether a nation has a parliamentary system as in much of Europe, or a republican form of government as in America, or some other arrangement is not a matter of natural law. Let us now see how the Founders framed a constitution to secure the Declaration’s moral vision.



After we declared independence, and during our struggle for it, we lived under our first constitution, the Articles of Confederation. As its name implies, it was a loose agreement among the 13 states, authorizing a national government that hardly warranted the name. Three main problems lay ahead. Surrounded on three sides by great European powers, our national defense was painfully inadequate. Second, states were erecting tariffs and other barriers to free interstate trade. And finally, our war debts remained unpaid. After 11 years, the Framers met in Philadelphia to draft a new Constitution.



The main problem they faced was how to strike a balance. They needed to give the new government enough power to address those problems and accomplish its broad aims, yet not so much power as to risk our liberties. Those aims were set forth in the Constitution’s Preamble:



We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.



Notice: states aside, regarding the proposed new government, we are right back in the state of nature, about to “ordain and establish” a constitution to authorize it and bring it into being. All power rests _initially_ with “we the people.” _We_ bring the constitution and the government that follows into being through ratification. _We_ give it its powers, such as we do. The government does not give us our rights. We already have our rights, natural rights, the exercise of which creates and empowers this government.



How, then, does Madison strike the balance between power and liberty in service of those aims? First, through federalism: Power was _divided_ between the federal and state governments, with most power left with the states, especially the general police power — the basic power of government to secure our rights, as just discussed. The powers we delegated to the federal government concerned national issues like defense, free interstate commerce, rules for intellectual property, a national currency, and the like.



Second, following Montesquieu, Madison _separated_ powers among the three branches of the federal government, with each branch defined functionally. Pitting power against power, he provided for a bicameral legislature, with each chamber constituted differently; a unitary executive to enforce national legislation and conduct foreign affairs; and an independent judiciary with the implicit power to review legislative and executive actions for their constitutionality — a novel institution at that time, and a crucial one as time went on.



Third, although the Constitution left most of the rules for elections with the states, it provided for periodic elections to fill the offices set forth in the document, thus leaving ultimate power with the people.



But while each of those provisions and others struck a balance between power and liberty, the main restraint on overweening government took the name of the _doctrine of enumerated powers_. And I can state it no more simply than this: if you want to limit power, don’t give it in the first place. We see that doctrine in the very first sentence of the Constitution, after the Preamble: “All legislative Powers _herein granted_ shall be vested in a Congress .…” By implication, not all powers were “herein granted.” Look at Article I, section 8, and you will see that Congress has only 18 powers or ends that the people have authorized. And the last documentary evidence from the founding period, the Tenth Amendment, states that doctrine explicitly: “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.” In other words, the Constitution creates a government of delegated, enumerated, and thus limited powers. If a power is not found in the document, it belongs to the states — or to the people, never having been given to either government.



As noted earlier, when the Constitution was sent out to the states for ratification, it met stiff resistance as Anti‐​Federalists thought it gave too much power to the national government. Only after the Federalists agreed to add a bill of rights was it finally ratified. During the first Congress in 1789, Madison drafted 12 amendments, 10 of which were ratified in 1791 as the Bill of Rights. That document sets forth rights that are good against the federal government, such as freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly, the right to keep and bear arms, to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures, to due process of law, to compensation if private property is taken for public use, to trial by jury, and more.



But it is important to note that the Bill of Rights was, as Justice Scalia (2017: 161) said, an “afterthought.” Unlike with many European constitutions, which begin with a long list of rights, many aspirational, the Framers saw the Constitution’s _structural_ provisions as their main protection against overweening government (National Lawyers Convention 2017). And on that score, it is crucial to mention the Ninth Amendment, which reads: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.”



The history behind that amendment is instructive. During the ratification debates, there were two main objections to adding a bill of rights. First, it would be unnecessary. “Why declare that things shall not be done,” asked Alexander Hamilton ([1788] 1961), “which there is no power to do?” Notice that he was alluding to the enumerated powers doctrine as the _main_ protection for our liberties: where there is no power, there is a right.



And second, it would be impossible to enumerate all of our rights, yet, by ordinary principles of legal construction,3 the failure to do so would be construed as implying that only those rights that were enumerated were meant to be protected. To guard against that, the Ninth Amendment was written. It reads, again, “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” Notice: “retained by the people.” You can’t retain what you don’t first have to be retained. The allusion is to our natural rights, which we retained when we left the state of nature, save for those we gave up to government to exercise on our behalf, like the right to enforce our rights.



For a proper understanding of the Constitution, the importance of the Ninth Amendment, which speaks of retained rights, and the Tenth Amendment, which speaks of delegated powers, cannot be overstated (Pilon 1991: 1). Taken together, as the last documentary evidence from the founding period, they recapitulate the vision of the Declaration. We all have rights, enumerated and unenumerated alike, to pursue happiness by our own lights, to plan and live our lives as we wish, provided we respect the rights of others to do the same; and federal and state governments are there to secure those rights through the limited powers we have given them toward that end. There, in a nutshell, is the American vision, reduced from natural to positive law.



But apart from our failure too often to abide by that vision, there was a structural problem with the original design. There were too few checks on the states, where most power was left. And the reason was slavery. To achieve unity among the states, the Framers made their Faustian bargain. They knew that slavery was inconsistent with their founding principles. They hoped it would wither away in time. It did not. It took a brutal civil war to end slavery and the Civil War Amendments to “complete” the Constitution by incorporating at last the grand principles of the Declaration, especially equality before the law (Reinstein 1993).



The Thirteenth Amendment, ratified in 1865, rendered slavery unconstitutional. The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870, protected the right to vote from being denied on account of race. And the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, defined federal and state citizenship and provided _federal_ remedies against a state’s violating the rights of its own citizens.4



Unfortunately, only five years after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, a deeply divided 5–4 Supreme Court eviscerated the principal font of substantive rights under the amendment, the Privileges or Immunities Clause.5 Thereafter the Court would try to do under the less substantive Due Process Clause what was meant to be done under privileges or immunities, and the misreading of the Fourteenth Amendment has continued to this day. Among other things, the upshot was Jim Crow racial segregation in the South, which lasted until the middle of the 20th century.



We turn now to the great ideological watershed, the rise of Progressivism at the end of the 19th century. Coming from the elite universities of the Northeast, progressives rejected the Founders’ libertarian and limited government vision (Pestritto and Atto 2008). They were social engineers, planners enamored of the new social sciences. Insensitive when not hostile to the power of markets to order human affairs justly and efficiently, they sought to address what they saw as social problems through redistributive regulatory legislation. They looked to Europe for inspiration: Bismarck’s social security scheme, for example, and British utilitarianism, which in ethics had replaced natural rights theory. The idea was that policy, law, and judgment were to be justified not by whether they protected our natural and moral rights but by whether they produced the greatest good for the greatest number — often by _giving_ rights to some, taken from others.



A particularly egregious example of that rationale concerned a sweetheart suit brought against a Virginia statute that authorized the sterilization of people thought to be of insufficient intelligence.6 Part of the bogus “eugenics” movement, the law was designed to improve the human gene pool. Writing for a divided Supreme Court in 1927, the sainted Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes upheld the statute, ending his short opinion with the ringing words, “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.” There followed some 70,000 sterilizations across the nation.



Some of what the progressives did was long overdue, like promoting municipal health and safety measures and attacking corruption. Yet they also sowed the seeds for later corruption, especially through regulatory schemes ripe for special interest capture, replacing markets with cartels (Epstein 2006). And their record on racial matters was abysmal (Sowell 2016).



During the early decades of the 20th century, progressives directed their political activism mostly at the state level, but they often failed as the courts upheld constitutional principles securing individual liberty and free markets. With the election of Franklin Roosevelt in 1932, however, progressive activism shifted to the federal level. Still, during the president’s first term the Supreme Court continued mostly to uphold limits on federal power, finding several of Roosevelt’s programs unconstitutional.



With the landslide election of 1936, however, things came to a head. Early in 1937, Roosevelt unveiled his infamous Court‐​packing scheme, his threat to pack the Court with six new members. Uproar followed. Not even an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress would go along with the plan. Nevertheless, the Court got the message. The famous “switch in time that saved nine” justices followed. The Court began rewriting the Constitution, in effect, not through amendment by the people, the proper way, but by reading the document as it hadn’t been read for 150 years — as authorizing effectively _unlimited_ government (Leuchtenburg 1995).



The Court did that rewrite in three basic steps. First, in 1937 it eviscerated the very centerpiece of the Constitution, the doctrine of enumerated powers. Then in 1938 it bifurcated the Bill of Rights and gave us a bifurcated theory of judicial review. Finally, in 1943 it jettisoned the nondelegation doctrine. Let me describe those steps a bit more fully so you can see the importance of recognizing and adhering to the theory that stands behind and informs a constitution.



The evisceration of the doctrine of enumerated powers involved three clauses in Article I, section 8, where Congress’s 18 legislative powers are enumerated: the General Welfare Clause, the Commerce Clause, and the Necessary and Proper Clause. All were written to be shields against government. The New Deal Court turned them into swords of government through which the modern redistributive and regulatory state has arisen.



The first of Congress’s enumerated powers, where the General Welfare Clause is found, authorizes Congress, in relevant part, to tax to provide for the “general Welfare of the United States.” As Madison wrote in _Federalist_ No. 41, that qualifying language was simply a general heading under which Congress’s 17 other powers or ends were subsumed, for which Congress may tax, but only if they serve the _general_ welfare _of the United States_ , not particular or local welfare.



Instead, the New Deal Court read the clause as an _independent_ power authorizing Congress to tax for whatever it thought might serve the “general welfare.”7 That reading could not be right, however, because it would enable Congress to tax for virtually any end, thus rendering Congress’s other powers superfluous, as Madison, Jefferson, and many others noted when the issue arose early in our history. Indeed, it would turn the Constitution on its head by allowing Congress effectively unlimited power. Such is the result from ignoring the document’s underlying theory of limited government.



Similar issues arose that year with the Commerce Clause, which in relevant part authorized Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Recall that, under the Articles of Confederation, states had begun erecting tariffs and other protectionist measures, and that was leading to the breakdown of free trade among the states. Thus, the Framers gave Congress the power to regulate — or _make regular_ — commerce among the states, largely by negating state actions that impeded free trade, but also through affirmative actions that might facilitate that end (Barnett 2001).



Over several decisions, however, beginning in 1937,8 the New Deal Court read the Commerce Clause as authorizing Congress to regulate anything that “affected” interstate commerce, which of course is virtually everything. Thus, in 1942 the Court held that, to keep the price of wheat high for farmers, Congress could limit the amount of wheat a farmer could grow, even though the excess wheat in question in the case never entered commerce, much less interstate commerce, but was consumed on the farm by the farmer and his cattle. The Court held that the excess wheat he consumed himself was wheat he would otherwise have bought on the market, so “in the aggregate” such actions “affected” interstate commerce.9 Such were the economic theories of the Roosevelt administration.



The last of Congress’s 18 enumerated powers authorizes it “to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.” Thus, the clause affords Congress _instrumental_ powers — the _means_ for executing its other powers or pursuing its other enumerated ends. “Necessary” and “proper” are words of limitation, of course: Not any means Congress desires will do. Yet the New Deal and subsequent Courts, until very recently, have hardly policed those limitations (Blumstein 2012: 86).10



Turning now to the second step, despite the demise in 1937 of the doctrine of enumerated powers, one could still invoke one’s rights against Congress’s expanded powers. So to address that “problem,” the New Deal Court added a famous footnote to a 1938 opinion.11 In it, the Court distinguished two kinds of rights: “fundamental,” like speech, voting, and, later, certain personal rights; and “non‐​fundamental,” like property rights and rights we exercise in “ordinary commercial relations.” If a law implicated fundamental rights, the Court would apply “strict scrutiny” and the law would likely be found unconstitutional.12 By contrast, if nonfundamental rights were at issue, the Court would apply the so‐​called rational basis test, which held that if there were _some_ reason for the law, if you could _conceive_ of one, the law would be upheld. Thus was economic liberty reduced to a second‐​class status. None of this is found in the Constitution, of course. The Court invented it from whole cloth to make the world safe for the New Deal programs (Pilon 2003).



Finally, in 1943 the Court jettisoned the nondelegation doctrine,13 which arises from the very first word of the Constitution: “ _All_ legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress .…” Not some; all. As government grew, especially during the New Deal, Congress began delegating ever more of its legislative power to the executive branch agencies it was creating to carry out its programs. Some 450 such agencies exist in Washington today. Nobody knows the exact number.



That is where most of the law Americans live under today is written, in the form of regulations, rules, guidance, and more, all issued to implement the broad statutes Congress passes. Not only is this “law” written, executed, and adjudicated by unelected, non‐​responsible agency bureaucrats — raising serious separation‐​of‐​powers questions — but the Court has developed doctrines under which it defers to _agencies_ ’ interpretations of statutes, thus largely abandoning its duty to oversee the political branches. Governed largely today under administrative law promulgated by the modern executive state, we are far removed from the limited, accountable government envisioned by the Founders and Framers (Hamburger 2014, 2017).



This completes my overview of American constitutional theory and history. From it, as I mentioned early on, the main lesson to be drawn is that culture matters. The Founders and Framers were animated by individual liberty under limited government. When the post–Civil War Framers revised our original federalism, they did it the right way, by amending the Constitution to make it consistent with its underlying moral and political principles. The New Deal politicians, having less regard for the Constitution and its underlying principles, rejected that course, choosing instead to browbeat the Court into effectively rewriting the Constitution, undermining its moral and political principles in the process.



But don’t take my word for it. Here is Franklin Roosevelt (1935), writing to the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee: “I hope your committee will not permit doubts as to constitutionality, however reasonable, to block the suggested legislation.” And here is Rexford Tugwell (1968: 20), one of the principal architects of the New Deal, reflecting on his handiwork some 30 years later: “To the extent that these [New Deal policies] developed, they were tortured interpretations of a document intended to prevent them.” They knew exactly what they were doing. They were turning the Constitution on its head.



Thus, the problem today is not, as so many America progressives think, too little government. It is too much government, intruding on our liberties and driving us ever deeper into debt. And it isn’t as if our Founders did not understand that. As Jefferson famously wrote, “The natural progress of things is for liberty to yield, and government to gain ground” (Boyd 1956: 208–10). The remedy for that “progress” is a good constitution, but it must be followed. And that takes good people at every stage — including, ultimately, the people themselves.



So what lessons might we draw from the American experience for European constitutionalism? Recall my mentioning earlier of being struck by the tension in the EU between exclusion and inclusion in its many forms, including individualism and collectivism. As we have seen, that same tension runs through America’s constitutional history as well. To address deficiencies in the Articles of Confederation, the original Constitution moved toward greater inclusion to form “a more perfect Union.” But the resulting federalism did not get the balance right either. It left too much power with the states, enabling the southern states to continue enforcing slavery. So the Civil War Amendments increased the inclusion, correctly. The adjusted federalism gave more power to the federal government, enabling it to block states from oppressing their own citizens — a higher power checking a subsidiary power.



But that balance, reflecting the nation’s underlying principles, was upended again by the far more inclusive New Deal constitutional revolution. Giving vastly more power to the federal government, contrary to the nation’s limited government principles, this change swept ever more Americans into public programs, leading many to want out. They wanted to be _excluded_ from the socialization of life, as reflected by the rise of the conservative and libertarian movements in the second half of the 20th century.



Are there parallels with post‐​War developments in Europe? To this sometime‐​student of European affairs, there seem to be; but the inclusion that began with the 1951 Treaty of Paris and continued through the many treaties since makes it difficult if not impossible to speak of three distinct periods, as in America, much less point to a “golden mean” in this evolution akin to America’s post–Civil War settlement. In recent years, however, the impetus toward exclusion, in many forms, is unmistakable, Brexit being only the most prominent example, the ongoing refugee resettlement crisis being another.



Federalism _within_ nations is a delicate balance. Federalism _among_ sovereign nations, which is what the EU amounts to, is far more difficult, especially when cultural differences loom large. And on that score, here is a paradox. Europeans have always been more comfortable than Americans with collectivization in the form of the welfare state, certainly within their respective nations (Rhodes 2018). But with collectivization _among_ nations, cultural differences — rich and poor being only one axis — can easily exacerbate the cooperation that is required if collectivization is to work at all, much less with any measure of efficiency. The evidence suggests that the EU has gone too far in that direction. At the same time, the evidence is equally clear that the failure to make EU border security an EU responsibility, leaving it instead to individual members, has raised serious problems, too (Rohac 2016).



In America, border security became a federal government function once the Constitution was ratified. Within our borders, however, to keep states honest, the Founders instituted _competitive_ federalism, whereby states compete for the allegiance of citizens; and it has largely worked as states with high taxes and excessive regulations lose firms and people to states with low taxes and reasonable regulations. People vote with their feet, much as in the Schengen Area. But the federal income tax plus the direct election of senators, both enacted as constitutional amendments in 1913 and both promoted by progressives, unleashed _cooperative_ federalism whereby federal and state officials collude, using federal funds and enacting federal regulations, to undercut state autonomy and the discipline that competitive federalism was meant to secure (Greve 2012; Buckley 2014).



Earlier I said that you cannot understand the American Constitution unless you understand the theory behind it. Well, what is the theory behind the treaties that compose the EU Constitution? Peace through trade and cooperation, yes — given Europe’s long history of wars. But beyond that, what? We have seen how a radical shift in the climate of ideas in America, especially in the direction of collectivism, has led, as many lonely voices predicted, to a reaction that today reflects a deeply divided nation, unable to restrain its appetite for “free” goods and services, even in the face of crushing debt. The divisions surfacing recently in Europe are no accident. People and peoples yearn to breathe free — in an earlier understanding of that idea. The balance needed to ensure that freedom may be difficult to find. But to discover it, as we celebrate Italy’s Constitution today and reflect on Italy’s place within the larger European Community, we could do no better than to repair to the First Principles that are the very foundation of civilized nations.

"**Facebook's ""vexing and heartbreaking"" decisions are causing significant setbacks for civil rights, an audit commissioned by the company says.**
The two-year-long review says its actions have left many activists ""disheartened, frustrated and angry"".
Facebook has already said it will make some - but not all - of the changes called for in the 100-page report.
The official number of advertisers boycotting Facebook over its civil-rights policy is now at nearly 1,000.
Facebook commissioned the review in May 2018, a month after founder Mark Zuckerberg faced intense questioning at a congressional hearing.
""With each success, the auditors became more hopeful that Facebook would develop a more coherent and positive plan of action that demonstrated, in word and deed, the company's commitment to civil rights,"" it says.
""Unfortunately, in our view Facebook's approach to civil rights remains too reactive and piecemeal.
""Many in the civil rights community have become disheartened, frustrated and angry after years of engagement where they implored the company to do more to advance equality and fight discrimination, while also safeguarding free expression.""
But the audit report also praises Facebook for progress in some areas, such as its improved consultations with rights groups.
Facebook said the report was ""the beginning of the journey, not the end"".
""What has become increasingly clear is that we have a long way to go,"" it said.
""As hard as it has been to have our shortcomings exposed by experts, it has undoubtedly been a really important process for our company.""
The auditors also referenced Facebook's decision to allow a controversial post from US President Donald Trump to remain on the platform.
""When it means that powerful politicians do not have to abide by the same rules that everyone else does, a hierarchy of speech is created that privileges certain voices over less powerful voices,"" the report says.
It calls for:
""This report outlines a number of positive and consequential steps that the company has taken but at this point in history, the auditors are concerned that those gains could be obscured by the vexing and heartbreaking decisions Facebook has made that represent significant setbacks for civil rights,"" it adds.
Chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said the audit had already had a ""profound effect"" on the company and Facebook had already acted on many of its recommendations.
""While we won't be making every change they call for, we will put more of their proposals into practice soon,"" she said.
She also noted that two years ago, the company could not have predicted the audit would be published at a time of a major advertising boycott of Facebook.
Organisers of the boycott said a meeting with Facebook's senior management this week, including Ms Sandberg and Mr Zuckerberg, had been ""disappointing"".
""It was abundantly clear in our meeting today that Mark Zuckerberg and the Facebook team is not yet ready to address the vitriolic hate on their platform,"" the Stop hate for Profit group said, adding the company would not respond directly to the demands of the boycott.
And it accused Mr Zuckerberg of offering ""the same old defence"" society had ""heard too many times before"".
""Facebook wants us to accept the same old rhetoric, repackaged as a fresh response,"" it said.
Color of Change president Rashad Robinson also said the meeting ""was a disappointment"".
**By James Clayton, North America technology reporter**
This audit is grim reading for Facebook.
What makes it so significant is the report looks at whether Facebook itself is driving people towards extremism.
""Facebook should do everything in its power to prevent its tools and algorithms from driving people toward self-reinforcing echo chambers of extremism,"" it says.
And that is not just a criticism there is nasty stuff on the platform.
It is criticism the platform itself may drive hate.
Failure to act can have dangerous and life-threatening real-world consequences, the report says.
And it will add momentum to the Facebook ads boycott that had gone a bit quiet over the past few days.
Meanwhile, it has emerged Facebook's much-lauded oversight board will not now launch until late-autumn. The board will be an independent body that can decide what kind of content can and cannot be on Facebook - with the power to overrule the company's own decisions.
When asked, the Oversight Board Administration said the tweet did not necessarily mean the start date would be after the US Presidential election on 3 November.
""There has been no change to the oversight board's timing for becoming fully operational, and we expect it to begin its work in the coming months,"" it told the BBC.
""No effort is being made to avoid any particular event, and the board aims to begin its work as early as possible. No exact date can be set yet as the technical and operational systems are still being set up."""
"In the waning days of this year’s Affordable Care Act   period, the Trump administration declared war on the health law, releasing an executive order that could weaken its requirements and yanking advertisements and outreach off the air. Those actions appear to have made a difference.   for health plans in the states managed by the federal government are down slightly compared with last year. About 9. 2 million Americans picked an Obamacare marketplace plan for this year, according to a government report released Friday. Last year, that number was 9. 6 million. The decline by itself isn’t that meaningful, but several snapshots over previous months had shown that   were on track to overtake last year’s enrollment. It was only in the final two weeks of enrollment, when there’s typically a   surge, that the numbers dropped. Fewer than 400, 000 people signed up for Obamacare plans over the last two weeks. Last year, more than 700, 000 people signed up in the last week alone. The falloff suggests that Trump administration actions may have confused consumers, discouraged them from enrolling or simply made it easier to forget about the deadline. So far, the numbers do not show that the markets are failing, or in the “death spiral” that Mr. Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan have often mentioned. But they show how important signaling is, and how confused the signaling currently is. Mr. Trump’s executive order, signed on the day of his inauguration, was widely reported as eliminating the law’s requirement to buy insurance. (I differ with that view.) And the reductions in outreach may have prevented some people who intended to sign up from getting the reminder that they needed. More broadly, promises from Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress to quickly repeal Obamacare may have caused some people to think the law was no longer in effect at all. My colleagues Abby Goodnough and Robert Pear spoke with   counselors around the country, who said many of their customers assumed that Obamacare would be repealed soon. Premiums were substantially higher this year than last in many places, and it’s possible that those high prices also depressed  . But most Obamacare customers do not pay full price for their plans, so they do not feel the increases. Full national   numbers won’t be released until next month. The 9. 2 million   reported Friday come only from states that use the federal government’s website to select plans.   appear to be up in a few states using their own system. Of course, some people who signed up during the enrollment period may drop out of coverage or simply fail to pay their premiums, meaning the number of people who will be covered in Obamacare plans is likely to be lower than the current numbers. Moreover, people who signed up early for plans because they thought it was required may drop coverage if they come to believe they will face no penalty. That’s why the future health of Obamacare’s markets will depend largely on what the Trump administration and Congress do next. That path is hard to predict. After a week of steps that appeared to undermine the Obamacare markets, the Trump administration appeared to change course. Some of the canceled outreach was restored. And a new regulation, currently under review by the Office of Management and Budget, is expected to help stabilize the health insurance markets  —   though it’s hard to be sure until it is published. Yet on Friday, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services  —   the agency still responsible for administering Obamacare  —   issued a statement that adopted the harshest tones of Mr. Trump. “Obamacare has failed the American people, with one broken promise after another,” said the spokesman, Matt Lloyd. “We look forward to providing relief to those who are being harmed by the status quo. ” A rapid Obamacare repeal is looking increasingly unlikely. Mr. Trump reaffirmed this morning that health care legislation is high on his priority list, but Congress’s efforts have largely stalled. The Trump administration may want to keep things calm in the interim. If so, it will probably take more steps to reassure anxious insurers and customers. Or it may decide that further chaos will help encourage congressional action. If Mr. Trump’s preference is the former, he may learn from this week’s news that his words matter."

"A federal judge in Seattle on Friday temporarily blocked President Trump’s   immigration order from being enforced nationwide, reopening America’s door to visa holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries and dealing the administration a humbling defeat. The White House vowed late Friday to fight what it called an “outrageous” ruling, saying it would seek an emergency halt to the judge’s order as soon as possible and restore the president’s “lawful and appropriate order. ” “The president’s order is intended to protect the homeland and he has the constitutional authority and responsibility to protect the American people,” the White House said. A revised statement released later omitted the word “outrageous. ” And early Saturday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted in defense of his stand. Courts around the country have halted aspects of Mr. Trump’s temporary ban on travel from the seven countries, but the Seattle ruling was the most   to date. Airlines that had been stopping travelers from boarding planes to the United States were told by the government in a conference call Friday night to begin allowing them to fly, according to a person familiar with the call but who declined to be identified because it was a private discussion. The Trump administration, however, could again block the travelers if it were to win an emergency stay. The federal government was “arguing that we have to protect the U. S. from individuals from these countries, and there’s no support for that,” said the judge, James Robart of Federal District Court for the Western District of Washington, an appointee of President George W. Bush, in a decision delivered from the bench. The judge’s ruling was temporary, putting Mr. Trump’s policy on hold at least until the government and opponents of the order had a chance to make full arguments, or until the administration won a stay. “What we’re seeing here is the courts standing up to the unconstitutional ban that President Trump imposed,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project at the A. C. L. U. “There’s obviously more litigation to come, but this is truly good news for the many people both in this country and abroad who have been unfairly targeted on the basis of their religion by this ban. ” It is not unusual for district courts to issue nationwide injunctions blocking executive actions, and the federal government must obey such injunctions even when other district courts have declined to issue injunctions in similar cases. Judge Robart temporarily barred the administration from enforcing two parts of Mr. Trump’s order: its   suspension of entry into the United States of people from the seven countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   and its limits on accepting refugees, including “any action that prioritizes the refugee claims of certain religious minorities. ” The order had suspended admissions of any refugees for 120 days, and of Syrian refugees indefinitely. The goal, the president said, was to evaluate the process for vetting refugees and other immigrants in order to safeguard the country against terrorism. The order said that when immigration from the seven countries resumed, persecuted religious minorities would be given preference, and in an interview the day of the signing, Mr. Trump said the United States would give Christians from those countries priority because they had suffered “more so than others. ” Judge Robart made clear that his order applied nationwide, citing a similar nationwide injunction from a federal district court in Texas that had blocked President Barack Obama’s plan to shield some undocumented immigrants from deportation and allow them to legally work in the United States. Since Mr. Trump signed his order on Jan. 27, there has been widespread confusion over the policy and disagreement over how it was being carried out, flummoxing immigration lawyers, government officials and travelers. Shortly before the Seattle ruling, a different federal judge, Nathaniel M. Gorton in Boston, ruled in favor of the government by declining to extend a temporary halt to the order in that jurisdiction. Judge Gorton, who was appointed to the bench by the first President George Bush, said that while the nation’s immigration history was a source of great pride and that the plaintiffs in that case  —   Iranian nationals who are academics  —   had compelling stories, “the public interest in safety and security in this ever more dangerous world is strong as well. ” But that ruling was soon rendered moot, at least for now, by the Seattle ruling. The administration has been criticized for issuing its order without any warning to refugees and visa holders who were on their way to the United States. Some arrived at airports for flights and were turned away. The president’s order allowed for exceptions in the “national interest,” but lawyers for some travelers had described getting one as a Kafkaesque exercise, with the State Department’s website warning that no emergency applications would be heard, and Customs and Border Protection agents at United States airports all but unreachable because their clients were not being allowed to board planes. “It’s quite clear it was not all that thought out,” Judge Leonie Brinkema of Federal District Court in Alexandria, Va. said in yet another court hearing held Friday. “As a result there has been chaos. ” Protests over the policy continued on Friday, including a large group that gathered in a parking lot of Kennedy International Airport in New York for the Friday Prayer. One big question surrounded the number of people who were affected by the travel ban. Besides barring refugees and other visa holders from the seven countries from entering the United States, the administration also revoked, at least temporarily, all visas from the seven countries, including those for people currently living in the United States. The revocations, which were not publicly announced but were revealed during court proceedings, meant that anyone who lost their visa would be unable to   the United States if they left. In the Virginia courtroom, spectators gasped when a lawyer for the government told Judge Brinkema, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, that more than 100, 000 visas had been revoked as part of Mr. Trump’s order. A State Department official later contradicted that number, saying that it mistakenly included diplomatic visas that were untouched by the ban as well as expired visas. The true figure was “fewer than 60, 000,” said William Cocks, a spokesman for the department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs. “To put that number in context, we issued over 11 million immigrant and nonimmigrant visas in fiscal year 2015,” he said in a statement. Because the court fights so far have centered on whether judges should impose and keep in place temporary restraining orders, the legal arguments in the last few days have centered on the government’s contention that there is “no potential irreparable harm” to justify keeping the extraordinary orders in place pending fuller briefing and arguments. But Bob Ferguson, the Washington attorney general, who opposed the Trump administration in the Seattle case, said the decision Friday “shuts down the executive order nationwide and immediately. ” “I hope the federal government will understand what they did was unconstitutional and unlawful,” he said."
"**The taking down of a viral video by social media companies has reignited a highly-charged controversy in the US over the use of the anti-malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine.**
In the video, members of the group America's Frontline Doctors promote it both as a preventative measure and as a cure for Covid-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) say ""there is currently no proof"" that hydroxychloroquine is effective as a treatment or prevents coronavirus.
The video was broadcast online by right-wing online platform Breitbart, viewed over 17 million times on Facebook. It was also shared on Twitter by Donald Trump and many of his supporters.
The president's son, Donald Jnr, was suspended from tweeting for 12 hours by Twitter after he posted it on his account.
The video, a 45-minute livestream of the first day of a ""White Coat"" summit by the group, was posted to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube by Breitbart and quickly went viral.
""The virus has a cure, it's called hydroxychloroquine, zinc, and Zithromax,"" says one of the doctors in the video.
""You don't need masks. There is a cure. I know they don't want to open schools. No, you don't need people to be locked down. There is prevention and there is a cure.""
The Facebook video, as well as racking up millions of views, was shared nearly 600,000 times before it was taken down.
The hashtag #hydroxychloroquine was tweeted more than 153,000 times, becoming one of Twitter's top trends in the US overnight.
Multiple versions of the video continue to be widely shared on social media.
According to data from the Facebook-owned social media analytics tool CrowdTangle, public posts in the last 24 hours containing the word hydroxychloroquine have had 6.6 million engagements (likes, shares, views, comments and reactions) on Facebook and Instagram despite the removal of several versions of the video.
In a statement to BBC News, Twitter said: ""Tweets with the video are in violation of our Covid-19 misinformation policy. We are taking action in line with our policy here.""
""We've removed this video for sharing false information about cures and treatments for Covid-19,"" Facebook told the BBC, confirming it was also removing other versions of the video.
YouTube told the BBC: ""We have removed the video for violating our Covid-19 misinformation policies.""
BBC News also approached Breitbart, the White House and America's Frontline Doctors for comment.
The drug is a well-known treatment for malaria and was first touted by President Trump in March in connection with Covid-19.
The WHO says: ""While several drug trials are ongoing, there is currently no proof that hydroxychloroquine or any other drug can cure or prevent COVID-19.""
""The misuse of hydroxychloroquine can cause serious side effects and illness and even lead to death,"" it adds.
A study conducted by Oxford University found the drug was not effective against Covid-19 in hospitalised patients.
Its effectiveness when used early on during treatment is still being studied, as is its use as a preventative measure.
Medical trials have so far been inconclusive and the results of larger-scale randomised studies will be needed to know if it's effective or not.
In July, the US Food and Drug Administration warned against the use of the drug outside a hospital setting because of possible risks to the heart from taking it.
America's Frontline Doctors is a collection of physicians critical of the scientific consensus around the pandemic. Their event was backed by the Tea Party Patriots, a conservative organisation seeking to re-elect President Trump.
Its founder, Simone Gold, organised a letter to Mr Trump calling for an end to lockdown measures in May.
Participants were encouraged to seek out interviews with social media influencers as the best way to connect with Americans.
There has been intense debate on social media in recent months about hydroxychloroquine, and influential Fox News anchors have also run segments favouring the drug.
Ralph Norman, a Republican member of the House of Representatives, was standing alongside the doctors when they delivered their news conference.
The debate has been increasingly dividing Americans along political lines, with proponents of hydroxychloroquine pointing to President Trump's support of it while accusing critics of covering up its potential effectiveness.

Route of MV Akademik Shokalskiy Image: Voice of America
Today, while shopping at lunchtime for some last minute year end supplies, I got one of the strangest cell-phone calls ever. It was from my friend John Coleman, the founder of the Weather Channel and Chief meteorologist at KUSI-TV in San Diego. He was calling via cell phone from his car, and he was on his way into the TV station early.
He started off by saying, “Anthony, we have a really strange situation here”.
Then to my surprise, he relayed a conversation he had just had; a person on the Akademik Shokalskiy had reached out, because they didn’t have adequate weather data on-board. At first, I thought John was pulling my leg, but then as he gave more details, I realized he was serious. 
What had happened was that the US Coast Guard had received a message from the ship, requesting weather and wind information for Antarctica. That got relayed to someone at the Scripps oceanographic Institute in San Diego, and it went to John’s weekend KUSI meteorologist Dave Scott. Dave had worked with a scientist who is now on the US Coast Guard IceBreaker Polar Star, and they had logged the request for weather for forecast data from Akademik Shokalskiy. That’s how all this got started.
The message was that they needed better weather information on the ship than they had, specifically about wind and how it might affect the breakup of sea ice. John asked me to gather everything I had on the area and send it, and also to help him contact Joe D’Aleo of WeatherBell Analytics, because somehow John’s cellphone had gotten stuck into some sort of “private caller” mode and Joe wasn’t answering his phone due to how the incoming call looked.
My first thought was that no matter how much we’ve been criticizing the expedition for its silliness, that if such a request had reached all the way from Antarctica to me, I’d do everything I could to help.
I told John “give me 15 minutes”, which was about the time I’d need to get out of COSTCO and get back to my office and send along some things I knew would help.
I immediately called Joe D’Aleo at WeatherBell, who was as incredulous as I at the request, and asked him to call John Coleman right away. I explained to him that we had to remember that we were dealing with a Russian ship, not a military ship, but a charter vessel and they likely didn’t have all the tools that American meteorologists had and may not even know where to look for better data. I also pointed out that the Australian scientists on-board were climatologists, and not operational weather forecasters, and finding this sort of weather data probably wasn’t in their skill set.
Joe started working from the WeatherBell end, I finished my shopping and headed back to the office. As I drove, I started thinking about the situation with the ship there. They had wind compressing the ice into shore, with the Akademik Shokalskiy in the middle, and the wind wasn’t changing. They needed a wind shift in order to ease the pressure on the ice but they had no idea when that might happen. It was a waiting game, and as we know, the longer a ship remains trapped in sea ice, the greater its chances of having a hull breach due to the pressure.
I knew just what to send, because it was something that had been discussed several times by commenters on WUWT.
When I got back to the office, I no more than pulled up the bookmark and press send on the email with a brief description of the operational weather data model that covered the region and John Coleman was on the phone again. He asked me to talk to Dave Scott and explain what I had just sent over. I called Dave immediately and relayed the email.
I sent a live link that provided this image of Antarctica, and I noted in a Tweet about the same time:


Just had a request for Antarctic wind and FC data come up via Scripps from #spiritofmawson ship. KUSI, WeatherBell, WUWT all happy to help.

Dave listened intently to my explanation and then thanked me saying “this is exactly what we need”. I then started to do some research into the extensive library of operational forecast products put together by our friend Dr. Ryan Maue of WeatherBell which can be seen at http://models.weatherbell.com/  About that same time I get a new email from Joe D’Aleo, and he had sorted out the maps needed and had sent an email to John, Dave, and I.
In a couple of minutes John Coleman was back on the phone to me, he wanted my assessment of the maps. I had looked at what was happening and saw what I thought might be an opening in 7-8 days based on the forecast graphics from WeatherBell, where the winds would shift to offshore in the area where Akademik Shokalskiy was stuck. Like we discussed in the WUWT post yesterday Polynyas are very important for marine life and cooling the oceans I had hoped that a coastal polyna might open up near the ship. We also discussed the possibility of a low pressure system passing nearby that might help break up the ice. I didn’t express much hope for that.
The problem is that they are in a catch-22 now, they need strong offshore winds to help blow the sea ice out to open water, but at the same time they need calm or light winds for a safe helicopter rescue.
John Coleman and Dave Scott put together a video news story which ran on the KUSI 6PM News tonight. I was interviewed for the story, and you can watch it here:

http://www.kusi.com/video?clipId=9686594&autostart=true
Watching the wind is the key to the way out of the situation the Akademik Shokalskiy is in. This near real-time wind model is worth watching, and it updates every three hours with new observations, click on the image to start it.

http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/isobaric/1000hPa/orthographic=144.30,-66.68,3000
Note the green circle marker, which is the approximate location the Akademik Shokalskiy is at. Winds are running parallel to the coast, and pushing ice up against the edge of the Commonwealth Bay.
Despite the irony and folly of the situation, I’m sure readers will join me in the hope that everyone makes it off the ship safely, whether it is by helicopter or by the ship being freed from the ice.

"BAGHDAD  —   The Trump administration amended its visa ban on Thursday to allow emigration by the families of Iraqi interpreters who served the United States government and military forces deployed in their country. The change, recommended by the Pentagon, eased some of the anger generated in Iraq by President Trump’s executive order imposing the ban, which has stoked anxiety and confusion around much of the world since it was issued last week. The order temporarily blocked all Syrian refugees from entering the United States and suspended visas for applicants from seven   countries, including Iraq. It applied to holders of   Special Immigrant Visas issued to interpreters who worked for the United States during its   occupation, often at great personal risk, and to their families. In a statement about the change sent to The New York Times, a United States Embassy official in Baghdad said, “The U. S. government has determined that it is in the national interest to allow Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (S. I. V.) holders to continue to travel to the United States. ” Iraqis who have received the visas, the statement said, may use them, and the “U. S. Embassy in Baghdad will continue to process and issue S. I. V.s to applicants who are otherwise qualified. ” For the family of a    Iraqi who once worked as an interpreter for American forces, the news was a joyous surprise after nearly a week of upended travel plans. An embassy official called to inform family members that they were again permitted to fly to the United States. “I’m shocked all over again,” said the former interpreter, who asked to be identified only by his first name and an initial, Munther A. to protect relatives in Iraq. The travel ban has thrown the lives of many former interpreters in Iraq into turmoil. Even with valid visas in hand, some were refused entry at American airports and others were removed from planes scheduled to fly to the United States. There was also confusion because the executive order, at least initially, barred entry to Iraqis who held American green cards. Many of them, but not all, were eventually permitted to enter the United States. The Pentagon recommended that the White House exempt from the travel ban Special Immigrant Visa holders and others who had demonstrated their commitment to American military forces. Munther A. and his family were removed from a Turkish Airlines flight in Istanbul on Saturday just as they had settled into their seats for a scheduled flight to Kennedy Airport. They were forced to fly back to Baghdad, he said. Most Iraqis holding the special visas have sold their homes, cars and other possessions in anticipation of starting a new life in the United States. Munther A. said his family had been forced to find emergency housing with friends in Baghdad. Since 2007, the State Department has issued more than 1, 700 Special Immigrant Visas to Iraqi interpreters and their family members. The embassy in Baghdad did not disclose the number of Iraqis affected by the change in the Trump administration’s visa ban. Only 19 such visas were issued to Iraqi interpreters and their families during the past three years, according to State Department figures. Mr. Trump said when he issued the executive order that it was intended to allow American officials to vet Iraqis and others more thoroughly. But the interpreters had extensive security vetting before they were permitted to accompany American forces. They spent years clearing more background security checks while applying for the special visas. Even after the phone call from the embassy, Munther A. and his family were initially turned away by airline officials in Baghdad on Thursday as they tried to board a connecting flight to Doha, Qatar. He called a telephone number provided by the embassy, he said, and the problem was resolved. “We’re getting on the flight now,” Munther A. said in a telephone interview from the Baghdad airport late Thursday afternoon. He said his    daughter was in tears on Saturday because the canceled flight meant she would not be able to visit Disneyland, as her father had promised. “I told her she’s going now,” Munther A. said. Thousands of interpreters, known to the troops as “terps,” rode for years with American forces on combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. They were given American nicknames like Tony and Bobby and Max. They often wore scarves across their faces to mask their identities. They risked their lives as the eyes and ears of the American military in Iraq. They did far more than just interpret, guiding American soldiers and commanders through Iraqi politics, tribal disputes and social customs. Other Iraqis who assisted the American military or government in Iraq indirectly remained in limbo on Thursday. Many had received refugee visas to resettle in the United States with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration, but they were blocked by the travel ban this week. A    Iraqi father of two who worked seven years for a contractor that supplied American troops said he and his family had been granted visas for relocation to Charlotte, N. C. after passing extensive security checks. They were scheduled to fly from Iraq to the United States on Thursday, said the man, who asked to be identified as Ahmed A. He was told by the International Organization for Migration this week that his flight had been canceled because of the travel ban. Having already sold his home and car and quit his job, he scrambled to find a place to live with friends in Erbil, Iraq. Ahmed A. said he had heard nothing from the International Organization for Migration as of Thursday. A spokesman for the organization in Iraq did not respond to a request for comment. There also was confusion on Thursday for Qusay Fawzi Ahmed, 38, a former military interpreter who moved to Tampa, Fla. in 2012, after receiving a special immigrant visa. On Saturday, Mr. Ahmed was awaiting a phone call from his fiancée, Marwa Nasr   who was flying to New York from Iraq with a valid visa in her passport. After years of waiting, she said, she received approval to join her fiancé. Mr. Ahmed, who works at Domino’s, said he was delivering a pizza in Tampa when his fiancée called him from Kennedy Airport. She told him she had been detained and ordered to fly back to Cairo, where her flight had originated, and then to her home in Erbil. “My fiancée is a    girl  —   she’s not going to bomb anything,” Mr. Ahmed said in a telephone interview. Ms. Din said on Thursday that she had been unable to find out when, or whether, her visa would allow her to join her fiancé in Tampa. “Is this the freedom and democracy we have heard about in the U. S. A. ?” she asked."
"Even if we stop all greenhouse emissions today – which is not exactly realistic – sea levels will continue to rise. That’s not to say that what we do doesn’t matter. In fact, it matters a great deal. But the sea level rise we see today is the consequence of global warming that started from emissions released decades ago. Large bodies of water like the oceans have a great heat capacity – they warm up slowly and keep that temperature for a long time. This means that changes in sea level lag behind warming of the atmosphere. In a new report by the IPCC, we found that the average (or “mean”) global sea level rise on coastlines around the world is likely to be 20-40cm by 2050. There will be regional differences, but all parts of the world will be affected. While this amount of sea level rise may sound manageable, it’s important to keep in mind that other factors will exacerbate the problem.

      IPCC report paints catastrophic picture of melting ice and rising sea levels – and reality may be even worse


 Today, the worst impacts are mostly felt in places where sea level rise has combined with sinking land, also known as subsidence. Subsidence is a natural process, but the weight of high rise buildings and the emptying of underground water reservoirs tends to speed it up. That’s why sinking coastal megacities like Jakarta in Indonesia may suffer a great deal from just 20-40cm of sea level rise. More frequent cyclones and storm surges are also expected as climate change causes more extreme weather. Sea level rise will likely amplify the impacts of these extreme events. In fact, this has already been happening for a while, with deadly effect. In Fiji, storms and elevated sea levels combined to cause devastating floods that claimed at least 11 lives and left 12,000 people temporarily homeless in January 2009. Looking to the end of the 21st century and beyond, two very different scenarios are possible. If the commitments for cutting carbon emissions in the Paris Agreement are met, catastrophic sea level rise can be kept at bay with a global mean rise of 50cm. But if emissions continue at their current rate, one metre of sea level rise is possible by 2100 and up to four metres by 2300.  There are regions of the world which have been built to withstand this level of change. Groundwater pumping in Tokyo caused the land to sink around 4 meters over the course of the 20th century. The city now relies on vast flood defences. This shows that dealing with several metres of sea level rise could be possible, providing financial resources are available to armour the coastline. In many places worldwide, this isn’t the case. For much of the world’s low lying regions, 4 metres of sea level rise would be unmanageable.   How far the oceans rise will depend a great deal on what we do in the next few decades. Whether emissions can be restrained and sharply reduced will mean the difference between manageable disruption and catastrophic inundation. If we take action now, we’ll save and improve the lives of those 680m people who live in coastal areas just 10 metres above sea level.  The best solution would be to remove carbon emissions now while preparing for the portion of sea level rise we can no longer prevent. The best tools for this could be coastal ecosystems themselves.  Depending on local conditions, coastal wetlands, marshes and mangrove swamps can retain sediments and can grow vertically at rates equal to or greater than the mean rate of sea level rise. These habitats can also accumulate carbon 40 times quicker per hectare than tropical forests, making them invaluable for slowing climate change.

      Rising seas: to keep humans safe, let nature shape the coast


 But the world is losing these ecosystems rapidly. Nearly 50% of the natural extent of global coastal wetlands has been lost since the 19th century. In the tropics, people have cleared mangrove forests to grow crops or build aquaculture ponds. Elsewhere, tourist resorts, roads and harbours have been built on top of these habitats.  Depending on what we decide to do and how fast sea levels rise, 20-90% of existing coastal wetlands could be lost by the end of the century. But if coastal wetlands are allowed to thrive and expand, they could reduce emissions and stabilise coastlines at the same time, preventing erosion and flooding. How much sea level rise the world can expect by 2050 is quite well known. Everything after that depends on further emissions. To plan for the worst, structures built by humans should be adapted to accommodate for potentially significant sea level rise in future. In Northern Germany, so-called “climate dikes” have already been built. They have a wide foundation that means they can be built higher depending on the extent of sea level rise in the next few decades. Designing and building infrastructure with future change in mind demands investment today, but it will save lives and money in the long run. Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter.

A new Pew poll finds that three out of four ""consistent liberals"" would rather live in a community ""where the houses are smaller and closer to each other"" but within walking distance of schools, stores, and restaurants. Conversely, three out of four ""consistent conservatives"" would rather live in a larger home on a large lot even if it means driving to schools, stores, and restaurants.   




  


![Media Name: polarization_wherelive.jpg](/sites/cato.org/files/styles/pubs/public/wp-content/uploads/polarization_wherelive.jpg?itok=_IcdXdlS)



  
_Source: Pew Research Center. Click chart to download Pew's 121-page (3.5-MB) report on polarization in America._



Pew says this shows that ""differences between right and left go beyond politics,"" which Pew claims is one of the seven most important things to know about polarization in America. Yet the left has turned the choice between a traditional suburb and a so-called walkable community into a political issue, so it is no wonder that people's views on this choice are polarized.   
  
Disappointingly, Pew's report on polarization defines everything in terms of liberal vs. conservative. Pew's big news is that the share of Americans who are consistently conservative or consistently liberal has more than doubled since 1994--yet you have to read deep into the report to learn that these groups make up just 21 percent of the country. The report says little about the other 79 percent of Americans, yet you'd think they would be important since they outnumber the consistent ones by almost four to one.   




Pew does say that 39 percent of Americans ""take a roughly equal number of liberal and conservative positions,"" while the information that 22 percent are ""mostly liberal"" and 18 percent are ""mostly conservative"" is buried in an appendix. Most of the the body of the report seems to focus on the ""consistent"" extremists.   
  
It seems likely that most of the mixed group, and many of the ""mostlies,"" are libertarians who are fiscally conservative and socially liberal. Yet the term ""libertarian"" isn't once mentioned in the Pew report. Probably fewer are socially conservative and fiscally liberal, a group so small that it has no agreed-upon name, though some call them ""liberal conservatives.""   
  
Libertarians should have been discussed because issues of personal freedom help explain much of the polarization that the report documents. For conservatives, the decision to live in a drivable vs. a walkable community is a mere lifestyle choice. For liberals, it is matter of life and death, making them eager to impose their preferences on others.   
  
This attitude is the source of the increasing polarization which, Pew believes, began growing in the 1970s. Consistent liberals and consistent conservatives both frighten their opponents for the same reason: they are both quite willing to sacrifice your freedom in order to attain their goals.   
  
Social conservatives believe, for example, that an embryo is human, and they are willing to sacrifice a woman's freedom to terminate her embryo or fetus in order to achieve their idea of a moral society. Of course, the key Supreme Court decision on abortion was made in 1973.   
  
Liberals believe that all life on earth depends on us reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and they are willing to sacrifice other peoples' freedom to drive or live in a big house in order to save the planet. Of course, the whole climate change issue grew out of environmental issues that first hit public awareness in about 1970.   
  
Abortion and climate change aren't specifically mentioned in the ten questions used in the Pew poll, but they include proxies for those issues. The questions are listed in full on page 79 of the report, but briefly they are:   






A libertarian would say that at least seven of these questions are really about freedom. Questions 2, 6, 8, 9, and 10 specifically deal with freedom. Questions 3 and 4 have to do with freedom in the sense that confiscating money from you to give to someone else infringes on your freedom (and besides can give the recipients the wrong incentives). Similarly, libertarians might say question 5 should have asked, ""Is the failure of more blacks to get ahead the result of racism or bad incentives created by the welfare state?""   
  
Libertarians would respond to question 1 by arguing that government is both wasteful and infringes on people's freedom, and even if government were efficient they would object to it because of its tendency to reduce freedom. And another way of asking question 7 would be, ""Is it appropriate to use our military to impose our will on other nations, taking away their freedom?""   
  
Almost all of these issues go back to the 1960s and 1970s, a period that started encouraging sexual freedom, minority rights, environmental protection, and a federal ""war on poverty,"" while questioning foreign policy. Only the immigration and corporate profit issues date to another time.   
  
Since so many issues trace back to the 1960s and 1970s, it is no wonder that America has become more polarized since then. Some argue that polarization has resulted from a perceived decline in income equality, but I think this is less important, partly because many of the liberals who make the most of the inequality issue tend to have higher incomes than many of the conservatives who just want government to leave them alone.   
  
Instead, the real source of polarization is this: do I have the right to curtail your freedom to achieve a goal I believe is important even if you don't share that goal? Those who want to end polarization need to to find ways for people to achieve their goals without reducing other peoples' freedom.

Chairman Davis, Delegate Parrott, and members of the Committee, thank you for the invitation to testify on the question of whether the state minimum wage should be increased from $7.25 an hour to $10.10 by 2016 and then indexed for inflation, as proposed by Governor Martin O’Malley (Maryland Minimum Wage Act of 2014), or whether Delegate Neil Parrott’s “County Choice Minimum Wage Bill” (HBO293) would be preferable. That Bill would allow individual counties to determine their own minimum wages based on differential costs of living and economic conditions, rather than be subject to a “one size fits all” state‐​mandated minimum.



 **The Importance of Economic Freedom**  
Of course, the law that would be most consistent with the “Free State” and economic freedom, which is the key to economic development, would be the “law of liberty”—that is, a rule of law consistent with constitutional principles, freedom of contract, and private property rights. Such a law would be conducive to economic development by expanding the range of choices open to individuals.



Legally enforced minimum wage laws—whether federal, state, or local—interfere with worker and employer freedom. They prevent workers from offering to work at less than the legal minimum if they cannot find a job (because their productivity is lower than the government‐​dictated minimum wage), and they prohibit employers from hiring workers who are willing to take entry‐​level jobs at less than the legal minimum wage. Consequently, trades that would be mutually beneficial and enable low‐​skilled workers to get job experience and move up the income ladder are outlawed by minimum wage laws intended to “do good.”



 **Minimum Wage Fallacies and Consequences**  
Governor O’Malley, in supporting a raise in the minimum wage, argues that “the more workers are able to earn, the more customers businesses have,” and “that’s what drives the economy.” The fallacy here is that he is putting the cart before the horse: employers don’t say, “I’ll first pay workers with low skills more and they will then produce more.” Rather, they say, “If a worker acquires more education and skills, or if the demand for my product goes up, then I will be willing to increase that worker’s wage rate and retain her. In truth, the only way to increase the number of jobs _and_ increase wage rates is to _first_ increase the productivity of labor.



Two laws in economics—the law of demand and Say’s law (that supply creates its own demand)—are ignored or downplayed in discussions of the minimum wage. No one has ever disproved the law of demand, which, in the case of the labor market for unskilled workers, says that when the price of labor (the hourly wage rate) increases, other things constant, there will be a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded (i.e., fewer jobs or fewer hours worked). That effect will be greater in the long run than in the short run, as employers shift to labor‐​saving technology and substitute higher‐​skilled workers for lower‐​skilled workers. Moreover, as more low‐​skilled workers search for employment as the minimum wage is increased, not all of them will be successful in finding a job if the minimum wage is greater than the value of the extra output they can produce. Those who can’t find a job will have a zero income, even if the government promises them $10.10 an hour.



Hence, in addition to decreasing employment for unskilled workers, a rise in the minimum wage (in excess of the prevailing market wage) would increase unemployment among young, inexperienced workers (especially minorities)—and this effect would be more pronounced in the long run. Workers who retain their jobs at the higher minimum wage rate are better off, but only at the expense of those who have lost their jobs or can’t find a job. Also employers are likely to increase the remaining workers’ workload and reduce their benefits. These negative impacts of the minimum wage have been well documented (see, e.g., J. A. Dorn, “The Minimum Wage Delusion, and the Death of Common Sense,” _Forbes​.com_ , May 7, 2013).



Say’s Law tells us that workers must first produce more if they are to be paid more and keep their jobs. The minimum wage is neither necessary nor sufficient for real economic growth. Earning a higher wage rate requires sacrifice and hard work, including getting a better education (either through formal schooling or on‐​the‐​job‐​training), and acquiring good work habits. For those workers who are priced out of the market by the minimum wage, their _income_ (wage rate x hours worked) will be zero. The minimum wage helps some workers at the expense of others.



The idea that an increase in the minimum wage automatically makes all workers better off and that overall consumption (aggregate demand) will drive the economy is upside‐​down economics. Workers who can’t find a job at the higher minimum wage or those who lose their jobs will have less to spend, as will employers who have to pay the higher minimum. Even if firms can increase their prices to cover the higher minimum wage, consumers will have less to spend on other things, assuming the Federal Reserve does not accommodate the higher minimum wage by printing money. If more money was printed and inflation occurred, then real wages would go down. There is no free lunch.



The minimum wage redistributes a given economic pie, it doesn’t enlarge it. The only way to “drive the economy” is to raise productivity, not the minimum wage. Today, in anticipation of a higher minimum wage, employers are using tablets and other technology to replace entry‐​level workers. Indeed, if the federal minimum goes to $10.10 and is indexed, states will also have to pay at least that rate—and employers will take action now to protect their profits. International competition means that cost‐​cutting, not price increases, will be the chief weapon to remain competitive. Higher‐​skilled workers (including union workers) will benefit from a higher minimum wage, but those at the bottom will suffer.



 **Politicization of Labor Markets**  
The public supports higher minimum wages because they haven’t thought about the longer‐​run consequences of a minimum wage, and most polls simply ask, “Are you in favor of a higher minimum wage?” without saying anything about the loss of jobs and the unemployment that will occur. When those costs are taken into account, the poll results flip, with a majority saying they do not favor a higher minimum wage (see Emily Ekins, “Americans Will Only Support Obama’s Minimum Wage Increase If It Doesn’t Harm Jobs,” _Rea​son​.com_ , January 28, 2014).



The promise of politicians to increase wages for low‐​skilled workers politicizes labor markets and deludes workers into believing they can keep their jobs _and_ get a higher wage—without any effort on their part. Indeed, workers think of the minimum wage as a “right” even though there is no corresponding responsibility.



An increase from $7.25 to $10.10 an hour is a 40 percent rise in the minimum wage. Coming out of a severe recession and still hindered by slow growth, the U.S. economy needs to be driven by private entrepreneurship, innovation, and education; not by government dictates for higher minimum wages under the illusion they can increase incomes and consumption without any serious negative effects.



Nina Smith, a spokesperson for Governor O’Malley, contends that raising the state minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would “restore much of the value of the minimum wage without imposing a hardship on Maryland businesses.” Indeed, she notes that “increasing the minimum wage rewards work, provides opportunities for businesses to expand their customer base and strengthens our state’s economy.” If so, why not increase the minimum wage to $20 an hour? Also, what is important is not the real minimum wage (i.e., the purchasing power of the nominal minimum wage) but the difference between the nominal minimum wage and the prevailing market wage for unskilled labor. The larger the spread between them, the greater the negative effects of the minimum wage on jobs and unemployment for unskilled workers.



 **Unintended Consequences: Some Empirical Results**  
Tracing the impact of a rise in the minimum wage on employment is difficult because of “confounding factors”—that is, things that are assumed constant in the law of demand. In a recent study that controls for other factors and focuses on the relation between a higher price of labor and the number of jobs in the market for low‐​skilled workers, Joseph Sabia, Richard Burkhauser, and Benjamin Hansen found that when New York State increased the minimum wage by 31 percent—from $5.15 an hour to $6.75, in 2004–06—the number of jobs open to younger, less‐​educated workers _decreased_ by more than 20 percent (“Are the Effects of Minimum Wage Increases Always Small? New Evidence from a Case Study of New York State,” _Industrial and Labor Relations Review_ , April 2012). A 40 percent increase in Maryland’s minimum wage would no doubt have a similar impact, and that impact would be compounded by an increase in the minimum for tipped workers from 50 to 70 percent of the state’s base rate.



In a separate article, Sabia and Burkhauser found “no evidence that minimum wage increases between 2003 and 2007 lowered state poverty rates” (“Minimum Wages and Poverty,” _Southern Economic Journal_ , January 2010). Most Americans earning the minimum wage do not live in poor households. Those most apt to lose their jobs are from low‐​income households; hence, an increase in the minimum wage can actually increase poverty. As David Neumark, Mark Schweitzer, and William Wascher note: “The net effect of higher minimum wages is … to increase the proportion of families that are poor and near‐​poor” (“The Effects of Minimum Wages on the Distribution of Family Incomes,” _Journal of Human Resources_ , 2005).



A more recent study by Jonathan Meer and Jeremy West, economists at Texas A&M University, found that “the most prominent employment effect of minimum wage laws is a decline in the hiring of new employees” with less education and experience (“Effects of the Minimum Wage on Employment Dynamics,” NBER, August 2013). That effect is stronger in the long run, as employers introduce new technology and utilize their skilled workforce more efficiently.



The most rigorous recent study on the employment effects of the minimum wage is an NBER study by Neumark, Salas, and Wascher, “ Revisiting the Minimum Wage‐​Employment Debate: Throwing Out the Baby with the Bathwater?” (January 2013). The authors carefully examine new minimum wage studies that purport to show no negative effects on employment of low‐​skilled workers from a rise in the minimum wage. They find “serious problems” with those studies and conclude: “Evidence still shows that minimum wages pose a tradeoff of higher wages for some against job losses for others, and that policymakers need to bear this tradeoff in mind when making decisions about increasing the minimum wage.”



 **The Case for Choice**  
A more fundamental question is whether legislators should intervene in free labor markets to mandate a minimum wage above the market wage determined by demand and supply. Doing so deprives workers and employers of the freedom of contract that lies at the heart of a dynamic market economy. The wealth of a nation is not enhanced by prohibitions on free trade—whether in product, labor, or capital markets. The role of government in a free society is to prevent barriers to entry, not to create them. People should be free to choose and to improve. The work ethic and character development are the keys to success. But if low‐​skilled workers can’t find a job at the minimum wage, they will never have the opportunity to fully develop themselves and move up the income ladder.



Choice could be improved by adopting the “County Choice Minimum Wage Bill,” which would allow employers to pay a minimum wage determined by the counties they hire in rather than be subject to a single state‐​determined minimum wage. Of course, all counties will have to pay at least the federal minimum wage—so the negative effects on jobs will remain. However, suppose the Congress does not enact President Obama’s proposed hike in the federal minimum to $10.10 over the next three years. Under the County Choice Bill, Maryland counties could opt to remain at the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. If productivity increases, entry‐​level wages would climb _without any government intervention_ , and the nominal minimum wage would fall below the market wage. For all practical purposes, the minimum wage would be a dead letter.



Those counties that did increase their minimum wages would still suffer the adverse consequences. Workers who became unemployed would have an incentive to search for jobs in countries that froze the minimum at $7.25. Those areas would grow and prosper over the longer‐​run, and workers would end up being better off than if there were a single state‐​wide minimum wage. This outcome is similar to what has happened with non‐​union employment and wages—both rose—during the last several decades as workers moved to right‐​to‐​work states.



 **Conclusion**  
Maryland needs more economic freedom, not less. Hong Kong is the freest economy in the world and one of the most prosperous. During most of its long growth period it had no minimum wage. Maryland has the potential to become a dynamic growth state, but to do so it needs to cultivate a business‐​friendly climate with lower tax rates, a better K–12 education system, a reduction in crime, and a political environment that considers the long‐​run impact of economic legislation, not just the short‐​term benefits to special interests.



The Governor’s minimum wage proposal is the wrong medicine for an ailing economy. The County Choice Bill is preferable but would still not escape a higher federal minimum wage. However, if Congress does not increase the minimum wage, then adopting the County Choice Bill would give the free market a chance.

For example Charles Battig at the American Thinker here cited NoTricksZone in his report on Thomas Friedman’s editorial on the supposed “success” of Germany’s renewable energies. In his editorial, Friedman stupidly ignores all the glaring reports and data of Germany’s reneable energy failure, and tries to sell the entire mess as a grand success. In Battig’s words, “He knows how to put the proverbial ‘lipstick on a pig’.” And adds:
A recent German government report notes that Germany’s system ‘rewards the most inefficient plants, doesn’t contribute to protecting the climate, jeopardizes the energy supply and puts the poor at a disadvantage.’  A Nobel Peace Prize for this, Mr. Friedman?
Germany is building new coal power plants to replace the energy provided by nuclear power plants being shut down.  They are to be powered by lignite, a brown coal of low caloric content.  German’s newest and most energy-efficient gas turbine plants are forced into an uneconomical standby status as Energiewende  policies mandate the preferential use of wind and solar.  Thus, cheap lignite-powered plants are built and produce high levels of pollutants that are the exact opposite goals of the government’s green policies.
As for Friedman’s ‘stability of our planet and climate’ concern, he might console himself with the fact that the global satellite temperature record of the past 18 years and 5 months shows a statistically flat line, even as atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen about 10 percent.
Three oinks to Friedman’s lipstick report. It is a green porker.”

Meanwhile, H. Sterling Burnett at the Heartland Institute here has a story on all the temperature data fibbing going on at NASA lately. Though he does not link to NTZ directly, the source of the information behind the tampering shenanigans going on in Switzerland is NTZ here, a story that was shared or liked more than 2000 times.
Burnett writes:
Science journalist Markus Schär of the Swiss news weekly Weltwoche discovered the Swiss Meteorological Service (SMS) tampered with its datasets as well.
For example, in Sion and Zurich, SMS adjustments resulted in a doubling of the temperature trend. Schär notes there has been an 18-year-pause in rising temperatures, even with data- tampering. As a result, Schär calls the adjustments a ‘propaganda trick, and not a valid trend.’
In light of significant urbanization resulting in an expanded heat island effect near many temperature gauges, Schär argues the adjustment of raw data to report higher temperatures than are actually measured is unjustifiable. ‘The corrections … appear so massive that they represent half of the entire temperature increase,’ said Schär.
Even with fudged data, governments have been unable to hide the fact winters in Switzerland and in Central Europe have become colder over the past 20 years, defying predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and other climate alarmists.”

"Look! Up on the screen! It’s a mystery! It’s a sitcom! Oh, and it’s a superhero show! As the   titans Marvel and DC, having already colonized movie theaters, take over ever larger chunks of television and streaming video, they’ve wisely started to mix things up. A new series set in one of their superhero universes just might be capeless, or bring in costumed crime fighters as window dressing. Marvel’s “Jessica Jones” on Netflix largely takes the form of a noirish mystery, while its “Legion” on FX (beginning next week) looks like a surrealist psychological thriller. “Powers” on the PlayStation Network is essentially “Law  Order: Superhumans. ” Perhaps the least superheroish superhero show, though, is NBC’s new “Powerless” (beginning Thursday). It’s a comedy, for one thing, part of a small tradition that includes “The Tick” and the campy,   1960s “Batman. ” (A promo for the show is narrated by that   Batman, Adam West.) And it’s set in a particularly nonheroic corner of the DC universe: the drab offices of Wayne Security, where a cousin of Batman oversees a motley crew designing products that keep civilians from becoming collateral damage in superhero battles. It’s a nifty, layered premise. For one thing, it’s a dig at the big, soulless tentpole movies in which teams of heroes lay waste to cities full of screaming little humans, particularly the “Avengers” films from DC’s rival, Marvel. Seen from another angle  —   as a traditional workplace sitcom  —   the       angle works just as well. What office doesn’t make people feel powerless? It’s hard to judge how that premise will be developed, though, because NBC made only one episode available for review. (The pilot was originally commissioned in 2015, and since then the show’s creator, Ben Queen, has left.) It’s quirky and pleasant but not terribly funny, and the comic situations are standard office sitcom: The new supervisor is hazed the disgruntled workers sort out into nice, mean and wacky stereotypes the boss spends all his time trying to get his cousin Bruce on the phone. Vanessa Hudgens (“Spring Breakers”) stars as the company’s relentlessly perky new head of RD, but if the show succeeds it will be because of an ensemble that includes distinctive performers like Alan Tudyk as the feckless Van Wayne and Danny Pudi, Ron Funches and Christina Kirk as the cranky workers waiting to be whipped into shape. In the pilot, costumed heroes appear only in the amusing credits sequence and in an opening on an elevated train that plays like an  ’    scene from a Hollywood musical. Add a few songs, and it could be from “Meet Me in St. Louis,” except for the supervillain tearing up the train tracks and the superhero  —   an actual DC character, Crimson Fox  —   who saves the day. It’s clever and invigorating, and about the only thing in the pilot that actually makes the connection between office workers and superheroes. “Powerless” is a cute idea for a show, but it will need a lot more scenes like that to turn into a worthwhile series."

The local media has been abuzz this week with the latest buzzword – or should I say buzz phrase – as Chloe Swarbrick showed how hip and woke she is by using the phrase “OK Boomer”. Most of those writing about it in the media are abuzz with glee that a young person with so little actual life experience should take on the older generation… and win!



Well, whether she ‘won’ or not is a matter of opinion, but in the minds of the woke journalists, she buried all boomers in one fell swoop. Well done, Chloe. It was a victory for wokeness and for young people everywhere.



It was also a victory for extremely bad manners.



Firstly, most of us ‘boomers’ (yes, I am one) have children who fall into the Generation X, Generation Y and Generation Z categories, so it is unlikely that we actively dislike our own offspring. I certainly don’t. What we probably don’t particularly like about them is that they rarely listen to advice, and have a very different attitude to life than their parents. But hey, Boomers – how many of us actually listened to advice when we were young? We were the original protestors, remember – the ones who formed the Ban the Bomb movement, the anti-Vietnam War movement and the civil rights movements in the US. Yes, Chloe, the original activists were boomers. All you are doing now is trying to copy our inimitable style.



Does she dislike the fact that boomers do not take climate change sufficiently seriously? Well, some boomers certainly do, but then again, how many times was the world going to end in our lifetimes, only for us to find that after all that, we are still here? It is hard to believe that climate change will destroy the planet when we lived through the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Cold War, the Six Day War, endless Middle East skirmishes – including Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait, Y2K, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center, the end of the world according to the Mayan calendar… and so on. All of these things were going to send us off the planet in a screaming heap. None of them did.



I remember a time when I was at school, when the world was supposedly going to end at 3.00 on a Thursday afternoon right in the middle of a double Science lesson. Everyone believed it. At the time, the world ending was probably preferable to a double Science lesson. But the world didn’t end, the teacher prevailed and the lesson was probably not as bad as the end of the world… it just seemed like it.



We grew up being taught to respect our elders, and even if the world does not see that as a viable way to live any more, the very least we should be doing is respecting one another. But Chloe and her woke friends know better than that. With a single, disrespectful phrase, she thinks she has consigned all of those people on the planet over the age of 55 to the scrapheap of irrelevance. She hasn’t, of course. She has just demonstrated her own ignorance and naivety. 



I guess these young people are no different from the way we were a long time ago. We dissed our parents as old fashioned and out-of-date as well. Even though they had lived through the Depression and the Second World War, we all thought we knew better, didn’t we? Of course we did. And so does Chloe.



What is different is that, because we were brought up to respect all others, and particularly the older generation, we would never have made a statement like Chloe did. We may have muttered under our breath, or to our friends about how old fashioned our parents generation is, but no one would ever go public with it. And no one would ever make such a representation in parliament. It would be considered… gadzooks… _disrespectful!_



And the thought of a 16 year old autistic child telling the world how to behave would have been laughed into oblivion in the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s. How a 16 year old with almost no life experience and with serious mental issues could possibly be considered as some kind of Messiah is totally laughable. Sorry, Chloe. You may think she is a hero. (Sorry, should that be a non gender specific person of heroic tendencies?) In reality, whether you like it or not, she is a [damaged young woman](https://thebfd.co.nz/2019/04/climate-change-activist-greta-thunberg-exploited-and-manipulated/), who needs help, not heroism. If anyone is likely to end in a screaming heap, it is Saint Greta.



But we boomers already know that… and we feel sorry for Greta, obnoxious though she is, because she is a damaged child. We understand that.



Just one final thought, Chloe. It is awesome being woke. We were all the equivalent of ‘woke’ in our day, with Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Cream, The Beatles and the Rolling Stones (to name but a few) all screaming it out for our generation. Actually, I forgot to mention The Who, who really did scream it out for My Generation. Yes, Chloe, it has all been done before. You are nothing new.



But here is the scary stuff, Chloe. Baby boomers vote. We were taught to do so by our parents who either witnessed, or understood the importance of suffrage, particularly for women. They told never to miss the opportunity to vote. And we have always heeded that advice, Chloe. Because, our parents were right.



You just might want to think about that, Baby.

President Trump will attend the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.



On the face of it, the annual jolly for worldwide business and political elites at a ski resort in Switzerland looks an unwelcoming environment for the President. “Davos Man” is seen by many as the manifestation of the globalist agenda Trump denounces. The biggest acclaim at last year’s jaunt, after all, went to President Xi of China, as he outlined a robust defense of free trade days after Trump’s inauguration extolled protectionism.



But there’s an argument to be made that on other issues, Trump’s likely opinions will provide the shake‐​up the Forum needs.



Rich people blowing company cash in an expensive resort to bloviate their political views and contemplate the musings of “very important people” is in itself not particularly interesting. But when politicians, businessmen, lobbyists, commentators and regulators get together committing to “improving the state of the world,” there are reasons to be concerned.



The first is that by design elites and vested interests dominate the conversation.



As an example, last year the forum contained business voices denouncing Brexit, with major banks and other established international companies lamenting potential impacts on supply chains and their commercial activities. Totally unrepresented were British consumers, who pay higher prices for external goods because of EU‐​level tariffs, and small businesses and yet‐​to‐​exist enterprises, which disproportionately bear the costs, or don’t exist, due to EU regulations.



Indeed, it should not surprise us given the aligned interests of participants that Davos Man is so prone to groupthink on the issues of the day. A look back at the conference of 2006 shows little to no discussion of global systemic financial risks, but concern about bird flu being the next Black Death.



And who can blame them? Financiers, industrialists and regulators at Davos on any given year are generally success stories under current policies, and see near‐​term concerns as threats to their position, and arguably ignore larger systemic problems on the horizon.



Elites, by definition, have done well out of the status quo. They have wealth and power that they seek to preserve. It should not surprise us then to see the World Economic Forum now pushes articles about how to “deal” with supposed populism. Conventional elite wisdom worldwide is social democratic — that political fissures have arisen because of economic anxieties and inequalities.



So the lazy “solution” is for more government investment or more redistribution to keep the populists at bay. It just so happens bigger government will inevitably mean politicians dealing with and buying goods and services from existing major businesses — the very sort that appear at the World Economic Forum every January.



Perhaps the biggest problem with Davos Man though is the general hubris that the global elite can sit around and develop technocratic solutions to solve problems. The essential insight of Nobel Prize‐​winning economist Friedrich Hayek was that information was inherently decentralized. Localities, regions and countries are shaped by their own institutions, histories and cultures.



Dispersed decisions made by billions of individuals provide companies with information about how to allocate resources. The idea that progress comes from elites devising global plans for “responsive leadership,” “a collective purpose,” and by shaping “the future by … unparalleled global effort in co‐​design, co‐​creation and collaboration” is at best delusional and at worst leads to bad ideas gaining traction.



Davos Man is on the whole cosmopolitan and sees himself as a “citizen of the world.” And in areas such as free trade and open migration, international businesspeople have been worthy supporters of economic liberty, which enables individuals to realize their wants and needs through voluntary cooperation.



But that same worldview that sees elite global action as key to prosperity also tends to be attracted to questionable grand projects, from burgeoning foreign aid spending, to constructionist international political projects such as the EU and eurozone and extensive global interventionism to “deal with” climate change and conflict. The knee‐​jerk Davos Man view is that all global cooperation and action is a good thing.



This makes Trump’s visit all the more interesting. His ideas on trade and migration fly in the face of evidence. But his views and approach to other issues from aid to the UN may just be the grit in the oyster necessary for some introspection on behalf of the global elites.



As the economist Bill Easterly once said, Davos Man may not be ready to acknowledge that he does not hold the fate of humanity in his gilded hands. But that need not stop the rest of us.”

"Last summer, former President Bill Clinton pledged that if Hillary Clinton won the presidential election, he would avoid conflicts by stepping aside from many of his duties at the Clinton Foundation, restricting foreign donations to the charity and spinning off certain programs. Now, nearly three months after Mrs. Clinton’s defeat, the foundation is still grappling with its place in the era of President Trump. It faces some daunting challenges: a drop in   during the campaign uncertainty about the scale of the former president’s ambitions and questions about leadership, including how long its president, Donna E. Shalala, will stay, and whether Mrs. Clinton might rejoin the charity. Mr. Clinton, in a letter to be released with the foundation’s annual report this week, went so far as to ask supporters for advice on its future. “We seek both your input and your ideas,” he wrote, noting that the organization would work to expand its impact. Ms. Shalala, in an interview on Thursday, acknowledged the difficulties. “Last year was a tough year,” she said, “because people were beating on us with nonsense,” a reference to bruising political attacks claiming that donors were using the foundation to curry favor with the Clintons. Revenues were down for 2016, Ms. Shalala acknowledged, in part because of voluntary restrictions and the fact that the charity’s major    —   the former president and his daughter, Chelsea  —   were campaigning for Mrs. Clinton. Revenues “dropped during the economic downturn, too,” Ms. Shalala said. Still, both Mr. Clinton and Ms. Shalala, who also cited concerns in keeping talent, expressed optimism. “At the end of the day,” she said, “I think this is going to be as it always was: a creative, dynamic foundation that helps to improve the lives of millions. ” As the foundation looks within, many experts said it was right to assess its future, including whether a great enough need still existed for its most prominent asset: the ability to bring the private sector together with charities to help underserved causes. “It’s certainly a different landscape than it was” when the foundation’s work began, said Carolyn Miles, president and chief executive of Save the Children, one of the foundation’s early partners. “I would say you have to come back as something slightly different. ” In recent weeks, the foundation has completed a planned shutdown of the Clinton Global Initiative, which hosted a   annual meeting, and laying off most of the initiative’s staff of about 100. Foundation officials confirmed on Thursday that two major programs, including one in Haiti, would transfer out of the foundation. The organization has also considered scaling back other efforts, according to several people familiar with the discussions, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Staff members have prepared options for Bill and Chelsea Clinton to consider, which include some new endeavors, Ms. Shalala said. Meanwhile, foundation officials are striving to project an image of business as usual. The new annual report highlighted the organization’s efforts across the world, including opening a health clinic in Malawi and expanding its role in countering the opioid crisis in the United States. During the holidays, Mr. Clinton reached out to donors offering to match   contributions. Chelsea Clinton and foundation staff members in January packed grapefruits at a community service event in New York with City Harvest. And Ms. Shalala announced a new partnership to enhance the health of children in San Diego County. President Trump’s executive order banning federal assistance for international health groups if they counsel women on or provide abortions has also contributed to fears of a broader decline in funding for global health work. Ms. Shalala said she had discussed how to contend with that possibility in a recent conversation with Bill Gates, whose charity has supported the Clinton Foundation and many other nonprofits. The foundation was formed in 1997 during Mr. Clinton’s presidency and has raised roughly $2 billion since then. Its work has spanned 3, 500 projects and 180 countries including the United States, with projects as varied as earthquake recovery in Haiti and health initiatives in Rwanda. During the presidential campaign, political opponents pounded the foundation, criticizing its dealings with foreign donors and financiers. No evidence emerged of a quid pro quo while Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, but the overlapping interests of foreign donors to the foundation and official international affairs dogged her candidacy. The philanthropy was a focus for Mrs. Clinton after her time as secretary of state and before her recent presidential run. In terms of deciding whether to   “we are not there yet even remotely now,” Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said. Ms. Shalala, who served as secretary of health and human services under Mr. Clinton and seemed destined for a White House role if Mrs. Clinton had prevailed, said it was unclear how long she would stay as the foundation’s president. For the moment, hiring appears muted: Most of the job postings on the foundation’s website are for food service and catering jobs at the Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Ark. Many believe the foundation’s future will depend on Mr. Clinton, now 70, always its driving force. “Does he still have the energy, passion, desire and the good health in order to devote energy to it?” Neal   the chief executive of the global humanitarian organization Mercy Corps, asked during a phone interview from Davos, Switzerland, during the World Economic Forum in January. On Thursday, Ms. Shalala described the former president and Chelsea Clinton, who both serve on the foundation’s board, as engaged, “main influences” on   with Mr. Clinton still a draw for donors. “He’s got a lot of friends,” Ms. Shalala said. But others saw obstacles ahead. “The big issue they are going to face is to what degree can they raise money now that the Clintons seem to be out of national leadership positions,” said Leslie Lenkowsky, a philanthropy expert at Indiana University. “They have lost a little bit of their luster. ” In 2015, the charity’s revenues were nearly $300 million, down from $338 million in 2014, according to its annual report. It has not yet released figures for 2016, but Ms. Shalala acknowledged that they were lower. Internal goals of raising $20 million in unrestricted funds in 2016 were surpassed, but “took a lot of effort to get there,” she said. In August, at the official start of the general election campaign, the foundation announced its decision to shutter the Clinton Global Initiative, a yearly gathering that Douglas J. Band, a longtime aide of Mr. Clinton’s, had conceived of as a way to connect wealthy donors and corporations with worthy causes. It held its final meeting in September. By contrast, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, known as CHAI  —   a separate but affiliated entity  —   halted a series of moves designed to disengage from the Clintons in the event that Mrs. Clinton won the White House. Regan Lachapelle, a spokeswoman for CHAI, said the group’s work was continuing amid discussions about its future. “None of it’s resolved,” said Dr. Paul Farmer, a board member of CHAI, which has health programs in 70 countries that include promoting AIDS treatment and strengthening health systems, in a telephone interview from Haiti. “Knowing what to do in this climate is a tough call. ” Across the worldwide outposts where the Clinton Foundation has a presence, speculation about its future has been rampant. In some foreign countries, CHAI has been accused of using the Clintons’ influence to pressure governments into pursuing certain initiatives, or rewarding favored American development partners. “If they disappear it would be very ironic,” said Dr. Patricia A. McQuilkin, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Speaking from Liberia, she said CHAI’s initiatives in the wake of the Ebola epidemic had sidelined longtime academic partnerships like hers. “They insinuate themselves into the whole process and try to take it over,” she said. Development experts, including Daniel F. Runde, a former director of the Office of Global Development Alliances at the United States Agency for International Development, generally expressed the belief that the foundation could continue to attract support for its work. “It’s a damaged brand,” Mr. Runde said, “but there remains an international demand for them. ” For years, the Clinton Foundation has worked with organizations founded by other former presidents, from Lyndon B. Johnson to George W. Bush. In recent months, Ms. Shalala said, foundation officials have offered advice for former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, on their own foundation, which will focus on national and international community building programs. “They called and asked some questions,” Ms. Shalala said."
"**The UK needs tougher rules to curb the dominance of Google and Facebook, including powers to break them up, the Competition and Markets Authority has said.**
It is concerned that the firms' dominance in digital advertising raises barriers for new competitors.
This may be pushing up prices for consumers, the CMA said.
The tech giants said they faced strong competition and that they would work with regulators on their concerns.
The CMA, which has been investigating their power in advertising for a year, said on Wednesday that it was ""concerned that they have developed such unassailable market positions that rivals can no longer compete on equal terms"".
Google has more than 90% of the Â£7.3bn search advertising market in the UK, it said.
Facebook takes more than half of the Â£5.5bn UK online display advertising market.
The CMA said the services provided by Google and Facebook ""are highly valued by consumers and help many small businesses to reach new customers"".
But it said their massive reach is a source of power and that ""each has unmatchable access to user data"".
""If the Â£14bn spend in the UK last year on digital advertising is higher than it would be in a more competitive market, this will be felt in the prices for hotels, flights, consumer electronics, books, insurance and many other products that make heavy use of digital advertising,"" the CMA said.
It said that Google and Facebook's market positions ""also have a profound impact on newspapers and other publishers"", with newspapers reliant on the giants for nearly 40% of visits to their sites.
The CMA called for a new ""Digital Markets Unit"" to enforce a new code of conduct for big tech firms and allow more data accessibility for rivals.
It would also have the power to break up the tech firms if necessary, such as being able to order Google Ad Manager, its advertising management platform, to become a separate business,.
The CMA said it would work with watchdogs the Information Commissioner's Office and Ofcom to establish a ""Digital Markets Taskforce"" to advise the government on a new regulatory regime.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said it would ""carefully consider"" the CMA recommendations.
Ronan Harris, Google UK and Ireland vice-president, said digital advertising ""helps businesses find customers and supports the websites that people know and love"".
Mr Harris added that Google would ""continue to work constructively with regulatory authorities and government"".
A Facebook spokesman said: ""Providing a free service, funded by advertising that is relevant and useful, gives millions of people and businesses in the UK the opportunity to connect and share.
""We face significant competition from the likes of Google, Apple, Snap, Twitter and Amazon, as well as new entrants like TikTok, which keeps us on our toes.""
He said Facebook would be ""engaging with UK government bodies on rules that protect consumers and help small businesses rebuild as the British economy recovers"".
The CMA is ""passing the baton to the UK government with a range of politically controversial proposals"", according to Christian Ahlborn, global head of competition at law firm Linklaters.
""One is left wondering whether the fact that many of its ideas would have caused political ructions on the other side of the Atlantic has played a significant role"" in its deciding not to launch a market investigation and instead recommend legislation, he said.
The UK and other European countries have been at loggerheads with the US over international proposals for tech giants ""to pay their fair share of tax""."
"Many numbers are bandied around in climate emergency discussions. Of them, 1.5°C is perhaps the most important. At the Paris Agreement in 2015, governments agreed to limit global warming to well below 2°C and to aim for 1.5°C. By 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the UN body tasked with relaying the science of climate breakdown to the world – had made worryingly clear in a special report how much graver the consequences of the higher number would be. Together with the University of Queensland’s Ove Hoegh-Guldberg and colleagues around the world, we’ve explored in newly published work just how much sticking to 1.5°C matters. Climate breakdown is already harming livelihoods, cities and ecosystems. From heatwaves and droughts to cyclones and floods, devastating extreme weather events  are more frequent, more intense and more unpredictable than they would be in the absence of global heating. Warming and acidifying oceans are causing severe coral bleaching to occur twice as often as in 1980, leaving many unable to recover. Shrinking habitats are increasingly forcing wildlife into conflict with human settlements. Increasing wildfires are damaging vital carbon stores in North America and Siberia, while the advance of spring is throwing species who depend on each other out of sync.   The more we destabilise our climate, the greater the risk to human societies and ecosystems. Even at 1.5°C of global heating, tough times are in store for the living planet. But the space between 1.5°C and 2°C of heating is a crucial battleground, within which risks to humanity and ecosystems amplify rapidly. At 1.5°C of warming, about one in twenty insect and vertebrate species will disappear from half of the area they currently inhabit, as will around one in ten plants. At 2°C, this proportion doubles for plants and vertebrates. For insects, it triples. Such high levels of species loss will put many ecosystems across the world at risk of collapse. We rely on healthy ecosystems to pollinate crops, maintain fertile soil, prevent floods, purify water, and much more. Conserving them is essential for human survival and prosperity. Between 1.5°C and 2°C, the number of extremely hot days increases exponentially. Some parts of the world can also expect less rain and more consecutive dry days, while others will receive more extreme floods. Collectively, this will place agriculture, water levels and human health under severe stress – especially in southern African nations, where temperatures will increase faster than the global average. The Mediterranean is another key area at particular risk above 1.5°C of heating, where increased drought will alter flora and fauna in a way without precedent in ten millennia. At 1.5°C of warming, we could expect to lose between 70% and 90% of our coral reefs. While this would be catastrophic for the millions of ocean creatures and human livelihoods these beautiful ecosystems support, there would still be a chance of recovery in the long term if oceans warm slowly. But at 2°C of warming, we could kill 99% of reefs. To be clear, this is a line that once crossed cannot be easily uncrossed. It could mean the extinction of thousands of species.

      What climate 'tipping points' are – and how they could suddenly change our planet


 Arctic sea ice has been a constant on our planet for hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of years. If we limit global heating to 1.5°C, there’s a 70% chance of it remaining that way. But at 2°C, some Arctic summers will be ice-free. Polar bears and other species who depend on frozen sea ice to eat and breed will be left homeless and struggling to survive. Studies show that at 1.5°C, we could expect one metre of sea-level rise in 2300, with an extra 26cm at 2°C. However, between these two levels of global heating, the risk of the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets starting a slow process of decline dramatically increases. For the Greenland sheet, this is likeliest to happen at 1.6°C, with the Antarctic ice sheet’s tipping point hovering not far above this mark. If these ice sheets melt, seas could rise by up to two metres over the next two centuries. These rises could lead to millions more people being exposed to flooding each year. Many of those living in coastal cities, deltas, or small islands will be faced with little option but to build upwards or relocate. The impacts of climate breakdown are accelerating. The planet has warmed by 1.1°C since 1850-79, but 0.2°C of this warming happened between 2011 and 2015 alone. The last four years were the warmest in the global temperature record. Despite knowing all the above, many country-level commitments and action are nowhere near enough to limit warming to 2°C, let alone 1.5°C. We’re heading for 2.9°C to 3.4°C of warming. By this point, many dangerous tipping points could be crossed, leading to rainforest die-back, deadly heatwaves, and significant sea-level rise. Half of all insect and plant species are projected to disappear from more than half of the area they currently inhabit, potentially causing widespread ecosystem collapse and threatening organised human civilisation itself.

      Five things every government needs to do right now to tackle the climate emergency


 Limiting warming to 1.5°C will save the global economy trillions of dollars in the long run, even accounting for the seemingly gargantuan cost of transitioning our energy systems. But this is more than just an economic or academic issue – its a matter of life and death for millions of humans and animal species, and a severe threat to the well-being of billions. Tackling climate breakdown is perhaps the tallest order humanity has ever faced, and there is no simple solution. The only way forward is accepting that we must fundamentally change the way we live our lives. It won’t be an easy transition, but there is no alternative if we are to preserve the well-being of humans, wildlife, and ecosystems.

"In the Arctic, a summer of heat, melting and fire was rounded off by news that 2019 saw the second-lowest ever minimum extent of sea ice. That’s the point in early autumn each year when scientists say that the  Arctic Ocean will begin to freeze again. By that measure, only 2012 had less sea ice than this year. Meanwhile, the IPCC’s latest special report on the oceans and cryosphere was full of bad news (the cryosphere is that part of the earth system where water occurs in its frozen form, usually as snow or ice). The region’s glacier ice is retreating, the ground is thawing, forests are becoming a fire risk. Only people in low lying islands are as vulnerable to climate change as those in the Arctic, according to the IPCC.

      IPCC report paints catastrophic picture of melting ice and rising sea levels – and reality may be even worse


 So what happened in the Arctic in 2019? And why do Arctic geographers like me say what happens there matters so much for the world?  Let’s start by looking at what made this year so worrying: Greenland started melting early in 2019 and this reached historically high levels when warm air from Europe’s midsummer heat wave arrived, causing melting over more than 90% of its surface.  While the cumulative area of melting is still smaller than the record-setting season of 2012, the total amount of ice lost is similar, because 2019’s early melting quickly removed the previous winter’s low snowfall and exposed older, dirty ice to the sun’s glare.  Scientists also measure the end-of-winter maximum extent of ice cover, and this was also historically low, although not record setting. But lots of melting in spring and summer meant by mid-August there was only fractionally more ice than the same time in 2012, the year of record minimum. Moreover, Arctic sea ice is now less than half as thick as it was at this time of year in 1980, meaning it is less resilient to even moderately warm summers.  Probably most remarkable was the extent of vegetation burning right across the Arctic. By late July these slow-burning, long-duration fires had released 100m tonnes of carbon, an amount similar to the annual output of countries like Belgium, Kuwait or Nigeria. By the middle of August, the smoke cloud covered an area larger than the European Union. Meanwhile, an extraordinary 32℃ heatwave fuelled a particularly intense fire season in Alaska, which released roughly three times more carbon than the state emits each year from burning fossil fuels. Air temperatures in the Arctic are increasing at least twice as fast as the global average. This is down to a series of strong “feedbacks” that amplify the initial warming and in turn create more warming. For instance the loss of reflective snow and ice means more solar energy will be absorbed in the ground and ocean, warming the earth, causing more snow and ice to melt, and so on.  These feedbacks make the Arctic particularly sensitive to changes in climate: with 1.5℃ of global warming, one sea-ice-free Arctic summer is projected per century, whereas at 2℃ this increases to at least one per decade. Such effects would be bad enough if confined to the Arctic Circle and above, but what goes on up there really does affects almost every human on the planet. Here are a few reasons why: 1. More persistent and extreme mid-latitude weather The exceptional rate of Arctic warming is shrinking the temperature difference between the far north and the mid-latitudes, and there is mounting evidence that this reduces the intensity of the polar-front jet stream, which crosses the North Atlantic from west to east and determines the paths of weather systems.  A slower and more contorted jet stream allows cold air to move further south and warm air to move further north, and it also allows weather systems to persist longer than usual. Under these circumstances, episodes of severe cold or protracted heat, as the UK experienced in spring and summer 2018 respectively, become more likely.  2. The sea level will rise The Arctic contains the world’s second largest repository of freshwater: the Greenland Ice Sheet. As that water melts into the ocean and raises the sea level, the effects will be felt globally. Under a business-as-usual scenario, Greenland alone could lead to sea level rise this century of at least 14cm and as much as 33cm. By 2200, it could be a metre or more.  Such estimates aren’t very precise, partly because the science is hard, but also because we simply don’t know if we’ll get our emissions under control. Whatever actually happens, it’s clear that many people will be affected: even under conservative growth assumptions, there could be 880m people living in flood-exposed coastal regions by 2030, and more than a billion by 2060. 3. An unplanned withdrawal from the 1.5℃ carbon budget In order to have a 66% probability of avoiding global warming beyond 1.5℃, the IPCC says we can release no more than 113 billion additional tonnes of carbon. That’s only about ten years of emissions at the current rate.  Arctic wildfires will eat into that “carbon budget”, and reduce the room for manoeuvre of governments that have committed to the Paris Agreement. These fires have been particularly carbon-intensive as they are burning through peatlands, which are rich in decomposed organic matter and are a vast source of ancient carbon. Until recently these peatlands were frozen solid. Now, many areas are increasingly vulnerable to ignition from lightning strikes or human activity.  Some scientists have therefore suggested that Arctic fire management should be reconsidered as a critical climate mitigation strategy. Although changes in the Arctic can have global ramifications, it’s important to remember that it remains home to a diverse, partly-indigenous population of several million. Arctic peoples already face numerous challenges including pollution, overfishing, habitat fragmentation, and cultural and economic transformation. The reduction in “reliably frozen” areas adds considerably to these challenges, and its not certain that Arctic people will even share in any benefits from things like a growth in shipping.  Change in the Arctic is largely driven by activity elsewhere. But these changes in turn have an impact far beyond the region, on the atmosphere, sea level rise, or our global carbon budget. This circular process only serves to underline the pervasive character of contemporary climate change.  Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

An increasingly popular theme in the news media and the foreign policy community is that during Donald Trump’s presidency, the United States has abandoned, lost, or perverted its global leadership role—with alarming consequences.



A July 26 article by the _Washington Post_ ’s Dan Balz is merely the latest contribution to that school of thought. Balz asserts that “America’s standing in the world is at a low ebb. Once described as the indispensable nation, the United States is now seen as withdrawn and inward‐​looking, a reluctant and unreliable partner at a dangerous moment for the world.” He adds that “President Trump shattered a 70‐​year consensus among U.S. presidents of both political parties that was grounded in the principle of robust American leadership in the world through alliances and multilateral institutions. For decades, this approach was seen at home and abroad as good for the world and good for the United States.”



The last statement is highly questionable on both counts. There were earlier episodes (the Vietnam and Iraq wars come readily to mind) when there was considerable domestic discontent about whether Washington’s strategy was good for the United States. Populations in nations that have been the targets of U.S. ministrations over the decades, including North Korea, Iran, Guatemala, Vietnam, Lebanon, Serbia, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Yemen, also likely would dispute Balz’s complacent view that U.S. global leadership has been good for them. Washington’s sanctions, coups, foreign aid to corrupt dictators, and military interventions confirm that U.S. foreign policy frequently has been a train wreck causing great human suffering.



There is little question that on an array of issues, countries around the world, including longtime U.S. allies in Europe and East Asia, are showing noticeable reluctance to follow Washington’s lead. That reaction has grown more frequent and intense during the Trump presidency, as I have pointed out with respect to issues such as withdrawing from the multilateral agreement regarding Iran’s nuclear program, achieving greater burden‐​sharing within NATO and other alliances, and taking a more hardline stance regarding China’s aggressive behavior.



The idea that it’s all Trump’s fault or that the U.S. ‘relinquished’ its role as world leader is a delusion.



But the resistance towards Washington’s policy preferences have been growing for many years. Indeed, even during the Cold War, such foot‐​dragging emerged from time‐​to‐​time, despite the existence of a mutual security threat that fostered allied deference to the West’s superpower protector. Moreover, much of the world was either under Soviet domination or clung to neutrality, so Washington’s writ did not apply at all in those cases. The ability of the United States to entice and cajole a majority of nations to support its policy initiatives actually seemed to peak in the years between the Persian Gulf War and the Iraq War. That period, which Charles Krauthammer memorably described as the “unipolar moment,” existed only because of the Soviet Union’s decline and demise, which enabled the United States to exercise an extraordinary degree of global dominance. The key term in Krauthammer’s formulation, though, was “moment.”



Even during the 1990s, the world was continuing to become more multipolar economically, and that process was accelerating. Soon, the signs of greater political and diplomatic independence would follow. When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asserted in 1998 that America was the “indispensable nation,” the unipolar moment was at its zenith, and it would begin to fade. The arrogance and national narcissism of Albright’s stance matched or exceeded anything Donald Trump has voiced. Her statement that “we stand taller and see further than other countries into the future,” did not encourage collegial decision‐​making within the international community or imply U.S. respect for the views and interests of those “other countries.”



The leading NATO allies already were chafing at Washington’s policy dominance, and the push for an independent European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) within the European Union at the end of the 1990s reflected the desire for options outside a U.S.-dominated NATO. The 9–11 attacks short‐​circuited that campaign, and led to a closing of ranks to meet the alarming terrorist threat. But as George W. Bush’s administration broadened the response to 9–11 into a global “war on terror,” and used it as a pretext for forcible regime change in Iraq, allied enthusiasm for the policy waned. Several key NATO states, most notably Germany, declined to participate in the U.S.-led war to oust Saddam Hussein. Resistance to other Bush administration initiatives also emerged. When President Bush strongly pushed to give NATO membership to Ukraine and Georgia, both France and Germany pushed back, firmly refusing to adopt that policy. President Obama found no greater enthusiasm that move, since Paris and Berlin correctly feared that it would needlessly provoke Russia.



The Bush and Obama administrations also encountered resistance from the East Asian allies, especially Japan and South Korea, when Washington sought to broaden the purpose of the bilateral security treaties with those countries into a coordinated, multilateral effort to deal with other contingencies in the Asian theater. Japanese and South Korean leaders especially worried that Obama’s “strategic pivot” to Asia might be the initial stage of an implicit containment policy directed against China, and they were wary of such a mission. They appreciated the security insurance that an alliance with the United States provided, but enlisting in an anti‐​China strategy was too high a premium.



Washington’s ability to get its way internationally has decreased during the Trump years, and the president’s abrasive style has played a role. But the notion that the United States has willingly “relinquished” or “abandoned” global leadership misses the mark. Even where the administration has taken a step back, it is primarily on peripheral matters, such as withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement and the UN Human Rights Council, and cutting ties with the World Health Organization. As fond as world governance advocates might be of such institutions, they are not central (or even terribly relevant) to strategic and geopolitical affairs. On most other matters, Washington’s activism (especially activism regarding security issues) is as great as ever.



The reluctance of other nations to bow to Washington’s policy wishes did not begin when Donald Trump took the oath of office, and the causes are much deeper



than resentment at him or his leadership style. Such policy independence reflects both the emergence of a more multipolar international system and the corollary that even America’s closest allies recognize that their best interests do not always align with those of Washington. Again, the emergence of that recognition predates the Trump presidency, and it accurately reflects not just governmental policy but public opinion, especially in democratic states. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey found that nearly half of the respondents in several major European NATO countries opposed using force even to defend an alliance partner under attack. Yet that obligation is the core of Washington’s long‐​standing European security policy. The widespread reluctance of European publics to abide by that policy was evident nearly 18 months before Trump took office.



It may be a comforting illusion for American advocates of an idealized, pre‐​Trump foreign policy to believe that once he leaves office, matters will return to “normal,” and other nations will obediently follow America’s supposedly enlightened global leadership. But that belief is an illusion. The world has changed in fundamental, structural ways that have little to do with Trump or his policies. In a more multipolar international system—one that has been gradually developing over several decades—countries have both the ability and inclination to pursue their own interests and not blindly defer to Washington’s wishes. That pattern likely will continue and deepen no matter who occupies the White House.

"**Boycotts can be extremely effective - as Facebook is finding out.**
In the late 18th century, the abolitionist movement encouraged British people to stay away from goods produced by slaves. It worked. Around 300,000 stopped buying sugar - increasing the pressure to abolish slavery.
The Stop Hate for Profit campaign is the latest movement to use boycott as a political tool. It claims that Facebook doesn't do enough to remove racist and hateful content from its platform.
It's convinced a series of major companies to pull advertising from Facebook and some other social media companies.
Among the latest to do so are Ford, Adidas and HP. They join earlier participants including Coca-Cola, Unilever and Starbucks.
News site Axios has also reported that Microsoft suspended advertising on Facebook and Instagram in May because of concerns about unspecified ""inappropriate content"" - a development the BBC can confirm.
Meanwhile, other online platforms, including Reddit and Twitch, have piled on more pressure by taking anti-hate steps of their own.
Can that boycott hurt Facebook? The short answer is yes - the vast majority of Facebook's revenue comes from ads.
David Cumming from Aviva Investors told the BBC's Today programme that the loss of trust, and a perceived absence of a moral code, could ""destroy the business"".
On Friday, Facebook's share price dropped by 8% - making chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, theoretically at least, Â£6bn poorer.
But whether this could be bigger - an existential threat to Facebook's long-term future - is far less clear.
First of all, this isn't the first boycott of a social media company.
In 2017, major brand after major brand announced they would stop advertising on YouTube - after ads were placed next to racist and homophobic videos.
That particular boycott is now almost totally forgotten. YouTube tweaked its ad policies, and three years on YouTube's parent company Google is doing just fine.
And there are more reasons to believe this boycott isn't as damaging to Facebook as you might think.
Firstly, many companies have only committed to a one-month boycott in July.
Secondly, and perhaps more significantly, much of Facebook's advertising revenue comes from thousands and thousands of small- to medium-sized businesses.
CNN reports that the highest-spending 100 brands accounted for $4.2bn in Facebook advertising last year \- or about 6% of the platform's ad revenue.
So far, the vast majority of medium-sized companies have not signed up.
Mat Morrison, head of strategy at advertising agency Digital Whiskey, told me there's a huge number of smaller businesses that ""can't afford not to advertise"".
He says that for smaller businesses - which are priced out of advertising on TV - cheaper and more focussed ads on platforms like Facebook are essential.
""The only way our business works is having access to these highly targeted audiences, that aren't mass media audiences, so we'll continue to advertise"" Morrison says.
In some ways Facebook looks like a good choice of company to lobby. The structure of Facebook gives Mark Zuckerberg a huge amount of power to effect change. If he wants something, he'll get it.
You only need to change the mind of one man.
But the reverse is also true. Shareholders aren't able to put pressure on Mr Zuckerberg in the same way as other companies. If he doesn't want to act, he won't.
So far though, he has shown signs he's prepared to move. On Friday, Facebook announced it would begin to tag hateful content - and look out for further announcements this week.
These changes won't be enough to make Stop Hate for Profit go away though.
And elsewhere, others are taking action of their own.
This Monday, Reddit has banned The_Donald forum as part of a wider crackdown on ""subreddits"" whose members have engaged in harassment and threatening behaviour. The community was not officially linked to the President, but had helped widely spread memes that supported him, before Reddit took earlier steps to limit the posts' reach.
In addition, Twitch has temporarily banned an account run by the Trump campaign.
The Amazon-owned video-streaming site said two videos of Mr Trump's rallies that were shown on its platform had broken its rules on hateful conduct.
One dated from 2015, before he was elected, at which he had said Mexico was sending rapists to the US. The other was from earlier this month, in which the President had described a fictional ""tough hombre"" breaking into the home of an American woman.
""We do not make exceptions for political or newsworthy content,"" Twitch said in a statement.
This year is going to be a rocky year for all social media companies.
Facebook is by no means the exception. But companies will always be guided by their balance sheets.
If the boycott drags on into the autumn - and if more and more companies sign up - this could be a defining year for the social network."

Welcome back to Ninth Circuit Review‐​Reviewed, your monthly recap of administrative law before arguably ‘the second most important court in the land.’



In this month’s post, the common thread among the controversies is that they all implicate how courts can render administrative policy by interpreting texts that carry the force of law. In this realm, courts are bound primarily by themselves, which is why I’ve organized the cases below into three categories of decreasing judicial modesty.



Mr. Istvan Szonri, a lawful permanent resident, pled guilty to multiple sex crimes under the California Penal Code. Based on these violations, the Board of Immigration Appeals concluded that Szonyi was removable because his offenses did not arise out of a “single scheme of criminal misconduct,”” as this statutory phrase is currently interpreted by BIA. In 1959, however, the Ninth Circuit had reached a conflicting interpretation of the same statutory provision, which the court reaffirmed most recently in 1991. In _Szonyi v. Whitaker_, Szonyi argued that the court’s interpretation should override the agency’s interpretation.



Notwithstanding that the statutory provision in _Szonyi_ falls squarely within the judiciary’s range of expertise, the Ninth Circuit panel declined to give priority to its own construction. The panel noted that its precedent ‘was decided before _Chevron_ , so we did not… have reason to apply the _Chevron_ framework and did not specifically comment on the ambiguity of the statutory text under _Chevron_ step one.’ Having concluded that the statute was, in fact, ambiguous, the court deferred to the agency. In dismissing its own interpretation, the court relied on the Supreme Court’s decision in _Brand X_, which held that the judiciary’s interpretation trumps the agency’s only if the court’s ‘construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.’



Although current Supreme Court precedent unmistakably justifies the panel’s reasoning, it is possible that the court was being modest to a fault when it refrained from adopting its own ‘best’ reading of a ‘purely’ legal question of the sort at issue in _Szony­i_. Certainly at least one Supreme Court justice thinks so. In a celebrated 2016 concurrenceinvolving a remarkably similar controversy as in _Szonyi_ , then‐​judge Neil Gorsuch expressed a deep‐​seated disagreement with the _Brand X_ reasoning that an agency’s reading of an ambiguous statute supersedes an interpretation previously reached by Article III courts. There are, of course, other indications that the current Court might have been taken a less modest approach than the Ninth Circuit panel in _Szonyi_.



In stark contrast to the court’s modesty in _Szonyi_ , consider next the late 2018 decision in _LULAC v Wheeler_, which the Ninth Circuit last month agreed to rehear _en banc_.



The controversy in _LULAC_ pertained to chlorpyrifos, which is the most widely used conventional insecticide in the country. In September 2007, environmental groups submitted a petition to the EPA, claiming that chlorpyrifos is un-‘safe’ under applicable statutes, and demanding that the agency pull the insecticide from the market. In November 2015, the EPA proposed to grant the groups’ petition. The agency, however, failed to finalize its proposal before the White House changed hands from the Obama administration to the Trump administration. In early 2017, under new political management, the EPA denied the environmental groups’ petition. On the same day they sought an administrative appeal, the environmental groups sought judicial review.



Before the Ninth Circuit, the government rested its entire defense on a jurisdictional claim involving an alleged statutory requirement for exhaustion of administrative appeals. A split panel disagreed and concluded that the case was indeed ripe. As the EPA had presented no arguments in defense of its decision, the court decided that the agency forfeited any merits‐​based argument. Nevertheless, the majority panel briefly reviewed the substance of the EPA’s 2017 denial of the environmental groups’ petition, which, in turn, was premised on the uncertainty as to the health effects of chlorpyrifos. Long story short: the court gave greater credence to the agency’s 2015 proposal and 2016 risk assessment than it did to the agency’s 2017 final determination. According to the majority panel, no matter how ‘desirable it may be for [the] EPA to consult [scientific advisors] and even to revise its conclusion in the future, that is no reason for acting against its own science findings in the meantime.’ Based on these conclusions, the court granted the petition for review and remanded to the EPA with directions to revoke all tolerances and cancel all registrations for chlorpyrifos within 60 days.



Setting aside the jurisdictional claims, the split panel’s order on the merits is troubling on many fronts.



Unlike the ‘purely’ legal provisions at issue in _Szonyi_ , the statutes at hand in _LULAC_ reflect quintessential ‘mixed’ questions of law and fact, which is generally the preserve of agencies, not courts. The statutes expressly call for the EPA administrator to make a highly technical determination whether a given insecticide is ‘safe.’ Moreover, the relevant law plainly imparts significant latitude to the administrator, who must possess a “ ** _reasonable_** certainty” the insecticide poses no harm. Phrases like ‘reasonable’ are tell‐​tale signs that Congress is imparting capacious discretion.



I’ve been following the chlorpyrifos debate, and, without question, the administrative record demonstrates scientific uncertainty. As the agency conceded in its 2016 risk reassessment, ‘the [Science Advisory Panel] … appears to have rejected… the approach the EPA put forward in its [2015] proposed rule.’ Indeed, the advisory panel never had an opportunity to vet the agency’s 2016 risk reassessment, because the clock ran out on the Obama administration. Regardless one’s values, it is indisputable that the latest scientific input to the agency reflected substantial uncertainty surrounding the health effects of chlorpyrifos.



To my eyes, the evident uncertainty regarding the health effects of chlorpyrifos represents precisely the sort of “special case” especially conducive to “a modest judicial posture,” as argued by Prof. Adrian Vermeule in _Law’s Abnegation_. As the most widely used insecticide, chlorpyrifos is an important component of the agriculture industry and, ultimately, the food supply. It follows that undue regulation may have harmful practical effects that could be worse than the purported direct harms. In this context, there is a strong case for deference, or ‘thin rationality review’ in Vermeule’s words, because such decisions are better left to comparatively expert and politically accountable agencies. On this note, it’s worth observing that the agency’s 2017 determination is arguably more politically accountable than its 2016 reassessment, as the former took place at the end of a president’s second term, while the latter occurred during a president’s first term.



Given the high stakes, the technical nature of the subject‐​matter, and the direct delegation to the EPA of an obviously ‘mixed’ legal determination, it’s a fair question whether the court unnecessarily usurped the EPA’s policymaking function as assigned by Congress. Short of pulling from shelves the most commonly used insecticide in America, the court could have ordered the government to file a brief on the merits within days. Or the court could have exercised its discretion to allow the environmental groups’ administrative appeal to finish, and thereby complete the administrative record. Or the court could have ordered the government to produce a timeline for convening a science advisory panel. To prevent the agency from dragging its feet, the court could have applied the oft‐​used _TRAC_ doctrine for judging whether agency action is unreasonably delayed. My point is that there are many judicial outcomes that are averse to the agency, but which are far more modest than what the panel did in _LULAC_. In light of these concerns, I welcome the Ninth Circuit’s decision to rehear the panel’s split decision before the full court.



In 2015, a group of children filed suit in a federal district court in Oregon, _Juliana v. US_ , alleging that the federal government, by failing to sufficiently regulate greenhouse gases, infringed on the kids’ putative constitutional right to a climate unaffected by anthropogenic global warming. After denying the federal government’s motions to dismiss and summary judgment, the case was set to go to trial before Judge Ann Aiken in October 2018. After twice denying government petitions to stay the case, the matter is now again before the Ninth Circuit on interlocutory appeal, at the strong suggestion of the Supreme Court. Expedited briefing took place last month.



For my part, I’m struck by the evident willingness of jurists within the Ninth Circuit to entertain this case, despite its far‐​reaching implications and obvious justiciability concerns. For almost three years, U.S. Oregon District Judge Aiken and two Ninth Circuit panels have contemplated having a single federal district court require the executive branch to stop global climate change. Of course, any such remedy would be untethered from the scores of enabling statutes that regulate the fossil fuel industry. By allowing this case to proceed this far, these courts countenance the creation and management of an Article III regulatory regime for the entire national economy.



The judicial immodesty evident among judges within the Ninth Circuit in _Juliana v. US_ stands in stark contrast to a February order by U.S. Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Paul Diamond, in which he dismissed a near‐​identical suit. Judge Diamond held that the Constitution does not guarantee children a right to a ‘life‐​sustaining climate system.’ After disavowing both ‘the authority [and] the inclination to assume control of the Executive Branch,’ Judge Diamond concluded that climate change regulation ‘is a policy debate best left to the political process.’



With all due respect to judicial and learned opinions to the contrary, I think Judge Diamond gets it right.

Australia’s most “progressive” state, which last year re-elected its socialist premier, will be very lucky not to reap what it has sown, this summer.



The Victorian government is vying with South Australia to be the most idiotically dedicated to the ideological fanaticism of pursuing “renewables” at any cost. South Australia is furthest down the primrose path: its electricity prices are the highest in Australia. In 2016, the entire state was blacked out.



But lucky Victorians are fast catching up. Victorian electricity bills have soared to second-most-expensive in the nation. Last summer, the state experienced rolling blackouts on the hottest days of the year. Now that Victoria has recklessly closed yet another reliable coal-fired station, the state will be in an even more precarious situation when this summer’s heatwaves hit.



Victoria’s gas ban and high renewable energy targets have placed its power grid in a precarious position this summer, potentially leading to “contagion” with other states, Energy Minister Angus Taylor has warned. After Federal Labor’s resources spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon urged the Andrews Labor government to immediately lift its moratorium on conventional gas exploration saying the policy makes “neither economic nor environmental sense”, Mr Taylor also urged the southern state to reconsider its policy stance.



“We’ve got a situation where a major baseload generator has been taken out of the market in Hazelwood. We’ve got a ban on gas and we’ve got a very aggressive renewable energy target,” Mr Taylor said. “So that’s a precarious grid that faces serious risks, both this summer and incoming summers.”



However, the Victorian government hit back, saying…“We know that privately owned ageing coal fired power stations are unreliable and continue to fail and that’s why our investment in renewables is so important,” a Victorian government spokesperson said.



They continue to fail because government meddling has distorted the market beyond all sense, and made it unfeasible for energy companies to invest in the upkeep of conventional power stations.



Tasmania experienced just the sort of dire situation that climate-hysterical energy policies lead to, in 2016. The perverse incentive of the Gillard carbon tax encouraged the Hydro authority to virtually empty the state’s dams in order to chase a windfall gain by selling the energy to the Mainland. When the usual rains failed that winter, the state was left with the very real risk of environmental disaster. When the BassLink undersea cable broke, Tasmania was left without any means of securing electricity supplies if the Hydro ran dry.



Victoria is dancing a similar dangerous line, this summer, with two major conventional generators offline.



Outages at AGL Energy’s Loy Yang A coal plant and Origin Energy’s Mortlake gas generator have led to concerns Victoria faces a significant risk of power outages this summer.



…Adding to tensions are longer-term concerns the state’s 50 per cent renewable target by 2030 may force out major coal generators like Yallourn in the Latrobe Valley which supplies 22 per cent of Victoria’s electricity and 8 per cent of the national market.



If Victoria and South Australia both go dark in the summer heat, the contagion will spread to the rest of the Mainland states. But it is the “progressive” ninnies in those states who will suffer the most, as they reap the whirlwind of their hysterical virtue-signalling.



It should be most entertaining to watch.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has been steadily increasing since regular measurements began at the Mauna Loa Observatory. This increase is partially driven by fossil fuel use but the year to year rate of increase is driven by ocean temperature. This was discussed in October 2012 here.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) tracks fossil fuel use and has reported here that emissions due to fossil fuels have flatlined for the last two years. Actually, it has nearly flatlined for the last four years according to their own figures. The increase from 2011 to 2012 was less than 0.5%, and from 2012 to 2013 it decreased by 0.03%.

Figure 1 is a plot of annual world fossil fuel CO2 emissions since 1980 from IEA.
In that time, CO2 in the atmosphere has grown from 338 parts per million (ppm) to 398 ppm. In the next figure, that quantity has been converted to metric tonnage.

Figure 2 is the accumulated emissions compared to accumulated CO2. 
Note that only about half the emissions have stayed in the atmosphere. The remainder has been absorbed somewhere else.

Figure 3 is a plot of annual Carbon Dioxide emissions, the annual uptake by the biosphere, and the resulting atmospheric CO2 concentration, with projections of each into the future.

Figure 4. Estimated changes in vegetative cover due to CO2 fertilization between 1982 and 2010 (Donohue et al., 2013 GRL). For a discussion of this image and other similar images see Roy Spencer here.
The “somewhere else” is the biosphere, the “greening” of global photosynthetic life along with absorption by the oceans. Each year, on average, those sinks take up 251.35 million extra metric tonnes of CO2 as the biosphere pulls things back into balance. That sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that the atmosphere contains more than 3 trillion tonnes of CO2, land based vegetation about 4 trillion tonnes, the surface ocean something like 5 trillion tonnes, and the deep ocean 150 trillion tonnes. The total annual flux from atmosphere to the biosphere and back is about 400 billion tonnes. So that annual difference is only about 0.5%. (I am using the American counting system: 106 is a million, 109 a billion, 1012 a trillion. I’m also using the weight of CO2, not just the carbon atoms.)
The uptake decreases with increasing temperature. The downward spike in uptake in 1998 was due to the El Niño of that year. The increase in uptake in 1992 and 1993 was due to the Mount Pinatubo cooling. The uptake also increases with increasing CO2. On average, the uptake is increasing. Over the last 35 years, it has increased by 251.35 million extra tonnes per year.
If this increase holds, and the global fossil fuel emissions remain constant at the same level as the last four years, the uptake will equal the emissions late in this century, in about 2083. At that time, CO2 in the atmosphere will reach a maximum at about 475 ppm and begin to decrease. In my humble opinion, this projection is pessimistic. If emissions are reduced below the current level, the date and level of the maximum will be earlier and lower. If ocean temperatures decrease, the same thing will happen. If warming occurs, and/or emissions increase, the date of the maximum will be pushed toward 2100, and the maximum level will be slightly higher. Ocean temperature is a positive feedback on CO2 increase and a negative feedback on CO2 uptake. A cooler ocean takes up more CO2, a warmer ocean less.
The current policies in most developed countries are toward lowering emissions. To date, these policies have been successful in holding emissions at the current level for the last four years. If governments allow the development of nuclear power, other renewables increase in a non-destructive fashion, and if natural gas continues to replace coal-fired power plants, carbon dioxide emissions will likely fall below the current level. This will pull the CO2 peak to an earlier date and a lower level. That date is where emissions cross the uptake trend line. Here is my optimistic view: If emissions fall back to the level of the year 2000 by 2050, looking at Figure 3, one can imagine that the CO2 level will peak at about 450 ppm near that year and fall after that.
What will this do to global warming? The slight increase in CO2 induced warming might just offset the coming sun-induced cooling. Perhaps we will have a century of constant temperature.

Damon Linker writes at THE WEEK:
Is National Review doomed?
The conservative movement’s leading magazine faces a lawsuit that could bring it to its knees.
This part made me laugh: 
The ideological descendants of the Birchers have since taken their revenge. Today they are the conservative movement’s most passionate supporters and foot soldiers. But they demand a steady diet of red meat, and National Review now exists in part to provide it.
Really? John Birchers?
Here’s a somewhat less volatile point of his argument, but still equally funny:
‘In July, Judge Natalia Combs Greene rejected a motion to dismiss the suit. The defendants appealed, and last week D.C. Superior Court Judge Frederick Weisberg rejected the motion again, opening the door for the discovery phase of the lawsuit to begin’
I guess he didn’t do much research into that fiasco and judge Natalia Combs Greene to see the whole story of how she reversed the plaintiff and the defendant in her ruling, which was later nullified by a competent judge.
Let’s say for the sake of entertainment purposes that Mann does win the lawsuit, how will he prove damages? Given Mann’s own propensity for self promotion, vitriol, and foot-in-mouth moments, IMHO Mann does more damage to his own reputation than anyone else. If Mann winning that lawsuit that were to happen, it would probably be a symbolic damages award, like $1. If the judge really wanted to send a message about frivolous lawsuits from climate scientists, he could make it 97 cents.
Read it all here: http://theweek.com//article/index/255756/is-national-review-doomed
But, the funniest part of it all, is the writer himself, Damon Linker, who could be a every-Mann climate scientist clone.

 _Global Science Report_ _is a feature from the_ _Center for the Study of Science_ _, where we highlight one or two important new items in the scientific literature or the popular media. For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly “Current Wisdom.”_   




Hermanson and colleagues identified the “North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre” (SPG) as a key factor which influences a variety of weather patterns from North America to Europe. The SPG is a collection of processes most readily manifest in the variability of the average sea surface temperature in an area extending in latitude from 50°N to 66°N and in longitude from 60°W to 10°W. Variability in the SPG has been associated with precipitation and temperature patterns across the in the U.S., Europe, and North Africa, as well as hurricane frequency in the Atlantic Ocean.   
  
The relationship between the SPG and hurricanes was pointed out back in 2001 in a prominent paper in _Science_ magazine by a team of leading hurricane researchers including Stanley Goldenberg, Chris Landsea and William Gray. This team countered the prevailing (in the popular press anyway) and rather shrilly-delivered hypothesis that the upturn in hurricane activity which began in the mid-1990s was caused by anthropogenic global warming. In their paper, Goldenberg and colleagues pointed out that, no, it wasn’t. Rather than global warming, the patterns of hurricane frequency were driven by naturally occurring variability in the patterns of sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic (related to the SPG). And since this variability takes place over multidecadal timescales, conditions conducive to elevated hurricane activity in the Atlantic Ocean would be with us for a while (a couple of decades or so beginning in the mid-1990s). Despite this explanation/warning from these prominent scientists, determined parties did not stop blaming each and every hurricane on global warming.   
  
Now, according to the DePreSys model run by Hermanson and colleagues, this favorable hurricane environment is projected to start to draw to an end—a result of a forecasted weakening of the SPG leading to cooler sea surface temperatures in the upper the North Atlantic.   
  
Figure 1 below shows the 5-year running average of tropical cyclone numbers in the Atlantic Ocean since 1960 along with the DePreSys model hindcasts and forecasts. The model projects that the elevated hurricane numbers characteristic of the past two decades will fall back towards normal over the next few years.   
  
[caption]  




Figure 1. Tropical storm counts for storms in the latitude band 5°N-25°N in the Atlantic that last more than two days (HURDAT2 are the observations). The year indicates the central year of the five-year mean. The 50% probability spread of the hindcasts/forecasts is indicated by the vertical lines (from Hermanson et al., 2014).[/caption]   
  
The authors note that the decline in hurricane numbers occurs as a result of a combination of internal (natural processes) as well as a bit of an influence from anthropogenic climate change—an influence which is projected to mount a downward pressure on Atlantic hurricane numbers going forward.   
  
Now we know—a near normal numbers of hurricanes for the next couple of years would be “consistent with” model forecasts including the influence of global warming.   
  
So in the event of above normal hurricane counts during the next couple of years, one thing we know _a priori_ , is that such an occurrence is NOT consistent with anthropogenic climate change.   
  
Make sure to remember this when reading all the stories that will certainly proclaim the contrary. If history is any guide to the future, it is likely that some such stories will emanate from the White House in its zeal to dredge up support for its Climate Action Plan and any carbon dioxide restrictions that it can squeeze out—despite the ineffectiveness of any such restrictions on altering the course of future climate, including Atlantic hurricanes.

"**Bonheur Malenga, a Congolese university student, found himself facing a dilemma one day last month about whether to purchase online data.**
""As I was hungry, I didn't know if I should buy food or get a 24-hour internet bundle,"" he told the BBC.
The 27-year-old, who is studying engineering, relies on his parents for financial support - but has been spending more than usual as he has been doing research online for his final-year dissertation.
He lives in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 26% of average monthly income is spent on getting online using mobiles - the easiest way to access the internet here.
""I told myself that staying hungry for a day and a night wouldn't kill me. So, I just bought the internet bundle and slept on an empty stomach,"" he said.
Mr Malenga says many of his friends face the same dilemma.
DR Congo is classed as the most expensive country to get online in the world, according to the 2019 Affordability Report from the Alliance for Affordable Internet.
The organisation determines affordable internet as paying 2% or less of your average monthly income for 1GB of mobile broadband data.
On the other side of the country, more than 2,000km (about 1,240 miles) east of Kinshasa, Eric Kasinga remembers an embarrassing moment that happened to him a few years ago.
Like many young people living in the town of Bukavu, he had to go to a cybercafÃ© to get online. He was applying for a postgraduate course at a reputable university in The Netherlands.
""The internet was so slow that the whole application process ended up taking three hours instead of one,"" he says.
But he only had enough money to pay for an hour.
He explained the situation to the cybercafÃ© manager, hoping he would be allowed to bring the money later.
However, the manager started shouting curses at him, screaming: ""The internet is not for poor people.""
For payment, the manager pulled off the new shoes Mr Kasinga was wearing, forcing him to walk the long distance home barefoot.
""I felt terribly ashamed,"" he says.
The graduate, who now works for a conservation organisation, was never able to follow up on his university application. He did try to get his shoes back later that week, but the cybercafÃ© manager had already sold them.
""Nobody should have to experience this just for internet,"" he says.
DR Congo is the fourth-most populated country in Africa, two-thirds the size of western Europe and is rich in the minerals used to make smartphones.
Yet many of its citizens have a hard time accessing basic services such as proper healthcare, drinking water and electricity.
For them, accessing the internet, recognised by the UN as a human right in July 2016, is regarded as a luxury.
The Congolese Post and Telecommunications Regulation Authority (ARPTC) estimates that only 17% of population has online access.
Another recent report also points the growing digital gender gap. More than 33.8% of men compared to 22.6% of women in Africa have online access, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) said.
Kodjo Ndukuma, an expert on digital rights at Kinshasa's UniversitÃ© PÃ©dagogique Nationale (UPN), says there are three main reasons for the high costs of the internet.
**1\. Nobody knows exactly how much it should cost**
""The modelling of cost is done when you make calculations based on investments put in by a telecom company, the running cost and the number of subscribers,"" he says.
These calculations have been made for voice calls but no telecommunication company has done that for internet data, meaning the regulator cannot put a cap on prices.
""The lack of a clear ceiling gives companies freedom to fix whatever price they want,"" says Prof Kojdo.
**2\. A lack of competition**
The number of subscribers and the number of telecom firms has remained stagnant for many years - limiting competition.
""All it takes is for this small number of companies to agree on one thing and nobody can stop them,"" says Prof Kojdo.
He gave the example of April 2016 when all the Congolese telecommunication companies, bar one, agreed to increase the price of mobile data by 500%.
**3\. Over taxation**
""Telecommunication companies pay taxes on the national, provincial and sometimes local levels,"" says the professor.
""They just put it on the heads of subscribers.""

The government is facing pressure to intervene, following protests by a youth movement known as La Lucha.
Between March and October, the group, acting as a de facto consumer rights organisation, held 11 demonstrations across the country calling for internet data costs to be lowered.
""The regulatory authority told us in a meeting that there are legal limits as to how far they can interfere in the operations of telecom companies,"" said Bienvenu Matumo from La Lucha.
""Still, we want the government to do something instead of watching us being scammed.""
The information technology minister was the one who called on the regulator, La Lucha and the telecoms firms to meet and thrash out a solution - the government itself is not allowed by law to interfere.
But the first meeting failed to come up with concrete steps to reduce the costs or improve the quality of internet services.
For businesswoman Vanessa Baya any improvement on the current situation cannot come too soon.
She runs a marketing business and relies on the internet to reach her clients.
""The quality of the internet network is so unreliable that I have to switch between more than two different telecom operators in a single day,"" she says.
That means buying extra data bundles for each operator, sacrificing other needs. But this does not solve her problems as she is not able to shoulder the cost of her customers.
""Even if I get online and share the catalogue of products with clients, they rarely download it, fearing it may eat up all their data."""
"Tackling the global nature crisis could create 400m jobs and $10tn (£8tn) in business value each year by 2030, according to a report published by the World Economic Forum. The report warns that when the world recovers from the coronavirus pandemic there can be no business-as-usual, with today’s destruction of the natural world threatening over half of global GDP. In 2019 scientists warned that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems.  The report, from the New Nature Economy project, published by the WEF, says a nature-first approach from business and political leaders will be a jobs-first solution. “There will be no jobs or prosperity on a dead planet,” said Alan Jope, chief executive of Unilever and a WEF partner. WEF, which brings together leaders and hosts the annual Davos summit, said three sectors were responsible for endangering 80% of threatened species – food and land use, infrastructure and building, and energy and mining. But it said these sectors also had the most to gain from a nature-led recovery. The report says: “We are reaching irreversible tipping points for nature and climate. If recovery efforts do not address the looming planetary crises, a critical window of opportunity to avoid their worst impact will be irreversibly lost. Decisions on how to deploy the post-Covid crisis stimulus packages will likely shape societies and economies for decades.” Akanksha Khatri, head of WEF’s Nature Action Agenda, said: “Nature can provide the jobs our economies need. There is nothing stopping businesses and governments from implementing these plans today, at scale, to re-employ millions.” Carlos Alvarado Quesada, president of Costa Rica, said: “We must use the coronavirus crisis as an opportunity to reset humanity’s relationship with nature. [My country] has shown that the transition to a carbon-neutral, nature-positive, economy brings greater prosperity and jobs. It’s time to mainstream this model.” Many high-level observers, including economists, health professionals, climate experts, and developing countries, have urged governments and business to pursue a green recovery but largely focused on tackling the climate emergency. Another report in July concluded that almost a third of the world’s land and oceans could be protected while bolstering the economy. The UN has also warned that the world is currently only treating the health and economic symptoms of the pandemic, not the cause – the environmental destruction. The WEF report proposes a range of measures for boosting jobs and economies, such as cutting food waste by providing metal silos and crates to keep food from rotting. Better management of wild fish too could boost catches and add 14m jobs and $170bn in value, it says. It is also vital to end the $2bn subsidies given daily to agriculture which damage the planet, the WEF report says. “This expenditure of public money is actually creating harmful effects on the public good,” said Khatri. “Something is significantly broken in our system.” In cities, retrofitting to increase energy efficiency could save $825bn by 2030, the report says, while the market for urban green roofs is already worth $9bn and could grow rapidly. Renewable energy is also a huge investment opportunity and already matches the cost of fossil fuels in 30 countries, while the use of human sewage as an energy source is rising. WEF acknowledged that some workers would lose their jobs in unsustainable industries and urged governments to ensure people were retrained and that the transition to a green economy was fair to all. It estimates that $2.7tn of annual investment is required to fund all the opportunities identified in the report, a sum similar to the stimulus package announced by the US in March. Jennifer Morris, head of The Nature Conservancy, a US based organisation, said: “Nature simply cannot afford for us to waste any more time. None of this will be easy, system change at this scale never is. But WEF’s report underlines that it is our collective responsibility to transform the ways in which we eat, live, grow, build, and power our lives.”"
"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Donald Trump got into Twitter spats with the Iranian government, the University of California, Berkeley and Arnold Schwarzenegger. The issues ranged from missile tests to free speech to TV ratings. Speaking to a gathering of religious leaders in Washington, Mr. Trump brushed aside criticism and pledged to “destroy” a law restricting political speech by   churches, a potentially huge victory for the religious right. Late Thursday, he unexpectedly shifted his stance on Israel, warning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on settlement construction. _____ 2. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited South Korea, his first stop on an Asia trip meant to reassure U. S. allies. But his visit was overshadowed by news of Mr. Trump’s testy phone call with the leader of Australia over the weekend. He clashed with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over an agreement to take in 1, 250 refugees. European leaders are gathering in Malta to discuss a crisis that has unexpectedly overtaken the agenda: the newly unpredictable United States. _____ 3. The administration amended its immigration order to allow U. S. entry to the families of Iraqi interpreters who served the U. S. government and military forces. But tumult over the order continued. The C. E. O. of Uber is stepping down from the president’s economic advisory council, saying he did not want his participation to be mistaken for support. Somali refugees in Kenya suddenly robbed of hope say they fear reprisals from   militants. And tens of thousands of people from the seven countries named in the executive order are effectively stuck in the U. S. because the State Department revoked their visas  —   without notifying them. _____ 4. It isn’t clear exactly what happened during the   standoff at a prison in Smyrna, Del. But when authorities used a backhoe to storm it at dawn, they found a hostage corrections officer unresponsive. He was quickly pronounced dead. Sgt. Steven Floyd had worked for the Department of Correction for 16 years. Details of his death were not released, and officials said they were treating all 120 inmates as suspects. A woman who worked as a counselor was not only unharmed, she had been protected by the inmates. The inmates’ grievances included allegations of mistreatment and a lack of educational and rehabilitation programs. _____ 5. Several community groups in Michigan and Minnesota are rejecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal aid to fight violent extremism. The money comes from Homeland Security grants to counter recruitment by terrorist and white supremacist groups. But the community groups are reacting to reports that the Trump administration is considering reshaping the program to target only Muslims. _____  6. The Super Bowl, scheduled for Sunday night in Houston, is infused with national politics like never before. During Fox’s pregame telecast, Bill O’Reilly will interview Mr. Trump, who is a friend of the Patriots’ owner, coach and star player. There may be protests outside the stadium, or at the halftime show. Lady Gaga remained coy about the plans for her halftime performance. Fox and the N. F. L. are trying to keep game commercials apolitical. A lumber company’s ad depicting a mother and daughter who encounter a wall during an arduous journey north was nixed. _____ 7. Snapchat’s parent company filed paperwork for its public stock offering. While the filing does not indicate a price for an initial public offering, Snap is expected to seek a market valuation of more than $20 billion from investors. The move puts the company’s    chief executive, Evan Spiegel, in the spotlight. The chairman of Google is calling him the next Gates or Zuckerberg. _____ 8. “ . ” That’s our critic, describing “I Am Not Your Negro,” a new documentary about James Baldwin. “Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called ‘race relations’  —   white supremacy and the resistance to it, in plainer English  —   this movie will make you think again, and may even change your mind. ” _____ 9. A happy ending: A woman gravely injured in the Boston Marathon bombing is about to marry the firefighter who rescued her. This week, they both walked up the 1, 576 steps of the Empire State Building, she with a prosthetic leg and he with his firefighting gear on, to benefit the Challenged Athlete Foundation. _____ 10. Finally, new research suggests a surprising function for sleep: to forget. Pruning synapses that grow exuberantly to store the day’s memories appears to be a biological necessity, protecting important moments but making space for new knowledge in the brain’s hard drive. “You can forget in a smart way,” one researcher said. Hope you get some rest. Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

"Something magical appeared at night over London and other parts of Britain on 21 June: ripples of electric blue clouds shimmered in the twilight sky after sunset. These were noctilucent clouds, the highest clouds in the world, more than 80km (50 miles) up on the edge of space, and looked like something from another planet. Noctilucent clouds form in the mesosphere, the rarefied upper atmosphere with little moisture and intensely low temperatures. The scant water vapour there can freeze on to specks of smoke from meteors burning up in the atmosphere, creating the crystals that form noctilucent clouds. The mesosphere is coldest in summer, allowing the crystals to form.  These clouds may also be a warning sign of the climate crisis. They were first recorded in 1885 and were rarely seen for years afterwards, largely in polar regions. But in recent times the clouds have appeared much further afield and are growing much brighter.  Much of the moisture needed to form the clouds comes from methane, a potent greenhouse gas that produces water vapour when it breaks down in the upper atmosphere. And as methane pollution has increased, so noctilucent clouds have grown more common and more widespread."
"A summer of civil unrest. A global climate strike bringing millions of people to the streets. A stark warning from scientists that climate breakdown is accelerating, and that we must triple our climate ambition at the very least. All of the conditions were there for this year’s UN Climate Action Summit to be a turning point in the climate crisis. But after 24 years of inaction by governments on climate breakdown, it’s hard to feel surprised that the moment never arrived. In fact, the summit was an abject failure.

      Don't bet on the UN to fix climate change – it's failed for 30 years


 Almost 80 countries pledged to reach “net zero” – that is, to balance carbon emissions with carbon removal – by 2050. But not only is this number far too little too late given the state of the science, none of the major carbon polluters made any significantly improved commitments. US President Donald Trump – who previously pulled the country out of the Paris Agreement – briefly dropped by before moving on to the religious freedom, anti-abortion summit he had pledged to attend. His main contribution was to mock Greta Thunberg’s impassioned speech to world leaders at the start of the summit. You’d have thought that the EU would seize the opportunity to finally announce a unified commitment to net zero by 2050. But it had little more to offer than highlighting that most of its members supported the goal, and offering vague suggestions that it would at some point improve its current commitment of a 40% cut in emissions by 2030. Even this goal is unlikely to get past the veto power of Poland, a significant coal producer determined to defend what it sees as its economic interests. China, as the world’s biggest polluter, made no significant pledges nor commitments at the summit. The country did suggest that it would demonstrate “the highest possible ambition” when reviewing its climate commitments next year. But it argued that the US and the EU needed to lead on making significant reductions because of their historical responsibility for emissions. China also suggested it would use its massive Belt and Road initiative – aimed at building infrastructure networks across the globe – to tackle climate change, despite the project being linked to a massive expansion in carbon emissions. This lack of concrete action by those most responsible for our planetary predicament was starkly contrasted by commitments from countries at the other end of the spectrum. The world’s “least developed countries” (LDCs) said that all 47 of its members would commit to net zero emissions by 2050, despite being least responsible for carbon emissions, and often still suffering the legacies of colonialism, slavery, and structural adjustment programmes – that is, enforced privatisation of major industries and programmes of austerity –  inflicted by the world’s wealthiest nations.

      Not convinced on the need for urgent climate action? Here's what happens to our planet between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming


 But despite unprecedented strikes, protests and scientific warnings, most countries, cities and companies did not unite behind UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ call for a collective commitment to net zero by 2050. Worse still, there was a near complete absence of commitment to immediate action. To have a reasonable chance of limit global heating to 1.5℃ – a level above which the effects of climate breakdown become dramatically more severe – we need to cut emissions by between 10 and 20% per year at the very least, starting in a couple of years at the latest. Were those wealthy countries most responsible for climate change to take on a fair, increased share of reductions, they would need to cut their carbon footprint by 24% a year. This amounts to a 75% cut in the next five years for countries such as the UK. To kickstart this process, Guterres wanted world leaders to tackle subsidies for fossil fuels, implement taxes on carbon, and end new coal power beyond 2020. This did not happen. India, China and Turkey are all still planning to expand coal power well beyond 2020. Fossil fuel subsidies are still growing – and so is production. New carbon taxes are nowhere to be seen.

      2050 is too late – we must drastically cut emissions much sooner


 Even countries with net-zero pledges in line with the UN’s 2050 call are nowhere near on track to realise them. The UK, for example, is forging ahead with plans for a third runway at Heathrow, supporting fracking and opening coal mines. As it stands, we’re still on track for a catastrophic 3℃ to 4℃ of global heating by 2100. And after 24 years of abject failure, it’s clear that if there is any chance of halting global heating, it won’t be enough to just take to the streets. People will have to take matters into their own hands, and find new ways to bring about a just transition to a zero-carbon future – despite the efforts of their governments.

"Plastic pollution and the climate crisis are two inseparable parts of the same problem, though they aren’t treated as such. Many countries have implemented plastic bag charges and plastic straw bans while action to phase out fossil fuels lags far behind, due in part to the inertia of the huge oil and gas companies that dominate the sector.  An investigation by The Guardian recently found that just 20 of these firms are responsible for 35% of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. How will they adapt as fossil fuel demand wanes with the rise of renewable energy and battery power? The answer is plastic – and that shift is already well underway. Most of the plastic that exists today has been made in the last decade. The environment appears to be drowning in plastic for the same reason that global temperatures continue to rise – fossil fuels have remained cheap and abundant. Cheap plastic is made using chemicals produced in the process of making fuel. Petroleum refining transforms crude oil extracted from the ground into gasoline, producing ethane as a byproduct. A decade ago, the advent of fracking – hydraulic fracturing of oil or natural gas – made the raw materials for plastics significantly cheaper.  Fracking shale gas produces lots of ethane, which is turned into ethylene – the building block for many hard-to-recycle plastic products, like packaging films, sachets and bottles. Cheap polyethylene from fracking created a glut of plastic packaging on supermarket shelves that sociologist Rebecca Altman has called “frackaging”. There are few facilities worldwide that can dispose of or recycle this kind of plastic efficiently. They’re expensive to set up and run and there’s little demand for using the recycled material to make new products. While packaging is the single largest source of plastic demand, most of that is thrown away as soon as it’s removed, with one third of it estimated to go directly to domestic waste and either incineration or landfill. In much of the world, a lot of it goes directly into the environment.  Reducing fuel consumption won’t necessarily solve the plastic problem. Global plastic production is expected to double in the next 15 years even as demand for gasoline wanes. In 2017, 50% of all crude oil produced worldwide was refined into fuel for transport, most as gasoline. Electric vehicles and more efficient forms of public transport mean gasoline demand is falling. The oil and gas companies who own these refineries are instead gearing up to turn what is now excess fuel into plastics for packaging. As demand for gasoline continues to decline in future, more plastics will be made directly from crude oil. Petroleum companies now plan to convert up to 40% of the crude oil they intend to extract into petrochemicals. These are chemicals like acetylene, benzene, ethane, ethylene, methane, propane, and hydrogen, which form the basis for thousands of other products, including plastics.  The industry predicts petrochemicals will grow from 16% of oil demand in 2020 to 20% by 2040 largely to supply the feedstocks for making plastics. The environmental consequences of making even more plastic from crude oil will be significant. More plastic pollution will enter watercourses and the ocean, while amping up production will accelerate global emissions.

      Plastic warms the planet twice as much as aviation – here's how to make it climate-friendly


 That’s because making plastic releases carbon dioxide (CO₂). Both transporting the crude oil to make it and then disposing of the plastic by incineration generates emissions. Most of the estimated total natural capital cost of plastic pollution – USD$75 billion per year for the consumer goods sector alone – arises from CO₂ emissions linked to producing and transporting plastic.  Expanding plastic production and sending more plastic either directly to incineration or to waste-to-energy facilities - where plastics are turned into oil and used to generate electricity or heat – mean CO₂ emissions from plastic are expected to triple by 2050 to 309m metric tonnes. Incinerating mountains of plastic waste could become one of the largest sources of C0₂ emissions in Europe’s energy sector as fossil fuels are phased out. Halving the use of petroleum-based plastic packaging by 2030 and phasing it out altogether by 2050 could ensure CO₂ emissions targets are still met. Achieving net zero emissions from incinerating plastic packaging means eliminating all non-essential uses of petroleum-based plastic by 2035, following a peak in packaging and other single use, disposable plastics in 2025. Replacing traditional plastics with new materials made from renewable sources like corn starch could help, as could developing a new infrastructure for industrial plastic composting.  In a climate crisis, plastic waste doesn’t look like the world’s most pressing environmental problem. But considering plastic and climate as two separate issues is a mistake. Concern about plastic pollution isn’t distracting people from a more serious problem – plastic is the problem. If we see plastics as “solid climate change”, they become central to the climate crisis.  Click here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

In February 2012, General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained, “I can’t impress upon you that in my personal military judgment, formed over 38 years, we are living in the most dangerous time in my lifetime, right now.” He was born in 1952. In 2013, he upped the ante: “I will personally attest to the fact that [the world is] more dangerous than it has ever been.”



He is scarcely alone—or unusual. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, born in 1941, has testified that he has never “experienced a time when we’ve been beset by more crises and threats around the globe.”1 Sen. Lindsey Graham, born in 1955, explains, “I’ve never seen the world more dangerous than it is now.”2 From his perch on two congressional committees tasked with keeping Americans safe, Rep. Michael Turner, born in 1960, proclaims, “The security environment is more dangerous and more uncertain than ever before.”3 Sen. Jim Inhofe, ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, says he is unable to recall “a time in my life where the world has been more dangerous and the threats more diverse.”4 His Senate colleague, John McCain, born, like Inhofe, before World War II, agrees, “The world is a more dangerous place than I have seen,” and quietly adds the proviso “in many respects.”5



Such extravagant proclamations occasionally do generate some pushback.6 And a few systematic efforts emerged to examine and to warn against the dangers of threat inflation.7 However, for the most part, the alarmist pronouncements go rather blandly accepted and uncountered. The Defense Department’s Threat Reduction Agency never seems to come out with reports observing that there may not be, actually, all that many threats out there to reduce. 



One could say that fear and anxiety are baked into our DNA. Our distant ancestors correctly perceived that a four‐​legged creature charging at them from a distance might be dangerous, and they were impelled by such emotions either to flee or to defend themselves. Thus, they lived to procreate. But getting the threats right is important. Unnecessary and excessive fear can be harmful to health and emotional well‐​being. Indeed, fully 18 percent of Americans already suffer from at least one form of anxiety disorder.8 Individual liberty can be threatened as well. Thus, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, James Madison noted what he called “a universal truth”: “The loss of liberty at home is to be charged to provisions against danger real or pretended from abroad.”9 Or, as noted writer and social critic H. L. Mencken acerbically declared, “The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary.”10



The unkind might be inclined to suggest that General Dempsey and the many politicians and administrators who agree with his alarmism are motivated by political or institutional self‐​interest. However, it is highly important to evaluate their proclamations carefully. Do we live in a world that is uniquely or especially dangerous? From wars between states to wars within them, from crime and terrorism to climate change and cyber‐​mischief, we are beset by a seemingly endless array of threats and dangers. But is it possible that there is something to Mencken’s quip? Are many or most of the threats so prominently espied and promoted “imaginary”? This book seeks to carry out that task of evaluation. 



The contributors ask to what degree, if any, the United States is actually threatened. Most of them argue that—from the standpoint of American national security— the world is safe and growing safer and that Americans enjoy a measure of security that our ancestors would envy and that many of our contemporaries do envy. 



They approach that question from different angles, considering both the multiplicity of supposed threats and the wisdom or folly of the measures proposed to deal with them. They seek to put today’s perceived threats and dangers in full context and consider as well those that no longer loom. Together, they chip away at the common perception that U.S. national security is severely threatened and getting worse.11



The book begins with the two chapters about nuclear weapons. It examines fears that such weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists or other nonstate actors—or that ever more countries will acquire them. In his chapter, Francis Gavin shows that such fears are not new and muses over the paradox that, although the threat of nuclear catastrophe “has decreased enormously,” alarmism about nuclear weapons persists. Some of this alarmism, he suggests, has been impelled by the fact that the United States has been concerned that the proliferation of such weapons might limit its own ambitions. He hopes that a better understanding of the history surrounding the weapons—including the impact that they have had on international relations—might produce better policy and calm public and official fears. 



John Mueller agrees. Fears of rampant nuclear proliferation ignore the fact that most countries have never seriously aspired to possess such weapons, as well as that those countries that have taken them on have found them to be more trouble than they are worth. Moreover, the effects of the proliferation that has taken place have been substantially benign: possessors have “used” the weapons simply “to stoke their egos and to deter real or imagined threats.” However, aggressive attempts to stop proliferation have resulted in the deaths of tens or hundreds of thousands. Meanwhile, terrorist and other nonstate actors have exhibited only limited desire to attain a nuclear capacity, and they will confront monumental difficulties if they try to do so. 



For many, the single greatest state‐​based threat emanates from China—a country of sufficient size and potential wealth to directly challenge the United States in the future. Lyle Goldstein is sensitive to such concerns, and he considers some of the specifics of China’s military modernization, as well as the potential geopolitical flashpoints that could, in worst‐​case scenarios, lead to war. On balance, Goldstein suggests that U.S. policymakers’ reaction to China’s emergence as a global threat is premature and may prove counterproductive. Rather than seeking excuses to contain China’s rise on the assumption that such a rise will inevitably lead to conflict, Goldstein urges the United States instead to exploit opportunities for collaboration and cooperation. Any “actual threat” from China “is minimal,” he argues. Although there are insecurities and problems, China is neither out to attack the United States nor out to conquer East Asia, and any risks “can be mitigated quite easily” with appropriate hedging policies. Indeed, to the extent that legitimate dangers exist in the world, the two countries have many reasons to work together to reduce or eliminate them. 



Three chapters consider nonstate and “substate” threats around the world including terrorism, insurgency, revolution, rebellion, crime, and general disorder. 



Paul Pillar observes that these threats pale in comparison to traditional state threats, and he urges readers to reexamine their preconceived notions of what is required to keep the United States both safe and free. He voices dismay at the tendency to espy monsters abroad and then to “conceive of America’s place in the world largely as one of confrontation against them.” Noting a disconnect between how much alarm substate conflicts abroad often generate and how much danger they actually pose to U.S. interests, Pillar examines three varieties: the potential overthrow of a friendly regime, direct threats to the United States by substate groups, and trouble stemming from internal disorder itself. He cautions that the capacity of the United States to curb substate conflict is usually very limited and that intervention can often prove to be counterproductive or otherwise damaging. 



Austin Long notes that concerns about a range of substate actors— rebels, terrorists, and bandits—are not new. However, in the aftermath of 9/11, the United States has greatly overestimated the threat they pose and has worked “harder, not smarter” to combat them. Although some new technologies enable substate actors to pose a greater threat than in the past, it is hardly an existential one. Moreover, technology actually affords crucial advantages to states if it is used wisely. 



Peter Andreas questions whether crime poses a greater threat today than in the past because of the far‐​reaching effects of globalization. Individuals with nefarious intentions have always been adept at exploiting new technologies, advances in communications, increases in ease of travel, and enhanced access to information, but it is not clear that new technologies allow criminals to do harm on a greater scale than before. Moreover, police and other law enforcement officials, then and now, can use these same technologies to defeat the criminals. Furthermore, criminals have strong incentive to remain separate and disconnected, and accordingly they are unlikely to band together and thereby create a substantial security threat. They scarcely pose a “power shift,” notes Andreas, in which they are “overpowering and bypassing states.” 



Four chapters examine nontraditional security threats. 



Numerous U.S. officials have warned that cyberattacks, perpetrated by either state or nonstate actors, are the single greatest threat to U.S. national security—even, according to some, to the “world system.” Martin Libicki considers these claims. He finds that, although hackers and criminals are adept at exploiting the vulnerabilities in computer networks, remarkably few attacks have been effective. Moreover, it is extremely difficult to carry out an attack that has far‐​reaching consequences. The most probable attacks, in fact, would be “more like a crime than a national security event,” inflicting relatively low economic costs and few, if any, casualties. Libicki advises policymakers to focus on appropriate responses to possible attacks because poorly conceived, badly executed, and overreactive policies might cause more harm than the precipitating incident. It is also important to track possible cyberattacks to their true source, thus ensuring that punishment or retaliation is visited on the correct perpetrators. 



Others worry about the national security risks posed by climate change. Mark Stewart considers those risks in context. Although the potential effects of climate change—including melting polar ice, rising sea levels, and other weather and environmental effects—could have national security implications, these effects will occur gradually, giving the United States ample time to adapt. Stewart assesses the likely costs of such adaptation strategies and concludes that they are modest relative to those imposed by traditional security threats. 



In their chapters, Michael Cohen and Stephanie Rugolo agree that threats from abroad to U.S. security are low and declining. However, broadening the approach to “security” used in most of this book, they come to different conclusions about threats to human security in the United States that arise from domestic concerns. Cohen argues that, particularly in comparison with other developed countries, the United States is falling behind in such human security areas as health care, infrastructure, education, and income inequality. Together, he argues, these constitute risks to “its long‐​term national security.” Rugolo disagrees. Drawing on data compiled at the website Human​Progress​.org, she documents the many ways in which the health, environmental, economic, political, food, community, and personal security for Americans is improving. She also argues that, although income inequality has increased, “real incomes have risen across every income group.” She anticipates that positive human security trends will continue, concluding that Americans are secure not only in the traditional sense but increasingly so with respect to human security. 



Four chapters consider the claim that the nation’s economy is vulnerable to harm, that the fragility of the international economic order demands a proactive approach, and that U.S. national security strategy should be oriented toward a policy of active intervention to stop possible threats before they materialize, including threats that might undermine the global economy even if they never result in open warfare. 



In this vein, Daniel Drezner considers the possible economic benefits of U.S. primacy. Some argue that U.S. security guarantees, both formal and informal, encourage other countries to defer to the U.S. government in trade negotiations or to otherwise extend preferences to U.S. businesses and consumers. Drezner finds some merit in the global public good provided by overwhelming U.S. military power. However, it is not obvious that military power is the primary driver of the benefit. Moreover, building and sustaining that power comes at great cost, and the benefits of military hegemony do not generally offset this expense. 



Eugene Gholz explores the economic effects of warfare and of preparing to fight wars. When countries shift resources to the purchase of military goods, the result is not so dissimilar from other consumption binges, and “conflict naturally transfers wealth from the tension‐​filled parts of the world to relatively peaceful, neutral parts.” Although war itself may have many highly undesirable effects, tensions and war overseas do not necessarily harm the American economy. 



Joshua Shifrinson and Sameer Lalwani examine the threats posed to the global maritime commons—loosely, the seas on which most global trade is conducted and the air above them. They scrutinize current U.S. strategy designed to deal with challenges in that area, a strategy that hinges on U.S. global hegemony or what others have called primacy, deep engagement, or dominance. They find that any threat is “significantly overstated”—in some cases nearly nonexistent—which strongly suggests that the United States is doing far more than it needs to. Moreover, American strategy encourages other countries to free‐​ride on the security guarantees provided by the U.S. military, and that imposes an unnecessary burden on U.S. taxpayers. They urge the United States to move away from attempts to dominate, or to “command,” the commons, and they suggest instead an offshore balancing strategy that shifts some of the costs of maintaining open access to the sea and air to the many countries that benefit from that access and that would be most harmed by disruptions to it. 



Brendan Green agrees that the primacy strategy is flawed at its core because it greatly exaggerates the likelihood that a challenging great power hegemon will emerge. These exaggerated fears prompt the United States to spend massively on defense and to risk war “to stop other people from fighting among themselves.” Put another way, the threats that the United States confronts today are as much caused as solved by the primacy strategy, creating alliances that probably will not “prevent conflict in the situations where it is most likely” and “are unnecessary in most other circumstances.” 



The book concludes with two chapters that consider the sources of threat inflation in the United States and what, if anything, can be done to counteract them. 



Christopher Fettweis perceives a deep pathological impulse with in the collective American psyche to exaggerate dangers. Many Americans have internalized the belief that the United States is not only an island of tranquility surrounded by a dark and dangerous world beset by continuous violence, but also an exceptional nation that is uniquely suited to bring order out of chaos and is thus indispensable to global security. Fettweis contends that, although “there is precious little evidence to suggest that the United States is responsible for the pacific trends” in the world, the “empirical realities” of those trends may eventually “trump pathological geopolitical fear.” 



Benjamin Friedman sees threat inflation as a relatively recent phenomenon that can be explained by the structure of the international system within which the United States is the dominant power and by interests that have aligned to respond to—and profit from—that condition, including defense agencies and interests, politicians, policymakers, the defense industry, nongovernmental organizations, some foreign states, the news media, think tanks, and public intellectuals. In the process, they “serially exaggerate the nation’s vulnerability to national security threats,” and “estimates of danger are more servants of policy preferences than their cause.” Those efforts are not always successful with the public, and current conditions may favor the emergence of political interests “prone to resist threat inflation.” However, for the most part, the result has been an unbroken cycle of threat inflation. 



It would probably be too much to hope that this book, by itself, could break that cycle. But the contributors to this volume try, in their own way, to do so. Although the world will never be free from dangers, we should aspire to understand them clearly. And a better understanding of what threatens and of the dangers that do and do not exist in the world might tame our tendency to overreact. 



A better assessment of threats and dangers might also affect defense spending considerations. When running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, Newt Gingrich argued, “Defense budgets shouldn’t be a matter of politics. They shouldn’t be a matter of playing games. They should be directly related to the amount of threat we have.”12 This book assesses that threat environment—problems that lurk today and on the horizon. The exercise suggests that the United States—as it works its way out of, or away from, the costly 9/​11‐​induced wars in Afghanistan and Iraq—is substantially free from threats that require a great deal of military preparedness or “balancing” behavior. It also appears to be substantially exaggerating dangers that may still lurk and thus to be overspending to confront real or imagined threats that seem to be of only very limited significance. 



A few months after Gingrich’s observation, Greg Jaffe, the _Washington Post_ Pentagon correspondent, mused, “No one is rushing to discuss the implications of a world that has grown safer.”13 This book may help provide a useful first step toward getting that overdue discussion under way.

"
"WASHINGTON  —   The White House on Thursday defended the planning and execution of a Special Operations raid in Yemen on Sunday  —   the first approved by President Trump since taking office  —   that left one American commando dead and three others injured, and most likely killed several civilians, including children. Sean M. Spicer, President Trump’s press secretary, offered an unusually detailed chronology of the mission involving members of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 against the home of a senior Qaeda collaborator. He said it started with a plan submitted by the military’s Central Command in November under the Obama administration and ended with Mr. Trump receiving updates in the White House on Saturday night as the mission unfolded eight time zones away. “This was a very, very    and executed effort,” Mr. Spicer said. Mr. Trump has justified the risky attack on the heavily guarded house, saying the commandos recovered valuable information, including laptops and cellphones, that could help thwart future terrorist attacks. Military officials said on Thursday that while that could prove to be true, analysts were only just beginning to delve into the materials. Almost everything on the mission that could go wrong did. A Yemeni tribal sheikh said the Qaeda fighters were somehow tipped off to the troops’ stealthy advance toward the village  —   perhaps by the whine of American drones that the tribal leader said were flying lower and louder than usual. The assault force, which also included elite troops from the United Arab Emirates, quickly found itself under intense fire from all sides  —   even from female combatants who unexpectedly took up weapons from assigned fighting positions  —   forcing the Americans to call in strikes from helicopter gunships and attack planes. A Pentagon spokesman, Capt. Jeff Davis, denied on Thursday that the mission had been compromised. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid, Chief Petty Officer William Owens, was returned home. It was the first military death on the new commander in chief’s watch. Mr. Spicer insisted on Thursday that the commandos had accomplished their mission, even though “it is tough to ever use the word ‘success’ when you know that somebody has lost their life. ” His explanation did not quell calls from human rights groups and at least one Democratic member of the House Armed Services Committee for an investigation into the mission and the allegations of civilian casualties. The Central Command said on Wednesday that civilian casualties were likely and that it was investigating. According to Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, the dead include the    daughter of Anwar   the   Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. Planning for the mission started months ago, Mr. Spicer said. On Nov. 7, the Central Command submitted its plan to the Pentagon for review. The Defense Department approved it on Dec. 19, and the plan was sent to Mr. Obama’s National Security Council staff. On Jan. 6, a meeting of senior Obama security aides, called the deputies committee, recommended that the plan go forward, Mr. Spicer said. Military officials have said that Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night, and the next one after the meeting would come after Mr. Obama’s term had ended. On Jan. 24, shortly after taking office, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis read the plan and sent it back to the White House with his support. On Jan. 25, Mr. Trump was briefed by his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, on the plan and on Mr. Mattis’s endorsement. Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Mattis to dinner at the White House that night, along with Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Mr. Flynn. Also attending were two of Mr. Trump’s closest advisers, Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, as well as Vice President Mike Pence and Mike Pompeo, the C. I. A. director. “The operation was laid out in great extent,” Mr. Spicer said. “The indication at that time was to go ahead. ” On Jan. 26, last Thursday, Mr. Trump formally signed the memo authorizing the action, Mr. Spicer said. Mr. Mattis and other aides updated the president on the raid throughout the night Saturday, Mr. Spicer said. Members of Mr. Obama’s national security team pushed back Thursday at Mr. Spicer’s description of how the former president had set the stage for the decision. They said the attack had not been approved by Mr. Obama, and that materials left for the Trump team emphasized considerable risks. “Not what happened,” Colin Kahl, the national security adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wrote on Twitter after Mr. Spicer’s briefing. Mr. Kahl’s colleagues said that Lisa Monaco, Mr. Obama’s homeland security adviser, told the national security staff in early January that Mr. Obama was not prepared to approve the concept for the raid. Instead, they prepared a memorandum for Mr. Trump’s team that described a variety of options, and underscored the risks."

"For hundreds of thousands of years, the distinctive candelabra shapes of Araucaria trees (Araucaria angustifolia) have defined landscapes at the southern edge of Brazil’s Atlantic Forest. Humans have never known a world without these majestic evergreens. But my new research, conducted with colleagues in Brazil and Reading, suggests that their extinction could be just a generation or two away. At a glance you might mistake Brazil’s Araucaria for its sister species, the monkey puzzle tree found in Chile and Argentina. But the two have inhabited South America as separate species for aeons, after diverging some 28m years ago. If you compressed those 28m years into 24 hours, North and South America wouldn’t become one land mass until 9.30pm. Humans wouldn’t appear until 11.45pm. These are truly ancient plants. Araucaria trees have been revered for as long as humans have lived in southern Brazil’s highlands. Their starchy, nutrient-rich nuts (known as pinhão) underpinned the diets of indigenous groups before European arrival, especially in times of scarcity. The trees also hold great cultural importance. For example, the Kaingang people’s Kikikoi funerary ritual requires Araucaria knots to keep bonfires burning, Araucaria ashes for face-painting, and a trough made of an Araucaria trunk to hold Kiki, a fermented honey drink. The Xokleng people even used to define the boundaries of a year by the coming and going of pinhão. Today, pinhão are a regional delicacy, with trade worth millions of dollars a year and an annual festival held in their name. But while Araucaria trees are now most valued for food, it was their excellent timber that led to their downfall. Brazil’s strong economic growth in the 20th century fuelled an unsustainable demand that ultimately consumed an estimated 97% of the country’s Araucarias. In our 24-hour 28m years, the species crashed from widespread to “Critically Endangered” in a third of a second. Sadly, the short-sighted culture of consumption that drove Araucaria’s dramatic decline hasn’t gone away: human-caused climate breakdown is now threatening to tip the species into extinction. Araucaria trees are adapted to relatively cool, constantly moist conditions – conditions that are disappearing as the planet heats and normal rainfall patterns become disrupted.

      Focusing on cutting emissions alone won't halt ecological decline, we must consume less – former UK chief environmental adviser


 Using data on current and predicted temperatures and rainfall, as well as high-resolution maps that include small-scale terrain features, we modelled the likely fate of Araucaria in the coming decades. We found that projected climatic changes are likely to significantly loosen Araucaria’s grip on its current strongholds in southern Brazil. Our most optimistic scenario predicts an 85% loss of the tree’s most suitable habitat by 2070, and several scenarios predicted that this habitat would vanish altogether. Though these findings are worrying, we were able to identify some potential “microrefugia” for the Araucaria – areas where the trees have at least a three-in-four chance of enduring long into the future. These are mainly found in colder spots in the landscape – places like sheltered slopes or river valleys where cool, moist air will continue to gather, even as the wider region becomes more inhospitable. Unfortunately, the legacy of past destruction means that more than a third of these areas have already been deforested, built on, or converted to agriculture and timber plantations. Only 2.5% of the remaining area is under any sort of protection – most of it in just two national parks. With the current Brazilian government’s push to loosen environmental protections in pursuit of quick economic gains, these areas may not remain safe for long. While none of our findings are good news for Brazil’s Araucaria, it isn’t necessarily doomed. There are steps that we can take to ensure its continued survival in Brazil’s southern highlands. Clearly, all of us need to combat climate change and rein in the consumption which drives it. Beyond that, actively protecting Araucaria forests from unsustainable exploitation is a top priority. This means keeping existing protected areas safe and creating new ones – especially where microrefugia are vulnerable to damage. It also means working with private landowners outside these areas. While Araucaria forests are better protected in conservation areas, traditional methods of grazing cattle or producing maté tea under the forest canopy can support livelihoods without significant damage to Araucaria populations. And for truly long-term conservation planning which looks beyond the next decades, or even the coming centuries, we could learn a lesson or two from the past. Evidence suggests that indigenous people helped Araucaria forests expand beyond their natural boundaries around 1,000 years ago, although how and to what extent isn’t yet clear. Investigating how millennia of climate change and centuries of human actions combined to shape the present-day Araucaria forests may reveal ways of helping them survive the grave challenges of the coming decades.  We are living through the most turbulent point in the long history of Brazil’s Araucaria. Our actions in the next split-second of its 24-hour life will determine whether or not future generations have the chance to treasure this ancient icon.

"As an academic scientist who researches human evolution, I was surprised to receive an email one day from Patrice Désilets, a top computer game designer responsible for the first two Assassin’s Creed games. He was working on a new game based on our early evolution in Africa, he said, and was using my book The Cradle of Humanity as one of the key reference texts. Would I like to be involved? Patrice invited my family to Montreal in early 2018 to play and comment on an early beta version. He was greatly amused that my youngest daughter is a true gamer while I always toggle the wrong way (I’m sorry but … up should mean up). But despite my dodgy controlling, I enjoyed a stunning game with a unique subject matter, and one which I believe offers some key insights into human evolution. The newly released Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey is an open world survival game where you control a group of “hominins” – our first ancestors – and explore, expand, and lock in new knowledge so your “clan” can evolve. It takes the players from 10m years ago, and the common ancestor of both chimpanzee and hominins, to 2m years ago, when you can play as an early version of Homo erectus. The aim of the game is ultimately to evolve to the point when humans began to leave Africa. My own research has shown how climate changes in Africa prompted waves of human evolution, so I was delighted to see the landscape in the game is particularly detailed. From the dense forest where our ancestors originated to the drier open plains you can almost smell Africa. The game also shows us how dangerous life would have been because everything wants to kill you – whether it is leopards, giant snakes, eagles, crocodiles, hippos, hyenas, or a poisonous plant you try to eat.  Even today, on safari or doing fieldwork, in these parts of Africa you can feel the continual threat of the environment around you. This is because humans are really weak when compared with other animals: we are not particularly fast and we have no natural weapons. Teamwork and technology are what allow us to thrive today, and the game tracks the start of our evolution from prey to the world’s apex predator.  This is where the novelty of the game comes in. For instance, it has a very cool mechanism of locking new knowledge into your synapses. All your exploring and encounters give you experiences that can be made into new skills – evolutionary changes such as tool making and team work, both essential to deal with nasty predators. But these new skills can only be locked into your clan’s “DNA” if you complete the task with a baby or an infant with you, which mimics the passing of knowledge between generations. Some early reviewers have complained it is hard to understand how to evolve. There are minimal instructions, the game is not linear, players are driven by their own curiosity, and different players will prioritise different skills and abilities. For example you can “win” the game and leave Africa without ever evolving to walk upright if you decide to prioritise other skills. But again, this is just like real life evolution, which has no direction and is driven by random events and encounters. However, there are already excellent walkthroughs available online so, to some extent, this gaming issue has been sidestepped by a unique human characteristic – teaching – and an innovation that came much more recently: language. But I really hope most players use these sparingly, as the joy of the game comes from discovering new things for yourself. One major reviewer complaint is that if your clan dies you lose everything – unlike many other computer games, there is no reboot. Patrice again put this in because it is exactly like reality. Evolution is full of dead-ends and new species which simply died out, such as the diminutive Homo nadedi in South Africa or Homo floresiensis in Indonesia, or the Neanderthals who only survive in European and Asian DNA due to briefly interbreeding with Homo sapiens as we emerged from Africa. For me, Ancestors provides a new and novel way of envisaging the past landscapes of Africa which our ancestors had to survive and thrive within. It portrays the danger of that landscape and how key attributes such as tool making and team work helped us cease to be prey and to become a feared predator that regularly took down giant mammoth after leaving Africa. It also provides a unique way of engaging a totally different audience in the excitement and intrigue of human evolution. For those of us who research early human evolution, this is an exciting moment, a game that illustrates all our research that anyone can play. I’m now looking forward to Ancestors 2, as once proto-humans have left Africa the real fun begins."
"**Puerto Rico is the easternmost and smallest of the Greater Antilles, bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and the Caribbean Basin to the south.**
Neither a state nor independent, the island has been a US territory since 1898.
Everyone born on the island is an American citizen and holds a US passport. However, residents cannot vote in US presidential elections, unless they are registered to vote in one of the 50 states.
Puerto Rican culture is a blend of Amerindian Taino, Spanish and African influences with Spanish being the island's first language.
Tourism is an important money-earner and the island attracts millions of visitors each year. But crippling public debt, poverty and high unemployment have seen many of the islanders leave for the US mainland.
**Head of State: President Donald Trump**
**Governor (outgoing): Ricardo RossellÃ³**
Ricardo RossellÃ³ was sworn in in January 2017 after winning the governor's race, promising to push for statehood as the territory faced a deep economic crisis.
He proposed several measures aimed at alleviating the crisis, including a a referendum on statehood or independence, but the subsequent vote for statehood saw only 23% of voters take part.
Mr RossellÃ³'s term in office came to an abrupt end in the summer of 2019, when he resigned in the wake of a group text message scandal involving offensive comments.
The commonwealth constitution is modelled on that of the United States, with a governor elected for a four-year term and a bicameral legislature.
Broadcasting is regulated by the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
Home-grown comedies, talk shows and Spanish-language soaps are staple fare on local TV stations. The multichannel offerings of cable TV are widely available.
News and talk and Spanish-language pop music are among the most popular radio formats.
There were 2.6 million internet users by June 2014 Internetworldstats.com).
**Some key dates in the history of Puerto Rico:**
**1493** \- Christopher Columbus claims the island for Spain on his second voyage to the Americas. Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon establishes the first settlement in 1508.
**1500s** \- Indigenous Amerindian Taino population is virtually wiped out by disease and new settlers. African slave labour is imported.
**1868** \- A popular uprising against Spanish rule is suppressed but becomes a symbol of the independence struggle.
**1898** \- Spain cedes Puerto Rico to the US at the end of the Spanish-American War.
**1900** \- US Congress establishes a civil government under the Foraker Act but maintains strict control over island affairs. Puerto Ricans are granted US citizenship in 1917 under the Jones Act.
**1940s** \- Puerto Rico gains partial self-rule with popularly elected governors.
**1952** \- Puerto Rico becomes a self-governing commonwealth of the United States. Under US administration, it experiences growth but nationalist sentiment is still present.
**1960** - **70s** \- Violent separatism - A series of bombings and killings in the 1970s and 1980s are blamed on pro-independence group, the Macheteros, or Cane Cutters.
**1998** \- Puerto Ricans back continued commonwealth status in a referendum.
**2003** \- The US government stops military training on the offshore island of Vieques after protests.
**2006** \- The expiry of a federal tax break for US corporations in place since 1976 triggers economic recession.
**2012** \- Puerto Ricans vote for US statehood for the first time in a non-binding referendum on the island's status.
**2017** \- The territory declares bankruptcy - the largest ever for a US local government. In a non-binding referendum, it votes again to become a US state although only 23% of voters take part."
"WASHINGTON  —   When President Trump told an audience of religious leaders on Thursday that he would ‘destroy’ the Johnson Amendment, he declared his intention to sign a bill that would fundamentally alter a major aspect of the   divide that has been a constant in American politics for generations. But what exactly is the Johnson Amendment? It is one of the brightest lines in the legal separation between religion and politics. Under the provision, which was made in 1954,   entities like churches and charitable organizations are unable to directly or indirectly participate in any political campaign on behalf of, or in opposition to, any candidate. Specifically, ministers are restricted from endorsing or opposing candidates from the pulpit. If they do, they risk losing their   status. Considered uncontroversial at the time, it was passed by a Republican Congress and signed into law by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a Republican. Today, however, many Republicans want to repeal it. Back when Lyndon B. Johnson was a senator from Texas, he introduced the measure as an amendment to the tax code in 1954. Like many things Johnson did, the goal was to bludgeon a political opponent, in this case a rival in a primary who had the backing of nonprofit groups that were campaigning against him by suggesting he was a communist. Though there was no church involved, according to PolitiFact, churches were covered by the bill as well. Mr. Trump promised he would work to repeal the Johnson Amendment as part of his extensive outreach efforts to religious conservatives, a group that took a long time to warm to his candidacy. Eliminating the measure has been a goal of the right. Conservatives have argued that it violates the protections of free speech and free exercise that the First Amendment extends to houses of worship. Courts have not agreed. Speaking of the implications of a repeal last year, Jerry Falwell Jr. the prominent evangelical leader and Trump supporter, said it would “create a huge revolution for conservative Christians and for free speech. ”"

From the Guardian, where I find it surprising they actually printed it:
Scientist behind the Gaia hypothesis says environment movement does not pay enough attention to facts and he was too certain in the past about rising temperatures
Environmentalism has “become a religion” and does not pay enough attention to facts, according to James Lovelock.
The 94 year-old scientist, famous for his Gaia hypothesis that Earth is a self-regulating, single organism, also said that he had been too certain about the rate of global warming in his past book, that “it’s just as silly to be a [climate] denier as it is to be a believer” and that fracking and nuclear power should power the UK, not renewable sources such as windfarms.

Speaking to the Guardian for an interview ahead of a landmark UN climate science report on Monday on the impacts of climate change, Lovelock said of the warnings of climate catastrophe in his 2006 book, Revenge of Gaia: “I was a little too certain in that book. You just can’t tell what’s going to happen.”
…
Lovelock’s comments appear to be at odds with dire forecasts from a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday, which leaked versions show will warn that even small temperature rises will bring “abrupt and irreversible changes” to natural systems, including Arctic sea ice and coral reefs.
Asked if his remarks would give ammunition to climate change sceptics, he said: “It’s just as silly to be a denier as it is to be a believer. You can’t be certain.”

Remember this before and after picture in the news recently from NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity?

Well, it appears there’s a conspiracy theory under every rock, more fodder for Lewandowsky and Cook I suppose.

Science doesn’t advance by lawsuits, though some people think  it does.
I’ll point out the obvious: that “biological organism” hasn’t moved since.
The explanation from NASA’s mission leader Steve Squires (al la Occams’ Razor):

“We think the most likely hypothesis is that it was dislodged by the rover wheels from a location that may currently be obscured by the solar arrays,” he said via email.
Squyres described the rock as “white around the outside, in the middle there’s low spot that is dark red. It looks like a jelly donut,” and said it’s like nothing they’ve ever seen before on Mars.
And Squires has a photo to back up the claim:

Anyone who’s ever driven a vehicle down a gravel road knows that rocks get dislodged by the tires and may move a foot or two.
The lawsuit seemed almost too ridiculous to be real, so I checked to see if the plaintiff was real. Yep, he has his own Wiki page.
Rhawn Joseph is a neuropsychologist who worked at the Veterans’ Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System in California.
He is involved with the Journal of Cosmology, and he advances eccentric views on the origin of life on Earth.[1]
Joseph is the author of Astrobiology: The Origins of Life and the Death of Darwinism, published in 2001. In the book he writes that “Contrary to Darwinism … the evidence now clearly indicates, that the evolution of life had been genetically predetermined and precoded…”
…
Joseph has been described by some evolutionary biologists as a crank for embracing unorthodox mechanisms of evolution. In one instance, the blogger P.Z. Myers ridiculed a claim by Joseph that a rock found on Mars is a living organism similar to a type of fungus existing on Earth.
In the lawsuit there is this language:

“Petitioner immediately recognized that bowl-shaped structure, hereafter referred to as Sol 3540, resembling a mushroom-like fungus, a composite organism consisting of colonies of lichen and cyanobacteria, and which on Earth is known as Apothecium.”
“When examined by Petitioner the same structure in miniature was clearly visible upon magnification and appears to have just germinated from spores.”

Strangely, and for the first time ever, I find myself in agreement with P.Z. Meyers.

"Nearly half of the tasks currently undertaken by humans could already be automated, even at current levels of technology. Within the next decade it is likely large sections of society will be looking for new jobs.  People are calling it the fourth industrial revolution or “industry 4.0”. The first industrial revolution used steam power to mechanise production. The second used electric power to mass produce products while the third introduced computers to automate production. The fourth revolution is happening now, disruptive technologies including the internet of things, virtual reality, robotics, and artificial intelligence are changing the way we interact, work, and live. Highly automated, intelligent systems promise to transform people’s lives and even question the very role of humans.

      Bitcoin is like a real gold rush: it's the miners who are exploited


 What will all this mean for climate change? The answer is complicated. These innovations have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide unprecedented levels of insight and data to mitigate climate change. But without proper consideration mass automation could be bad news, increasing consumption and emissions.  To consider what mass automation might mean for our environmental impact, I want to look at two sectors where human work has already been largely replaced by machinery: agriculture and cars. At the beginning of the 20th century cars were a plaything of the rich, out of the reach of the average person. But that was before Henry Ford perfected the assembly line concept, and rapidly came to dominate nearly half of the American automobile market. Before Ford, cars were an artisan product, individually built by hand by teams of skilled craftsmen. Once one car was completed the team could start work on the next. Ford reconfigured this process, with multiple stations working on specific assembly processes, with each car moving from one manufacturing process to the next in order of assembly.   The Ford Model T assembly line had 84 different stages (source: Gfycat) Today, car manufacturing is largely fully automated, with human teams replaced by robotic workers. Robots and other technologies of industry 4.0 enable more efficient energy management in factories. And better data means better managed supply chains. This has allowed manufacturers to reduce waste and emissions across the entire lifecycle of products such as cars – from the initial metals and minerals, through to the energy used to transport products to market. Much like Ford’s cars, developments in mechanisation – tractors, combine harvesters and so on – have allowed more food to be produced with less labour. Despite this, with the world population and demand for food rapidly rising, agriculture is responsible for increasing greenhouse gas emissions and an enormous share of environmental degredation. It is vital we find ways to further improve efficiency and reduce the emissions from our food production.  But, as with cars, agriculture will fundamentally change with the advent of mass automation and smart technologies. Robots are already replacing human labour across a range of agricultural tasks from watering to pest control or harvesting. Even tractors could eventually become autonomous. Fully automated, vertical farms are being built, maximising space and production efficiency. These and various other innovations and emerging technologies including off-grid renewable energy systems all promise to produce food more efficiently, reducing emissions. These developments might suggest that these tech developments will reduce emissions and help the environment. After all, robots can build cars and grow food more efficiently than humans, right?  The issue is while there has been a significant improvement in energy and resource efficiency, there has not been an absolute reduction in environmental impact. In fact, overall environmental impact is generally increasing. Some commentators even argue that improvements in technology have actually driven an increase in consumption, a phenomenon commonly referred to as the “rebound effect”.  With cars for example, the efficiency savings made by robots have meant more people can afford to buy a new vehicle, increasing the numbers on the roads and the overall emissions from our roads. Even if many of these vehicles were replaced with zero-emission electric cars, there are still emissions associated with production and disposal and electricity supply.  Similarly, automated processes and huge industrial farms have meant more food can be produced more efficiently. However, cheaper food and increasing average wealth are increasing consumption of high impact foods such as red meat, which is likely to have significant consequences for climate change and biodiversity. So, yes, increasing automation and smart technologies do promise sweeping changes to society, with the potential to liberate human populations from the mundane. If managed carefully this technological revolution has the potential to provide significant environmental benefit. But that is a big if. Automation will not necessarily deliver a positive outcome for sustainability – we need to manage our consumption, even as the latest technological revolution races ahead of us.

"Yet another seismic shift is taking place in French fashion. Riccardo Tisci, the creative director of Givenchy and the designer responsible for redefining the brand Audrey Hepburn built for the Kardashian era, said on Thursday that he was leaving the brand after 12 years. A successor has not been announced. Bernard Arnault, chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the French conglomerate that owns Givenchy, said in a statement, “The chapter Riccardo Tisci has written with the House of Givenchy represents an incredible vision to sustain its continuous success, and I would like to warmly thank him for his core contribution. ” Designer moves have become so common of late they are starting to seem more   than critical. (A brief list of departures, since 2015, include Raf Simons from Dior, Hedi Slimane from Saint Laurent, Alber Elbaz from Lanvin, Alexander Wang from Balenciaga, Consuelo Castiglioni from Marni and, as of last Monday, Clare Waight Keller from Chloé.) But Mr. Tisci’s amicable divorce from Givenchy, rumors of which WWD reported on last month, could have deeper repercussions. Mr. Tisci had, after all, not only transformed Givenchy into one of LVMH’s most successful brands, but was often held up as a model for the partnership between hot young designer and heritage house. That he was willing to end what appeared to be a happy marriage suggests that the old days of designers staying in place for decades (Karl Lagerfeld has been at Chanel since 1983) may be finally, officially, over. Linda Fargo, senior vice president for fashion and store presentation at Bergdorf Goodman, said, “I guess destabilization is the new normal. ” When Mr. Tisci joined Givenchy in 2005 the brand was floundering after being led by a quick series of creative directors, including John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Julien Macdonald. In an interview with The Financial Times in 2011, Marco Gobbetti, the former chief executive of Givenchy, said the brand was “a mess, without an identity. ” And Mr. Tisci was a    upstart Italian with a gothic sensibility who had barely started his own line. It seemed a surprising match, but Mr. Tisci managed to combine his own   sensibility with a certain French classicism and a dose of emotion to give Givenchy a newfound relevance: He made crosses, skulls and the perfect white shirt make sense. Mr. Tisci was also an early adopter of social media, cognizant of the power that those platforms and influencers would have on fashion. He has 1. 8 million followers on Instagram, and many of his famous friends appear in his posts as often as they do in the front row of his shows. LVMH, which also has brands such as Louis Vuitton, Céline and Fendi in its portfolio, does not break down the performance of individual maisons in its financial results. But the number of employees at Givenchy has more than tripled since Mr. Tisci joined the house in 2005, and sales revenue is believed to have grown to around 500 million euros ($539 million) annually. There are now 72   stores worldwide (compared with seven in 2005) with a Rome flagship set to open this year, and plans for a London store are underway for next year. Last week, LVMH, the world’s biggest luxury group, posted record revenue and profits for 2016, beating expectations because of strong sales in the United States and Europe and a pickup in demand in Asia. “Riccardo has accomplished everything a designer can do for a brand, clocking a very respectable tenure and creating a fully realized language for them,” Ms. Fargo said. So, why leave? Mr. Tisci said in his statement, “I now wish to focus on my personal interests and passions. ” But rumors have suggested he may be headed to Versace. It would mean going home to Italy, and to a brand whose unabashed Italian sex and   aesthetic mirrors his own. And Mr. Tisci is close to Donatella Versace (he shocked fashion in 2015 when he featured Ms. Versace, at least nominally a rival designer, in a Givenchy ad campaign). Besides, the suggestion, briefly beloved of the industry, that a designer needs a timeout from the increasingly endless show seasons, which was posited when both Mr. Simons and Ms. Waight Keller left their posts, increasingly seems like smoke and mirrors. After Dior, Mr. Simons took an even bigger job at Calvin Klein, and Ms. Waight Keller is said to be moving to a different brand (Givenchy? ). Perhaps this is the answer. Once upon a time, a designer’s name was on the door, and his or her heart was in building a legacy. Now it is rare that any creatives start their own line. Rather, the biggest jobs involve putting their talents at the service of someone else’s already gilded name. That may be an interesting intellectual and creative challenge for a while, but once achieved, it no longer holds the same allure, and the search for the next test begins. “This clearly shows that a lot of folks are about change and evolution, and both designers and brands want to be continually in motion,” said Marc Metrick, president of Saks Fifth Avenue. We tend to romanticize “the designers” and to bestow upon them some sort of mystical, spiritual connection to the houses where they reign, maybe because what they make touches our bodies and can thus transform our lives, maybe because it involves the alchemy of invention or because designers these days have the golden glow of celebrity. But what Mr. Tisci’s move suggests  —   what all of this may reveal  —   is another, more parochial, truth: Being a designer is a job like any other. And people change jobs.   Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, suggested when Frida Giannini was ousted from Gucci in 2014 that 10 years was probably long enough for any designer to stay at a brand, and after that it was good to mix things up (10 years also being the number most often chosen as an ideal tenure for a chief executive). At the time, it seemed like a radical idea. It does not any more."

"**An American woman lured to Nigeria by a promise of marriage from a man she met on Facebook has been rescued after being held captive for more than a year, police say.**
The 46-year-old was held against her will in a hotel room in Lagos.
The suspect Chukwuebuka Obiaku, 34, ""took control"" of the unnamed victim's credit and debit cards, and retirement benefits, according to the police.
Over a period of 15 months she was forced to part with $48,000 (Â£38,000).
The victim is a retired civil servant from Washington DC.
Police say Mr Obiaku ""also used the victim as a front to defraud her associates and other foreign personalities and companies"".
The victim arrived from the US in February 2019, according to Nigerian police. In May 2019 she married Mr Obiaku.
In total, the woman is said to have been held against her will for 16 months in a hotel room.
The police say they received a tip off from a ""civic minded"" individual and they used the information to rescue her.
Mr Obiaku has been arrested and police say he faces a charge of cybercrime.
Known as ""Yahoo boys"", Nigerian online fraudsters have become notorious for defrauding people of millions of dollars.
Last month, police say they rescued a Filipina woman who came to Nigeria in search of romance after meeting a man on Facebook. She was held for six months against her will.
The recent high-profile arrests of two Nigerian social media stars accused of large-scale fraud ended with them being taken to the US where they now await trial.
Nigerian police have also announced three further arrests of alleged cyber fraud criminals with links to Italy and Turkey, suspected of the fraudulent supply of Covid-19 face masks.
Police allege they made more than $400,000 from online fraud."
"China has invested US$90 billion in the countries involved in its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since 2013. The BRI involves developing infrastructure in 126 partner countries to boost trade within a region stretching from Indonesia to Western Europe via the Middle East and East Africa, inspired by the historical Silk Road. While this economic development could help raise living standards in participating countries, it could also come with a huge potential increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. But our research demonstrates the region has huge potential for generating solar power. This could decouple economic growth from increasing carbon emissions.  Currently, over 55% of global GHG emissions come from the entire BRI region, and this number is expected to rise to above 65% by 2030 if their growth rates of emissions remain at current levels. Four countries in particular – China, India, Iran and Saudi Arabia – are among the top ten CO₂ emitters in the world and were responsible for 39.4% of the global emissions in 2017. Those emissions are likely to rise unless substantial efforts are made. Yet the region also has huge potential to reduce emissions and become a major source of solar energy. Little research has been done specifically on the BRI region. So we evaluated the potential for solar electricity across 66 adjoining countries within the main BRI region, considering all the factors that might impact output. Our study suggests solar generation in the BRI region could provide a total of 448.9 petawatt hours of electricity annually, which is the equivalent of 41.3 times the area’s total 2016 electricity demand. Just 3.7% of this would provide enough annual electricity to power the entire region in 2030 based on projected demand, requiring land equivalent to approximately 0.9% of China’s total area. The four top emitters have an estimated solar potential of up to 238.2 petawatt hours, representing 53.1% of the total for the BRI region we studied. If these countries could use solar power to generate just 30% of their electricity demand, it could save approximately 2.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to a reduction in global carbon emissions of 7.2%. We also found that 63 out of the 66 countries consume a total of just 30.1% of the region’s electricity, but together could produce as much as 70.7% of its solar power. However, this highlights one of the challenges with any plans to make the most of solar power in the BRI region. Countries need to cooperate over technology or even link their electricity grids together in order to share their green power. For many countries in the BRI, energy interconnection can be achieved by upgrading and expanding existing local interconnected grids within each individual country rather than by creating new infrastructure. This may make interconnection easier, cheaper and have less environmental impact. For example, countries such as Kazakhstan could upgrade the Soviet-era Central Asian Unified Power System designed to share hydro power between countries in the region. Because solar power is intermittent, countries need to build their solar infrastructure to supply electricity created in times and places where the sun shines most, to when and where it is most needed. For example, connecting rural areas to more highly populated urban areas, which could be done across country borders to maximise the outputs. There are also barriers to introducing a massive solar generating programme in the first place. Although solar energy has become a lot cheaper in recent years, the cost of building, operating and maintaining large amounts of solar infrastructure could still be prohibitive for many of the lower income countries in the BRI region, and the industry might need subsidies to make it happen. The relatively poor condition of the electricity grids in many of these countries will also make it harder to integrate a variable source of energy such as solar power. This is due to the lack of modern technologies within some of these countries, especially in regions with a poor electricity network.  These challenges mean that governments and industry need to work together effectively and cooperate across borders in order to reduce the risks of investing heavily in solar. If they get it right, these countries could jump from their carbon-intensive trajectories to a low-carbon future."

Share this...FacebookTwitterTony Thomas at the Australian online Quadrant site here has an excellent overview of who and what is really behind the far-out alarmist “science” coming from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK): “Die Grünshirts Parachute Into Parkville“.
Some excerpts follow.
On Hans Schellnhuber:
PIK was founded in 1991 by climate doomsday professor, Herr Professor-Doktor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, who continues to lead it and seek for it world-changing powers. In an interview with Der Spiegel in 2011, Schellnhuber was asked: ‘Do you feel that the government’s abrupt change of course in relation to its energy policy is adequate?’ He replied (emphasis added):
‘No. It can only be the beginning of a deep-seated shift. The German Advisory Council on Global Change, which I chair, will soon unveil a  plan for a transformation of society. Precisely because of Fukushima, we believe that a new basis of our coexistence is needed.’ “
On Otmar Edenhofer:
One of his master plans for renewable energy involved, he said, a cost of ‘a mere twelve thousand billion dollars by 2030′ to put the world onto 75% renewable energy by 2050.

Someone’s calculated that USD12 trillion is about eight times the cost of World War 11. And Edenhofer doesn’t even mention the costs from 2030-50, or the untold billions spent already to deliver 0.3% renewable energy to the globe so far. Could Edenhofer have   triple-digit trillions in mind?”
On Stefan Rahmstorf:
In 2011 he was found by a German court to have made ‘untruthful assertions’ against a journalist, Irene Meischner, who had dared to criticize blunders in the IPCC (she was not even a sceptic).  He wrote on his blog that she had been dishonest, sloppy, had never read the IPCC report, and  had even plagiarized writings. Meischner stood up,  sued and won.”
On Dr Leena Srivastava:
…is Acting Director-General of the TERI think-tank, until February run by IPCC chair (now ex-chair) Rajendra Pachauri. The New Delhi police, who are taking a  keen interest in the disgraced warmist, allege that the 74-year-old spent much of his final 15 months at TERI stalking a 29-year-old female staffer.

Incredibly even the Vatican has hitched its wagon to these individuals and their movement. The Church truly has been corrupted.

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s official. Germany’s Irsching power plant in Bavaria will be shutting down its recently built Block 4 and 5 gas-fired turbines. Both combined put out approximately 1.4 gigawatts of power. Online Spiegel here reports that its operators say it is no longer worth operating due to Germany’s Energiewende (transition to renewable energy).
The sporadic supply of solar and wind power into the grid means that the gas-turbines run only part-time, and often within a range that is inefficient. Two weeks ago I reported on this here. Now it’s official.
The Irsching Blocks 4 & 5 are the ultimate in gas-turbine engineering – reaching an efficiency of 60.75%. But its operators, among them energy giant E.on, announced that they are shutting down the turbines effective April 1, 2016. Spiegel writes the reason is “the lack of opportunity for economical operation“.
E.on and the other partner operators will need to obtain the shut-down approval from the Germany regulatory authorities.
Energiewende has thrown the energy market in turmoil
Spiegel adds:

Gas-fired power plants are currently under massive pressure due to the Energiewende and the plunge of power prices on the trading markets. ‘The growing amounts of subsidized power from renewable energies and the low wholesale prices for electricity no longer allow operation on the market,’ the four [Irsching] operators declared.”
Spiegel writes that the legal and political situation is also set to potentially become really messy. Already as “ultima ratio”, legal action is being threatened should German regulatory officials turn down E.on’s and its partner operators’ request to shut down the plant, something that German Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the authorities would not allow to happen as the German power grid has become too precarious.
Supply problems are set to become far more critical as Germany will be forced by law to shut down its remaining nuclear power plants by 2022. Currently the German state of Bavaria is also blocking the construction of two major power transmission lines which would deliver power from large-scale wind parks in the North and Baltic seas.
With power transmission lines blocked, nuclear power slated to be decommissioned and gas power plants being shut down, the south German states are rapidly being maneuvered into a position where they will soon be confronted by huge power supply bottlenecks. Large power consumers are becoming wary.
Spiegel writes that E.on’s Irsching shut-down announcement jacks up the pressure on politicians.
Unless all the green madness ends quickly, soon there may be no more lights left to switch off in Bavaria on “Earth Day'”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday approximately 15,000 coal miners turned out to protest the German government’s energy policy.
German Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel announced earlier he intended to levy a CO2 surcharge on older coal power plants with the aim of shutting them down.

Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke. Photo EIKE.
Before yesterday’s demonstration, German physicist and climate scientist and spokesman for the European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), Prof. Dr. Horst-Joachim Lüdecke, published a sharply-worded commentary here on the government’s anti-fossil fuel/nuclear power policy. As the introduction Lüdecke wrote:
Climate protection and the switch over to renewable energies were instilled in German citizens by state propaganda, green brainwashing and with the help of all of Germany’s mainstream media. The unconditional necessity to advance into alternative energies has become a religious creed. By historical and global comparison, such a thing happens the most easily here, time after time. The logic used by the politically interested parties every time appears to be infallible. [..]
The argument goes as follows: The rescue of the planet from a death by heat and the immediate shutdown of the irresponsible German nuclear power plants are essential. The question of whether this is really true is not be asked, let alone discussed.”
Lüdecke says, however, that public awareness over the madness of Germany’s energy policy is beginning to dawn and that he believes “now is the phase of sobering up, but unfortunately not yet one of reason.” Leading print media are beginning to soften their support for the so-called Energiewende as it now stands, he writes. As angry coal miners take to the street, and thousands of industrial jobs become threatened, it is becoming increasingly apparent something has gone awry.

Lüdecke thinks that the sobering-up process will take time because every political party has made green issues part of its platform. “Green is a very difficult color to wash away,” the German physicist writes.
Lüdecke then explains the primary disadvantage of renewable energy: their low energy density, i.e. meaning they require vast areas and that the major ones are weather-dependent. The German EIKE professor does not know how long the sobering-up process will take, citing the immense power of an array of lobbies behind the green movement.
Lüdecke also aims harsh words at Germany’s pompous and one-sided media:
Finally a word for the German media, here especially for the public TV and radio networks. They are rightly being compared by the current contemporaries to the conditions of former East Germany or even earlier times.”
At the political level, Lüdecke blasts the atmosphere of intimidation against people who have alternative views, who often are threatened with physical violence from radical leftists groups.
When it comes to openness, such as that proclaimed by French philosopher Voltaire, the German climatologist writes “in the dark media of Germany, we are miles away.”  He adds:
Factual discourse, connected with polite listening and taking the arguments from opponents seriously, is definitely not in fashion.”
Lüdecke describes Germany as a desert when it comes to independent reporting and expression of opinions.

"Few things engage a particular subset of conservative media more than an environmentalist having an apparent change of heart and dumping all over the “climate scare”. Earlier this week, the Australian newspaper ran an opinion piece that fitted this narrative so perfectly that room was found on its front page.  The American environment and energy commentator and nuclear power supporter Michael Shellenberger was the provider. “On behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologise for the climate scare we created over the past 30 years,” wrote Shellenberger in his 1,700-word article. A long interview on Australia’s Sky television, known for airing derisory views of environmentalism and climate change in its evening schedules, soon followed. Though he had almost no profile in Australia before the piece, Shellenberger has been a contrarian voice on environmental issues and a critic of aspects of environmentalism for more than 15 years. But his “apology for the climate scare” has unsettled some supporters of his who spoke to Guardian Australia. His op-ed was first published three days earlier on Forbes, but was removed by the outlet. Shellenberger claimed on social media he had been censored and told rightwing site the Daily Wire he was grateful Forbes was committed to publishing viewpoints that “challenge the conventional wisdom, and thus was disappointed my editors removed my piece from the web”. Forbes told Guardian Australia the article was removed “because it violated our editorial guidelines around self-promotion”. Before appearing in the Australian, the op-ed also ran on the website of Shellenberger’s thinktank, Environmental Progress, and on at least three other sites. The article heavily promoted Shellenberger’s new book, Apocalypse Never. The article contained a list of “facts few people know” to buttress his claim that while climate change was happening, “it’s not even our most serious environmental problem”. Among Shellenberger’s many claims was that climate change was not making natural disasters worse, fires had declined around the world since 2003, and the more dangerous fires being experienced in Australia and California were because of the build up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change. Voices that have questioned human-caused climate change have embraced and applauded Shellenberger’s article. At the same time, climate science experts have also offered qualified praise, while expressing concerns about the broader impact of the opinion article. Respected MIT climate expert Prof Kerry Emanuel sits on a line-up of science advisers of Environmental Progress. He told Guardian Australia he was “very concerned” about the opinion piece, and was consulting with other members of the advisory group before deciding whether to remain listed. Emanuel said he joined the thinktank some years ago “as it was then a voice for a rational approach to dealing with climate change, emphasising the need for nuclear power as part of the solution – a point I still very much agree with”. But commenting on the opinion piece, he said: “In the first place, no one has the right to speak for the entirety of the environmental movement.” He said Shellenberger was right to call out extreme statements from some environmentalists, but added: “Elsewhere, he gets a few of his facts wrong.” He said: “For example, he states ‘climate change is not making natural disasters worse’ when there is plenty of evidence that it is.” The environmental movement, Emanuel said, had “consistently and destructively overemphasised the risks and costs of nuclear power” while pushing “the fantasy of 100% renewables, overlooking the bad environmental outcomes of those energy sources”. But he said there was nothing to be gained “by embracing disinformation on the other side”. One example of the more questionable claims in the opinion piece comes when Shellenberger claims fires in Australia and California were becoming more dangerous because of the “build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change”. That claim is at odds with many studies showing higher temperatures driven by rising levels of greenhouse have already increased the risks of bushfires in Australia and will continue to do so in the future. A review of the academic literature produced earlier this year in response to Australia’s devastating bushfire summer found “human-induced warming has already led to a global increase in the frequency and severity of fire weather, increasing the risks of wildfire”. Shellenberger came to prominence in 2004 when he co-authored an essay criticising mainstream environmentalism. He wrote: “We will never be able to turn things around as long as we understand our failures as essentially tactical, and make proposals that are essentially technical.” Veteran climate scientist Prof Tom Wigley, of the University of Adelaide, was asked by Shellenberger to read his book and gave it a glowing review. He told Guardian Australia he thought the book “may well be the most important book on the environment ever written”. But he said the way the opinion piece had framed the issue of climate change would put Shellenberger in a difficult position. “I think that Michael has gone a little too far and he will have to defend this article for many years and, in the meantime, some damage will be done as his words may be misrepresented by people who don’t believe in human-caused global warming,” Wigley said. Ben Heard, founder of Australian environmental group Bright New World, which also advocates for nuclear energy, has known Shellenberger for a decade. “That’s not the article I would write,” he told Guardian Australia. “Michael is getting a number of extremely important truths out there, although they may have been expressed only partially and that can be a problem. “If the objective is to draw more attention to other impacts [on the environment] then that’s good and important, but that doesn’t need to be done at the expense of urgent action to reduce emissions – and I don’t think Michael thinks that either. “I can’t speak for his motivations in writing this piece but I can say he does care about the natural world and the human beings that live in it. “Whether or not climate change is the most urgent environmental problem is Michael’s answer to an unhelpful question.” According to the latest publicly available financial records, Environmental Progress earned US$809,000 in revenue in 2017 from gifts, grants and donations. In the process of researching this article, Guardian Australia emailed questions to Shellenberger to clarify why Forbes had removed his article and who funded his organisation. A third question related to a 2017 internal report from the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) which said the institute, which represents the nuclear energy industry, had “engaged third parties to engage with media through interviews and op-eds” and named “environmentalist Michael Shellenberger” as one of those it had engaged. Ninety minutes after the deadline to respond to the questions had passed, Shellenberger emailed a letter to Guardian Australia entitled “Formal request for ethics investigation of Graham Redfearn [sic]” and then shared the letter on social media. A spokesperson for NEI said: “Our engagement with third parties that you referenced means to keep in contact with people and organisations who have an interest in nuclear energy and sharing materials of common interest. No payments have been provided to Mr. Shellenberger. NEI has been a participant and registrant to annual meetings that Environmental Progress hosted in 2018 and 2019.” In his letter to Guardian Australia, Shellenberger wrote: “We accept donations solely from individuals and organizations with no financial interest in our work and publish the names of our donors on our website.” According to the website of Environmental Progress, the thinktank takes “no contributions from energy companies or energy interests”, and then lists a series of individuals and foundations who were donors. In follow-up questions, Guardian Australia asked Shellenberger to comment on the criticisms of his opinion piece by some of his supporters, but received no response."

Can Pauline and Bob win Queensland in 2020?



Ok, I know I am dreaming, as Darryl Kerrigan would have said, but wouldn’t it be fantastic if Queensland went True Blue, Dinkie Die, proper old fashioned and the pair of Outsiders won the election and we got our State back? If it happened, it would be going straight to the pool room.



Anyone who remembers that iconic movie from the 80’s The Castle will remember old mate Darryl fighting for the right to stay in his home.



To me, a stead fast and true imported Queenslander from 1978, I have loved my State since I arrived and, of late, have felt like a stranger here. The days of the prawn of the barbie ( cruel ) , cricket on Whitehaven Beach when a certain young lady clean bowled Allan Border because her bikini top fell down (sexist) ; when [Sir Joh](https://www.patriotrealm.com/index.php/161-a-benevolent-dictatorship-and-chooks) outlawed gambling and pornography ( dictator ) ; when Lady Flo ended a miners strike with a thermos flask of tea and a batch of pumpkin scones ( bribery ) ; when corruption was what we today would see as not even worth mentioning = the good old days.



Why do I feel this way? Because, back then, we were ruled by a Law that has disappeared from our lives.



 **“ Federal Court Judge: And what Law are you basing this argument on?**



 **Darryl Kerrigan: The Law of bloody common sense! “**



Ahh, yes, the good old days.



We are now ruled by a group of women who feel that they know what we want and that we are somehow incapable of making up our own minds as to what is important in our lives.



 **Apparently, mining is bad. Coal is bad. Farming is bad.**



It is far more important to munch an avocado and let our livestock starve, our bush towns die and our export earnings plummet, our towns get threatened by out of control bushfires due to lack of firebreaks, our tourists leave for fear of getting eaten by a shark, our State perish… far more important to make sure that the leftie luvvies in Brisbane feel good about climate catastrophe than worry about our State.



 **Surely that defies Darryl’s Law of Common sense?**



But no, Ms Trad and Ms Pluck a duck feel that a potentially endangered species of ground slug is more important than the Queenslanders who pay their bloody wages.



I don’t know about you, but I have had a gutful. I am, [as Redhead said, FED Up](https://www.patriotrealm.com/index.php/256-redhead-is-fed-up).



 **In terms of our State elections next year, I personally feel that we need to start campaigning NOW.**



 **I want ON and Katter to form Government. Because they give a damn about us, our State and our fellow Queenslanders.**



Let us hope that the Katter Party and One Nation start early and start to field good quality candidates in EVERY seat outside of the Brisbane soy boy avo munching mumbo jumbo seats and we



 **TAKE BACK OUR STATE.**



We are proud Queenslanders.



Feather Douglas [lived in the bush and spent time in a place that few have ever visited.](https://www.patriotrealm.com/index.php/131-the-great-divide-a-mountain-range-and-a-barrier-too-high)



I have met people that have endured yet thrived because of their enormous Queensland Spirit. In a place where city dwellers would perish should they ever have to spend a week there, let alone a lifetime.



It is time for us to take our State back and, as Darryl Kerrigan said, so very well, all those decades ago

Attorney arguing his case
Guest essay by Roger E. Sowell, Esq. reposted with permission from Sowell’s Law Blog
In the past month, several articles appeared calling for the jailing of those who provide financial support for research into climate science with an objective of proving that man-made climate change does not exist.  An overview is provided at WattsUpWithThat (see link).  Responses to the call for jailing are numerous.
The background on this is that three sides exist in the climate change argument: one, the warmists, those who fervently believe that man’s activities by
burning fossil fuels will drive up the Earth’s temperature and cause all manner of horrible happenings; two, the skeptics, those who understand that the science simply does not support the warmists’ view, that any increase in global temperature is related to natural cycles but not to man’s fossil fuel consumption; and three, lukewarmers, those whose views fall in between the warmists and the skeptics.   Disclosure: my own view after long and careful study and based on engineering, science, and mathematics, is that of a confirmed skeptic with a full understanding that carbon dioxide, CO2, does indeed absorb and emit thermal radiant energy.

My previous articles on SLB outline my views.  (see My Journey, Warmists are Wrong, Chemical Engineer Takes on Warming, Cold Winters, Climate Science is Not Settled, and others). The leading climate scientists whose views most close approximate my own include Dr. S. Fred Singer of University of Virginia, and Dr. Richard Lindzen of MIT, who stated that “The claims that the earth has been warming, that there is a greenhouse effect, and that man’s activities have contributed to warming, are trivially true and essentially meaningless in terms of alarm.”
The basis for the jailing of skeptics is that many, perhaps millions, of human deaths will occur inevitably if drastic action is not taken immediately to prevent additional fossil fuel use.  By fossil fuel use, what is meant is the burning of coal and natural gas in power plants and process plants, plus burning petroleum products as transportation and heating fuel.   The supposed legal theory is that a person can be found criminally negligent if his (or her) actions cause serious harm or death to another.  In this particular case, the assertion is that those who promote research into climate change to show that no alarm is justified will cause the death of millions of people due to events such as ice caps melting, subsequent sealevel rise and coastal inundation, droughts, and heat waves.   It is criminal negligence, they assert, to try to prevent the alarm from being sounded when the consequences are so dire.
With that as background, it is necessary to examine the legal requirements of a criminal negligence case.   There are two possible crimes, first is Involuntary Manslaughter with criminal negligence as an element, the second is Voluntary Manslaughter.   Under existing California law, the following must be proven.
Involuntary Manslaughter
To prove that the defendant is guilty of Involuntary Manslaughter, the State must prove that:
1. The defendant committed a lawful act in an unlawful manner;
2. The defendant committed the act with criminal negligence; and
3. The defendant’s acts caused the death of another person.
Criminal negligence involves more than ordinary carelessness, inattention, or mistake in judgment. A person acts with criminal negligence when:
1. He or she acts in a reckless way that creates a high risk of death or great bodily injury; and
2. A reasonable person would have known that acting in that way would create such a risk.
In other words, a person acts with criminal negligence when the way he or she acts is so different from the way an ordinarily careful person would act in the same situation that his or her act amounts to disregard for human life or indifference to the consequences of that act.
With the legal rules for Involuntary Manslaughter set forth, it is possible to examine the claim that it is criminal negligence to support research into climate change to show no reason for alarm exists.
First, was there a lawful act?  The answer must be yes, conducting research into climate change is lawful.
Next, was the research done in an unlawful manner, meaning with criminal negligence?  To prove criminal negligence, two things must be proven: the acts were performed in a reckless way that creates a high risk of death or great bodily injury; and those acts caused the death of another person.
The act of conducting climate research from a skeptic view might be held to be performed recklessly and to create a risk of death or great bodily injury, but only if the research chose only data that confirmed the pre-conceived conclusion, or improper analyses were performed, or unwarranted conclusions were drawn from the data and analysis, or some combination of all the above.   It is notable that the peer-review process exists to eliminate, or at least minimize, such research techniques because they lead to bad science and poor policy decisions when those policy decisions are informed by the bad science.  The trial attorneys would identify and present evidence to show what the skeptic climate research used as data, the analysis techniques, and the conclusions.  It seems more likely that the skeptics have an excellent claim to performing good science, with the many hundreds of peer-reviewed publications that support the claim of no alarm is justified.   Indeed, the NIPCC reports show exactly such skeptical publications.
Third and finally, the research must have caused the death of another person, but in this case, as discussed below in Voluntary Manslaughter, linking any human deaths to research into climate change is extremely unlikely.  Even though the concentration of carbon dioxide continues to increase in the atmosphere, severe weather events are declining in number and intensity.
The crime of Involuntary Manslaughter, by criminal negligence, would very likely not be provable beyond a reasonable doubt.  First, there are no deaths that can be causally linked to such research, and second, the research has not been conducted in a reckless manner designed to create a risk of serious bodily harm or death.
Voluntary Manslaughter
In California, Voluntary Manslaughter has the following elements that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, for a conviction to be had.
1. The defendant intentionally committed an act that caused the death of another person;
2. The natural consequences of the act were dangerous to human life;
3. At the time he acted, he knew the act was dangerous to human life; and
4. He deliberately acted with conscious disregard for human life.
Causation 
In California, an act or omission causes injury or death if the injury or death is the direct, natural, and probable consequence of the act or omission, and the injury or death would not have happened without the act or omission.  A natural and probable consequence is one that a reasonable person would know is likely to happen if nothing unusual intervenes.   In deciding whether a consequence is natural and probable, the jury is to consider all the circumstances established by the evidence.   There may be more than one cause of injury or death.   An act or omission causes injury or death only if it is a substantial factor in causing the injury or death.   A substantial factor is more than a trivial or remote factor.  However, it does not have to be the only factor that causes the injury or death.
See: California Pen. Code § 192(a); People v. Rios (2000) 23 Cal.4th 450, 463, 469 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 512, 2 P.3d 1066].
With the legal rules above set forth, it is possible to examine the claim that it is criminal negligence to support research into climate change to show no reason for alarm exists.
First, did defendant, who supported climate research to show no reason for alarm exists, intentionally commit an act that caused injury or death to another person?
It must be determined if there were any deaths.  If no deaths exist, then there is no need to examine any of the additional elements.  At this writing, first quarter of 2014, there appear to be no human deaths that are attributable to man-made climate change.   However, a World Health Organization study from 2009 concluded that 140,000 human deaths per year are attributable to increased warming since the 1970s.  The events that caused the deaths are rather vague, but it appears the WHO claims events such as floods, severe storms, and a 2003 heat wave in Europe. Yet, the same organization admits that measuring the health effects of climate change can only be very approximate.   WHO also states that there are benefits to human life from warming, as fewer deaths occur that can be attributed to cold weather. see link
Allowing for the WHO estimate to be true, that is, 140,000 deaths occurred each year from various weather events, the question to be answered is then, is there a causal link between the severe weather events and the almost trivial increase in global temperatures?   A jury would be presented with expert testimony on the subject, most likely that no credible scientist holds the view that there is any link between the trivial amount of warming and weather events.  In fact, almost every form of weather event can be shown to be either decreasing, such as tropical storms or hurricanes, or to be no worse today than those that occurred in the past.  Droughts, floods, heat waves, all have been much worse in the past compared to today.
From the definition of Causation above, “an act or omission causes injury or death if the injury or death is the direct, natural, and probable consequence of the act or omission, and the injury or death would not have happened without the act or omission.”
Two questions then must be asked, first, were the 140,000 weather-related deaths the direct, natural, and probable consequence of research into climate change to show that no cause for alarm exists?  And, second, would the 140,000 weather-related deaths have happened without research into climate change to show that no cause for alarm exists?
To answer the first question, on deaths being the direct, natural, and probable consequence of climate research, it must be established whether those who died did so because they had no idea that the weather events would be more severe, more intense, and more deadly.  If the only word issuing from the climate researchers was that there is no cause for alarm, that proposition might be true.  However, the alarmists from above have for many years clogged the media, the airways, and the internet blogs, with dire predictions of doom.   The fact is, and this would be introduced in a trial, that warmists claim almost a consensus exists that global warming is not only real, but man’s fossil fuel consumption is the cause.  That alleged consensus is found in print, in broadcasts, and electronically on the internet.  It is unlikely that a jury would concluded that any weather-related deaths were the result of skeptical climate research.   The fact that, for example, hurricanes have decreased in intensity and number over the past 40 years is not debatable, it is a fact.  Similarly for tornadoes, droughts, and heat waves.  see link and “Global Hurricane Frequency”
From the causation definition, the jury is to consider all the circumstances established by the evidence.   This means that the conclusions by the leading warmists, the IPCC, must be considered.  The IPCC admits that there is no conclusive evidence to link severe weather events with global warming.  Indeed, it would be hard to conclude otherwise, with the hard evidence that hurricanes are less frequent and less intense, and all the other severe weather simply not matching known events from earlier years.  The key evidence on this is the warmists’ admission that events that occurred before 1970 were not related at all to man’s fossil fuel consumption; instead, they were entirely of natural causes.  Thus, all heat waves such as the long and strong heat wave of the 1930s, all droughts including the severe drought of the 1950s, and the many strong hurricanes pre-1970 all were natural occurrences.
It must be concluded, then, that element 1 from above is not true; it cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Even if defendant intentionally performed skeptical climate science research, that research could not have caused the death of another person.
In a criminal trial, the accused is acquitted if any element is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, the defense attorney cannot know which, if any, of the elements will be found not proven to that standard, so he continues on to the other elements.  One never knows what a jury will decide until the verdict is read.
Moving then to the second element, the State must prove that the natural consequences of the act were dangerous to human life.  As above, the act is skeptical climate research.    What are the natural consequences of skeptical climate research?  As time has shown, skeptical climate research has produced many hundreds of peer-reviewed and published scholarly papers that show there is no cause for alarm due to man’s fossil fuel consumption.   Also, since there is no causal link between such research and human deaths, there can be no danger to human life.  The element, too, must fail in the State’s case.  (see link)  (and this link to hundreds of peer-reviewed skeptical papers)
The third element of Voluntary Manslaughter is: at the time he acted, he knew the act was dangerous to human life.  Again, the act is performing skeptical climate research.  The jury would be told that the results of the skeptical climate research is that there is no danger.  The reasons for that conclusion would be explained in great detail, with large and colorful graphs and visual displays to emphasize each point.  The defendant, who performed the skeptical climate research, would know quite the opposite: he would know that there was no danger to human life.  Element three then would also fail in the State’s case.
Finally, the fourth element is: he deliberately acted with conscious disregard for human life.  On this point, the State must prove that defendant performed his skeptical climate research knowing that human life would be at stake, and consciously disregarded that threat to life.  Quite the contrary exists, however.  Skeptical research has shown that there is no cause for alarm, for the reasons outlined above.
The inevitable conclusion, then, would be a verdict of Not Guilty on a charge of voluntary manslaughter for those who perform skeptical climate research.  Each of the four required elements is found in the negative, that is, the State cannot prove the element exists beyond a reasonable doubt.
It is interesting, however, that those who seek an arrest and conviction for criminal negligence, or voluntary manslaughter, want the crime to be charged before the victims are dead.  The usual cry from the alarmists uses the future tense, as polar ice caps WILL melt, and sea levels WILL rise.  Or, more often, the conditional form is used, saying sea levels COULD rise by 20 feet in 100 years.
There are some crimes where a conviction may be obtained without a death, such as attempted murder, but there is no crime in California of conspiracy to commit murder ( People v. Iniguez (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 75).  There is also a crime of attempted voluntary manslaughter, but it requires the fact of heat of passion that does not arise in the climate research context (People v. Van Ronk (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 818).
Conclusion:
The facts related to the conduct of climate research that results in a conclusion of no alarm is warranted do not yield a conviction on a charge of voluntary manslaughter, or criminal negligence as described above.   The facts show that, even if some people have died from violent weather events, those weather events are in no way connected with man-made global warming that results from the consumption of fossil fuels.  The clear evidence shows that hundreds of peer-reviewed scholarly papers have been published that show there is no reason for concern, indeed, the leading body of warmist scientists also conclude there is no link between global warming and severe weather.   For a criminal conviction, each element of a crime must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  Here, each element of the charge would be shown to be discredited, not proven at all.   The exception is that a lawful act, climate research, was committed, however, that act was performed in a lawful manner.
The above is written to provide an overview of a general area of the law, and is not intended, nor is it to be relied on, as legal advice for a particular set of facts.  Specific legal advice is available from Mr. Sowell and anyone who seeks such advice is encouraged to contact Mr. Sowell.

"Floods are now an annual nightmare in many parts of southern and western India. Valleys in the states of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala that weren’t considered flood-prone until recently are at risk.  During floods and landslides in August 2019, two villages were completely destroyed killing several people, while a year earlier Kerala saw its worst floods in a century. These floods appear to be getting more severe. Climate change is causing stronger and more erratic rainfall with recurrent floods in low-lying areas while population growth is putting more people in risky areas. And another problem comes from deforestation in the mountain range where much of the water first fell: the Western Ghats.  The Western Ghats run for 1,600km in parallel with India’s west coast, from Gujarat right down to Tamil Nadu at the tip of the subcontinent. It is – or was – a picturesque landscape of serene valleys, steep gorges and virgin forests. Yet recurring floods and landslides in the mountains, hills and areas downstream (between the Ghats and the sea) show that India must rethink its environmental law to balance the needs of nature and humans.  The mountains are teeming with life. Though they cover only a small part of India’s total land area, the Ghats are home to more than 30% of the country’s species of plants, fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, including both wild elephants and tigers. Its combination of unique species and habitat loss means Unesco has recognised it as one of eight global “hottest hotspots” of biodiversity.  Climate change is already having an obvious impact, with unprecedented rains in monsoon seasons and severe drought and dry rivers in summer. And as the human population has grown, people have chopped down the forests and replaced them with spice, tea, coffee and rubber plantations. Thousands of illegal stone quarries now also operate in the Ghats, where mountainsides are demolished to generate stones and sand for the construction industry. Deforestation and the use of highly destructive explosives mean these areas are prone to increased seismic tremors and landslides.   Large dams on major rivers offer renewable energy yet also raise another set of environmental problems. In Kerala, many are located in eco-sensitive parts of the Western Ghats, with some dating back to British rule. As demand for energy increases, India plans to build more dams which in turn could lead to massive deforestation and ecosystem destruction. All this makes flooding more severe, as deforestation in the catchment area of a river reduces the land’s ability to retain water.  Whether triggered by damming, deforestation, or exacerbated by climate change, human-induced natural disasters in the region have pointed to a need for stronger environmental protection laws. India’s 1950 constitution claims that protection of environment is a fundamental duty of every citizen, and though it does not explicitly contain a right to a clean environment, legal authority for environmental lawmaking is derived from the document.   Over the years, the country’s central government has enacted various laws that are applicable to the Western Ghats: the Environment Protection Act 1986, the Forest Conservation Act 1980, the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2002 and so on. However, these laws are not implemented efficiently, which makes me wonder if areas like the Himalayas and the Western Ghats – internationally significant ecosystems and biosphere reserves – need their own special laws. Additionally, India’s water laws are inadequate. Existing legislation primarily focuses on pollution control, meaning the law has little to say about preventing or even managing floods which result from mismanagement of dams or too much riverside development. The problem is enhanced in case of rivers that flow across state boundaries. Some of the major floods in the past couple years happened after dams at or near full capacity in one district or state were opened, letting water flow downstream into another area. Recently, a draft dam safety bill has been proposed to address these problems. Similarly, discussions over climate change and environmental lawmaking should involve more grassroot level participation. For most people, poverty and earnings still matter more than climate mitigation or adaptation. Hence people’s perception should be moulded to recognise and realise how deforestation or climate change impacts their daily life.  The Western Ghats are south India’s lifeline, with millions dependent on the range either directly or indirectly. These mountains need protection. However, while new development in the region continues to be human-centric, the entire concept of nature preservation is relegated. To protect the Western Ghats, what we require is an attitude that recognises the significance of these mountains, and that will involve specific laws."

"If targets were enough to beat the climate crisis, we would have cause for celebration. The UK, Norway, Sweden and France have written a target of net-zero emissions into law, and 15 others are considering similar legislation or have non-binding targets. Hundreds of cities, regions and individual companies have made similar pledges. Arguments are raging about whether these targets are good enough. Close reading of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s reports suggests that developed countries need to reach net zero within ten to 15 years if they are to give developing countries some leeway. That’s long before the date most countries have committed to. Yet this row masks a more fundamental truth: targets are, by definition, a statement of nothing more than intent. In and of themselves, they do not remove a single molecule of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that they may even be counterproductive. The UK was the first in the world to introduce binding carbon targets a decade ago – but governments have since dismantled or scaled back many climate policies in recent years. Independent government advisers the Committee on Climate Change have repeatedly warned that the UK is off track to meet future commitments.  Yet whenever government ministers are challenged on climate policy, their response is indignant. Of course, we are serious about tackling climate change, they say, because we have ambitious targets. By this logic, any policy can be countenanced – even if it moves emissions in the wrong direction. In the words of the independent think tank the Institute for Government, targets can be “a low-cost way for the government to give the appearance of vigorous action”. If governments are serious about tackling the climate crisis, radical policies are needed to match radical targets. Here are five measures with immediate impacts that would put them on track. Responsibility for climate action should not be assigned to an individual ministry. The Prime Minister’s Office or the Treasury (and equivalent offices around the world) should be tasked with the job of coordinating climate action across all areas of government, requiring each ministry to demonstrate progress.  The UK’s transport ministry, for example, is currently able to assume that increases in transport emissions will be offset by reductions elsewhere in the economy. With the proposed setup, it would be required to show how its policies would contribute to emissions cuts. The second is to involve and engage people in the transition to zero-carbon. My research has shown that politicians have attempted to impose climate policies through stealth, shying away from open discussion and assuming that experts know best. This is profoundly undemocratic, and likely to backfire. Climate action should be seen as a constant negotiation between citizen and state – a social contract. Research shows that people are willing to make changes in their own lives if they see this as part of a wider national effort to cut emissions.

      To tackle the climate crisis we need more democracy, not less


 More use of participatory forms of politics, such as Citizens’ Assemblies, could help to develop climate strategies which engage, rather than ignore, the population. We also need to work closely with communities who would otherwise stand to lose from climate action, such as coal miners and oil workers, to give them a “just transition” away from carbon. That means comprehensive support, not just a vague promise of green jobs. Third, and linked, governments should implement what public opinion expert Deborah Mattinson calls “symbolic policies”. These are policies with tangible impacts that also raise the political profile of climate action. They galvanise citizens and send businesses a clear message about what investment climate to expect in the future, catalysing radical, rather than incremental, change. A right to generate and sell renewable energy at home or in the community might be one such policy. A ban on advertising petrol and diesel cars, which many countries are phasing out anyway, would be another. A green jobs guarantee, as proposed by the US’s Green New Deal, would also catch the eye. Finally, with careful messaging, personal and business carbon allowances could be both highly effective at reducing emissions and surprisingly popular. Fourth, a strategy for the climate emergency must make explicit and tangible commitments to the transition away from fossil fuels. It is clear that the global commitment to limiting warming to 1.5℃ requires us to leave most known fossil fuel reserves untouched. The banner-friendly activist slogan “Keep it in the ground” is an accurate representation of the best scientific evidence. Until now, most climate strategies have been silent on this point. The UK and Norway congratulate themselves on net-zero targets, yet both have plans to continue oil and gas extraction. Governments must impose a moratorium on fossil fuel exploration, end the £300 billion in tax breaks they give annually to fossil fuel industries, and use the spare cash to help workers and industries transition to a clean energy revolution.  Last, any national strategy must separate out the contribution of negative emissions technologies from its net zero targets. The theory is that carbon emissions that cannot be avoided will be counterbalanced by these technologies. But, as research from myself and colleagues at Lancaster University show, relying on these technologies – whose feasibility is not yet known – distracts resources away from reducing how much carbon we emit. Creating distinct targets and funding for carbon capture will ground the sector to what it can realistically hope to remove from the atmosphere, and stop the wilder, unfounded promises that limit ambition for climate action. I would never argue against setting climate targets. They are necessary – but far from sufficient. We must guard against politicians hiding behind distant and possibly empty promises, and demand climate policy that impacts the carbon ledger here and now.

"Nearly a third of the world’s oceans and land area could be placed under environmental protections without harming the global economy, and even produce bumper economic benefits if the right policies were followed, according to a global assessment. Ecosystems around the world are collapsing or hovering on the brink of disaster, with a million species threatened with extinction. But if at least 30% of the planet’s land and oceans were subject to conservation efforts, that mass extinction could be avoided and vital habitats restored, scientists estimate.  The independent report, commissioned by the Campaign for Nature charity, found about $140bn (£110bn) a year would be required by 2030 to place 30% of land and sea under protection. Anthony Waldron, the report’s lead author, said: “Our report shows that protection in today’s economy brings in more revenue than the alternative and adds revenue to agriculture and forestry, while helping prevent climate change, water crises, biodiversity loss and disease. Increasing nature protection is sound policy for governments juggling multiple interests. You cannot put a price tag on nature, but the economic numbers point to its protection.” Such a target would require a doubling of the area of land under protection, which is roughly 15% of land globally, and more than a quadrupling of marine protected areas, which make up only 7% of the oceans currently. About $24bn is spent annually around the world on nature-protected areas. With land and seas under fierce commercial pressure from agriculture, fishing and extractive industries, protecting nature has conventionally been seen as an economic cost. The new assessment turns the conventional analysis on its head, showing that nature conservation is in fact a net contributor to the global economy, not a drain. Achieving the target of 30% protection would lead to increased economic output of between $64bn and $454bn a year, the report found, depending on which areas were subject to conservation efforts, as well as generating other benefits. “There is a large financial return if we protect 30% of terrestrial and marine nature,” said Thomas Lovejoy, a professor of environmental science at George Mason University in Virginia, US. “Protecting the goose does indeed produce golden eggs.” Restoring nature is increasingly being seen as vital to tackling both the causes and impacts of climate breakdown, providing long-term protections against the effects of extreme weather such as flooding, storms and drought. Coastal mangrove swamps and coral reefs, for instance, have been destroyed over decades but when restored they provide valuable protection from floods and storm surges, as well as acting as nurseries for young fish. The report found that protecting forests and mangroves would reduce the economic losses from the climate crisis and other harms by $170bn to $534bn a year by 2050. Protecting land can produce benefits in the surrounding areas, such as vegetation reducing air pollution, and river systems providing clean water, as well as liveable habitats for numerous wild species. Nature conservation is projected to provide economic growth of 4-6% a year, compared with 1% a year for agriculture, fisheries and forestry, after the coronavirus pandemic subsides. Fisheries provide another example of how natural protection can work in practice and produce economic as well as environmental benefits. Areas of sea can be declared off-limits to fishing, oil drilling and other extractive industries, and left alone for fish populations to recover. While there is an economic shock in the short term to fishing fleets that had used the protected areas, within a few years fish populations can usually bounce back, creating long-term sustainable stocks that can also benefit surrounding areas. Many of the benefits of restoring nature are less tangible, but no less real. For instance, a growing body of research has connected people’s contact with nature with improvements in their physical wellbeing and mental outlook. The Campaign for Nature report cites a recent study that put the economic value of protected areas based on the improved mental health of visitors at $6tn a year. Jamison Ervin of the UN Development Programme said that as nature provides about $125tn in assets to humanity, the cost of protecting 30% of the planet was cheap by comparison. “The benefits to humanity are incalculable and the cost of inaction is unthinkable. This report unequivocally tells us that the time to finance nature, for people and for planet, is now.” • This article was updated on 9 July 2020. An earlier version described the report as being “from” the Campaign for Nature, whereas it was commissioned by the charity and authored by an independent team led by Dr Anthony Waldron of the University of Cambridge."

Back in 2009, it was 200 million climate refugees according to this article in the NYT:
There could be 200 million of these climate refugees by 2050, according to a new policy paper by the International Organization for Migration, depending on the degree of climate disturbances.
Now the claim is up to 5 times that by 2050 in the space of five years, at this rate of increase, the entire world population will be ‘climate refugees’ by 2050.
From Smithsonian Magazine by Jerry Adler:
The Reality of a Hotter World is Already Here
As global warming makes sizzling temperatures more common, will human beings be able to keep their cool? New research suggests not

The various environmental effects of greenhouse gases are potentially devastating, as we have often heard. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, made public in March, underscored the danger of widespread hunger, even starvation, resulting from crop failures. Other health threats have been enumerated by Robert Repetto, a United Nations Foundation economist, who says climate change will intensify smog, leading to “increased outbreaks of asthma and allergies,” and “exacerbate vector-borne diseases such as hantavirus, West Nile virus, Lyme disease and dengue fever.” Repetto also worries about the “extreme weather events” that some researchers say climate change will engender. “Biological systems and engineering systems are all designed for a range of climatic conditions,” he says. “Within those limits, we’re OK, …but outside those limits, the damage increases rapidly and becomes catastrophic, and we’re going outside those limits.” Heat waves themselves pose a health risk, especially for young children and the elderly—and world-class athletes. Temperatures at the Australian Open in January reached 104 degrees for four consecutive days, a condition that one tennis player called “inhumane” after competitors collapsed on the court.
(Gosh, it gets hot in Australia in summer? Who knew?)
…
There may be hordes of climate refugees, fleeing homes on islands and coasts made uninhabitable by climate change—anywhere from 25 million to 1 billion people by 2050, according to the International Organization for Migration. Even people who don’t have to move will experience a bewildering sense of dislocation as the environment changes around them—as Northern winters start to be measured in weeks rather than months. Glenn Albrecht, an Australian philosopher, coined the term “solastalgia” for this emotion, a kind of homesickness you can experience without leaving home.
“We will see the emergence of novel climates, environments we’ve not seen before in human times, and the extinction of others, around the Arctic and in high Alpine regions,” says Laurence C. Smith, a professor of geography at UCLA and author of The World in 2050. Smith says cities, industry and agriculture may benefit in places such as Canada and Scandinavia, though at some cost in psychological and cultural disruption. “Very bitterly cold winters will be less common in some places,” he says, “but instead of a nice blanket of white snow, they will have slush.” And people who move north for the weather, or for jobs that may open up as the Arctic melts, will discover that climate change doesn’t make the winter nights any shorter.

Press Release: **NZ First**  




 **Rt Hon Winston Peters, New Zealand First Leader**



New Zealand First is proud to have brought **common sense** to the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Bill, which passed its final reading in Parliament today.



Party Leader Rt Hon Winston Peters says months of hard work went into **negotiating a balanced outcome** between the parties of government on the issue.



“New Zealand First fought for a predictable transition for our farming community and sensible measures to reduce emissions. We listened to the agricultural sector and were determined that some of their key markers were acted upon.



“A reigned-in Climate Commission mandate, split gas targets for carbon dioxide and biogenic methane and a predictable methane reduction path from 2020 to 2030 are among the **key changes to the bill New Zealand First negotiated.**



“We are proud to have formed a practical consensus across government parties that gives industry certainty about the direction of travel of our climate change efforts,” says Mr Peters.



The Coalition Government has also delayed agriculture’s entry into the Emissions Trading Scheme until at least 2025 through a world-first partnership with the sector, and has committed to investing in technology and strategies to help reduce on-farm emissions.



“The farming community is not alone in this transition,” says Mr Peters.



Mr Peters also **welcomed the Opposition’s support** for the Coalition Government’s flagship climate change legislation.



“Despite twisting and turning at every step, National realised the strength of the governing parties’ resolve and notwithstanding attempts to mischaracterise this historic legislation, and empty promises about future changes they won’t be in a position to deliver, folded like lambs,” says Mr Peters.

As of today, there are currently 1453 known potentially hazardous asteroids that could impact Earth and cause a real planetary catastrophe. Given the new diverse “snow globe” model of our solar system in relation to asteroids, how may more don’t we know about? It only takes one. Of more pragmatic interest, this new paper suggests a diverse asteroid population stirred up in the ‘snow globe’ model was essential to bringing water to Earth.
From the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics Cambridge, MA –
Our solar system seems like a neat and orderly place, with small, rocky worlds near the Sun and big, gaseous worlds farther out, all eight planets following orbital paths unchanged since they formed.

However, the true history of the solar system is more riotous. Giant planets migrated in and out, tossing interplanetary flotsam and jetsam far and wide. New clues to this tumultuous past come from the asteroid belt.
“We found that the giant planets shook up the asteroids like flakes in a snow globe,” says lead author Francesca DeMeo, a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
Millions of asteroids circle the Sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, in a region known as the main asteroid belt. Traditionally, they were viewed as the pieces of a failed planet that was prevented from forming by the influence of Jupiter’s powerful gravity. Their compositions seemed to vary methodically from drier to wetter, due to the drop in temperature as you move away from the Sun.
That traditional view changed as astronomers recognized that the current residents of the main asteroid belt weren’t all there from the start. In the early history of our solar system the giant planets ran amok, migrating inward and outward substantially. Jupiter may have moved as close to the Sun as Mars is now. In the process, it swept the asteroid belt nearly clean, leaving only a tenth of one percent of its original population.
As the planets migrated, they stirred the contents of the solar system. Objects from as close to the Sun as Mercury, and as far out as Neptune, all collected in the main asteroid belt.
“The asteroid belt is a melting pot of objects arriving from diverse locations and backgrounds,” explains DeMeo.
Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, DeMeo and co-author Benoit Carry (Paris Observatory) examined the compositions of thousands of asteroids within the main belt. They found that the asteroid belt is more diverse than previously realized, especially when you look at the smaller asteroids.
This finding has interesting implications for the history of Earth. Astronomers have theorized that long-ago asteroid impacts delivered much of the water now filling Earth’s oceans. If true, the stirring provided by migrating planets may have been essential to bringing those asteroids.
This raises the question of whether an Earth-like exoplanet would also require a rain of asteroids to bring water and make it habitable. If so, then Earth-like worlds might be rarer than we thought.
The paper describing these findings appears in the January 30, 2014 issue of Nature.
Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) is a joint collaboration between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory. CfA scientists, organized into six research divisions, study the origin, evolution and ultimate fate of the universe.

"**A huge radio telescope in Puerto Rico has collapsed after decades of astronomical discoveries.**
The US National Science Foundation (NSF) said the telescope's 900-ton instrument platform fell onto a reflector dish some 450ft (137m) below.
It came just weeks after officials announced that the telescope would be dismantled amid safety fears, following damage to its support system.
The Arecibo Observatory telescope was one of the largest in the world.
It was a key scientific resource for radio astronomers for 57 years, and was also made famous as the backdrop for a scene in the James Bond film GoldenEye and other Hollywood movies.
The NSF said there had been no reports of injuries following the collapse.
The NSF said the telescope collapsed at about 07:55 local time (11:55 GMT) on Tuesday, ""resulting in damage to the dish and surrounding facilities"".
The telescope consisted of a 1,000ft-wide radio dish with an instrument platform hanging 450ft above. The platform was suspended by cables connected to three towers.
The NSF said an investigation into the platform's fall was ongoing.
""Initial findings indicate that the top section of all three of the... telescope's support towers broke off. As the 900-ton instrument platform fell, the telescope's support cables also dropped,"" it said in a statement.
""Preliminary assessments indicate the observatory's learning centre sustained significant damage from falling cables,"" it added.
Two cables had broken since August, damaging the structure and forcing officials to close the observatory.
A review last month found that the telescope was at risk of catastrophic collapse and said the huge structure could not be repaired without posing a potentially deadly risk to construction workers.
Officials said the structure would be dismantled.
Following the announcement, three members of Congress, including Puerto Rico's representative Jenniffer GonzÃ¡lez, requested funds ""to enable the NSF to continue exploring options to safely stabilise the structure"".
Jonathan Friedman, who worked for 26 years as a senior research associate at the observatory and still lives near it, told the Associated Press news agency of the moment the telescope collapsed on Tuesday.
""It sounded like a rumble. I knew exactly what it was,"" he said. ""I was screaming. Personally, I was out of control... I don't have words to express it. It's a very deep, terrible feeling.""
The NSF said it was ""saddened"" by the collapse and would be ""looking for ways to assist the scientific community and maintain our strong relationship with the people of Puerto Rico"".
""Top priorities are maintaining safety at the site, conducting a complete damage assessment as quickly as possible, and taking action to contain and mitigate any environmental damage caused by the structure or its materials.
""While the telescope was a key part of the facility, the observatory has other scientific and educational infrastructure that NSF will work with stakeholders to bring back online,"" the agency said.

The telescope was built in the early 1960s, with the intention of studying the ionised upper part of Earth's atmosphere, the ionosphere. But it was soon being used as an all-purpose radio observatory.
Radio astronomy is a field within the larger discipline that observes objects in the Universe by studying them at radio frequencies. A number of cosmic phenomena such as pulsars - magnetised, rotating stars - show emission at radio wavelengths.
The observatory provided the first solid evidence for a type of object known as a neutron star. It was also used to identify the first example of a binary pulsar (two magnetised neutron stars orbiting around a common centre of mass), which earned its discoverers the Nobel Prize in Physics.
The telescope helped to make the first definitive detection of exoplanets, planetary bodies orbiting other stars, in 1992.
It has also been used to listen for signals from intelligent life elsewhere in the cosmos and to track near-Earth asteroids.
Over the years, the main dish appeared as a location in movies, including GoldenEye, Pierce Brosnan's first outing as James Bond in 1995, and the 1997 science fiction drama Contact, starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey."
"Environmental groups have reacted with disappointment to details of the government’s Covid-19 economic rescue package released by the Treasury. On Monday night the government announced some details of the announcement expected on Wednesday, including a £1bn energy efficiency upgrade for public buildings and insulation for some social tenants, who could save up to £200 a year on their energy bills as a result. A Green Jobs Challenge fund will provide £40m for green charities working on improving England’s landscapes, with the money to be spent on projects such as tree-planting and cleaning up rivers. A further £50m will go to innovative approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from social housing. In all, at least £3bn will be made available for greening the recovery, according to the Treasury, which the government said would “support tens of thousands of green jobs”, as well as reducing the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions and helping to “build back greener”. But the big question for environmental campaigners was: is that it? “Surely this is just a downpayment?” asked Rosie Rogers, head of green recovery at Greenpeace UK. She pointed to the German government’s £36bn investment in measures to boost the economy while cutting emissions, with France spending £13.5bn to the same end. If the total green element of the economic rescue package ends up at £3bn, that would be “not playing in the same league”, she said. Ed Matthew, associate director of the E3G environmental thinktank, said £18bn was needed in the next 10 years to make all buildings energy efficient and get the UK on track to meet its net zero emissions target by 2050. “The funding announced today is a decent start only if it is a downpayment on a much larger, more ambitious investment programme,” he said. The Treasury declined to provide a detailed breakdown of the spending before the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, delivers his full summer economic update on Wednesday. A spokesperson told the Guardian: “The government remains committed to decarbonising buildings to keep us on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The funding expected to be announced this week represents a significant and accelerated downpayment on decarbonising buildings, to help stimulate the economic recovery and create green jobs. Allocations for future funding will be determined in due course.” Energy efficiency for the UK’s homes – the draughtiest in Europe – is essential to cutting Britain’s greenhouse gas emissions, as home heating accounts for about a fifth of the UK’s carbon output. Warmer homes for social tenants could lower annual energy bills by £200 for some of the poorest households, the government estimates. Retrofitting homes with better insulation, higher standard glazing and doors, and other relatively straightforward measures would also create large numbers of jobs – hundreds of thousands of jobs, potentially, by some estimates. In the Conservative election manifesto last December, there was a promise to devote at least £9.2bn to energy efficiency programmes in this parliament. A wide range of economic experts, including the government’s own advisers, the Committee on Climate Change, have also urged a focus on insulating homes. Yet the government appears to have doubts. Previous attempts at nationwide insulation programmes over the past two decades were often piecemeal, or relied on incentives such as putative bill savings that were not enough to persuade people to undergo the renovation required. The last attempt, the Green Deal, sputtered out soon after the coalition did in 2015, and there has been no central government programme on home insulation since then. Green campaigners are waiting to see whether the chancellor will unveil spending closer to the government’s £9.2bn manifesto commitment when he delivers his update on Wednesday. If much greater ambition is not forthcoming, they are likely to brand the government’s attempts at a green recovery a failure. Katie White, executive director of advocacy and campaigns at WWF, said its research had shown £90bn of benefits to the UK economy from investing in a green recovery. “But a recovery where we ignore climate and nature is not a recovery at all – it is starting the timer for the next crisis. All eyes will be on the chancellor’s speech to see if ambitions will truly meet the future challenges we face,” she said."

One of the most worrisome aspects of the climate science movement, other than its outright fudging of data, is its unabashed contempt for democracy.
Yesterday a tiny group of “17 international scientists from world class institutions“, who are unhappy with the current development course of civilization because it has not been to their liking, released in a statement the elements of a global climate agreement, and “what needs to be done in order to meet the 2°C target.”
The 17 elitist “scientists” call themselves “The Earth League“.
Not surprisingly the statement calls for the fundamental reorganization of global human civilization and society.
Yesterday the ultra-alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) also published a press release about that statement from the “international alliance of prominent scientists“, which calls for “bold action by decision-makers to pave the way for a successful international agreement to reduce the risk of dangerous climate change“. The Earth League statement announces:
It is a moral obligation, and in our self-interest, to achieve deep decarbonization of the global economy via equitable effort sharing. This requires reaching a zero-carbon society by mid-century or shortly thereafter, thereby limiting global warming to below 2°C as agreed by all nations in 2010. This trajectory is not one of economic pain, but of economic opportunity, progress and inclusiveness.”
Such promises of zero-pain are not new. Ten years ago Germany’s Environment Minister Jürgen Trittin claimed the transition would “not cost citizens more than a cone of ice cream“. That cone of ice cream today has since exploded to 355 euros – each year – and CO2 emissions still haven’t dropped!
The Earth League’s statement coincides with Earth Day. Not surprisingly among its members is PIK director Hans Joachim Schellnhuber. The statement clarifies what an international climate agreement should achieve in Paris in December.
The scientists include Mario Molina of Centro Mario Molina, Jennifer Morgan of the World Resources Institute, Ottmar Edenhofer of Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, Carlos Nobre of National Institute for Space Research (INPE) (and UNESCO), Lord Nicholas Stern of London School of Economics and Political Science, Johan Rockström of Stockholm Resilience Center and other authors.

People familiar with the PIK recognize that this is very much a “Schellnhubris” Potsdam initiative. Indeed it is amazing to see them claim “scientist” status for Jennifer Morgan, former WWF Climate Director and now a member of the Potsdam “Scientific Advisory Board”.  Her qualifications are in Political Science and “International Affairs”. Former World Bank economist Stern is chairman of the Grantham Institute at LSE and has also been on Schellnhuber’s Potsdam “Scientific Advisory Board”.
Edenhofer is also an economist and deputy director at Potsdam, although he is now named as Director of yet another new institution, the Mercator Institute on Global Commons, (that’s the air we breathe, in their book and it must be regulated so everyone gets their fair share. The West has had more than its fair share so we must recant and breathe less). He is famous for his quote that it is no longer about the science, but about wealth redistribution.
Rockström is a long term campaigner, an ecologist not a climate scientist and formerly at the Beijer Instituite which has merged with the Stockholm Resilience Centre. He is the vice-chair of the science advisory board at Potsdam and “he was also co-chairing the visioning process on global environmental change of ICSU, the International Council for Science.”
The Earth League does have a few scientists onboard, such as Sir Brian Hoskins, IPCC and Director of the Imperial College, London, Grantham Institute. He is also on Schellnhuber’s “Scientific Advisory Board”.
Another non-scientist is Leena Srivastava, deputy to the currently “on leave of absence” Rajendra Pachauri.

Of course none of these 17 “leading scientists” will ever admit their contempt for democracy, yet their demands tell us a different story. What their statement tells us is: Yes, citizens are allowed to elect their leaders, but the leaders must do what us elite “scientists” tell them. If that is not contempt for the democratic process, then what is? The PIK Press release writes:
The Earth Statement will be presented by Rockström and Schellnhuber at the 4th Nobel Laureates Symposium on Global Sustainability in Hong Kong “4C: Changing Climate, Changing Cities” hosted by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Asia Society Hong Kong (22-25 April) on Thursday – this will mark the beginning of outreach to leading decision-makers and thinkers.”
Welcome to the next wave of authoritarianism.

"**Two leading UK firms - the insurer Aviva and the Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) - have become the latest to ""pause"" advertising on Facebook.**
They join Ford, Adidas, HP, Coca Cola, Unilever and Starbucks, which have all acted in response to how the social network deals with hate speech.
The Stop Hate for Profit campaign claims that Facebook is not doing enough to remove hateful content.
Facebook has said it wants to be a force for good.
Ahead of the latest developments, the tech firm's UK director Steve Hatch told the BBC that ""there was no profit in content that is hateful"".
In a statement to the BBC, Aviva said: ""We regularly review which social media platforms we use and have taken this moment to pause and reassess Aviva's use of Facebook for advertising in the UK.""
IHG added it had recently taken the decision to suspend advertising ""through Facebook globally"" but did not provide additional context. The Buckinghamshire-based firm operates under the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Kimpton brands, among others.
Meanwhile in the US, the retailer Target and chocolate-maker Mars were the latest big names to announce they were acting likewise.
Mars's temporary halt will extend to Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat.
""Mars has a responsibility and an opportunity to make a meaningful and measurable difference in the fight against racism, hate, violence and discrimination - we expect all of the social media platform partners we work with to do the same,"" it said.
News agency Reuters reported that Facebook had hosted a conference call with advertisers to discuss an audit of how it deals with hate in its latest effort to tackle the backlash.
Hundreds of brands around the world have hit pause on their Facebook advertising in response to Stop Hate for Profit's call for a boycott. Some have also suspended ads on other social media platforms.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hatch defended Facebook's record on hate speech.
""Our systems now remove 90% of and detect 90% of that hate speech automatically. And now that's not perfect, but we do know that it's up from 23% two years ago,"" he said.
""As much as we do our very best, and there's always more that we can do and that we will do - when there's hate in the world, there will also be hate on Facebook.
""The way that our systems work are to provide people with the content that is most often in millions and millions of cases both enjoyable and safe, and also to enable people to have a discussion.""
Facebook has come under increasing fire since it decided not to remove a post by US President Donald Trump, written in response to the protests across the US over the death of George Floyd.
A comment made by the president - ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"" - was deemed to glorify violence and labelled as such by rival Twitter but remained on Facebook.
Mr Hatch said: ""The debates that we see around these topics are extremely challenging and can be very, very wide-ranging.""
But Facebook's inaction left many angry, and kick-started the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which wants big brands to boycott the social network during July.
Some advertisers have paused social media spending on Facebook for just that month, while others are planning longer periods.
On Friday, Facebook's share price dropped by 8%. In response it has said it will start to label potentially harmful posts.
A survey from the World Federation of Advertisers suggests that others are likely to follow suit, and that other platforms such as Twitter and Snapchat may also be included.
Its chief executive told the Financial Times that it felt like ""a turning point"".
**By James Clayton, technology reporter, North America**
By far the most notable British company to have joined the boycott so far has been Unilever. But Unilever has a huge US presence - it owns Ben and Jerry's for example.
Aviva doesn't. This is a very British boycott, it only affects the UK.
Facebook has been worried about the spread of this boycott to the rest of the world.
On Monday Stop Hate for Profit - the organisation that has spearheaded the campaign in the US - announced it wanted to take the campaign global.
And this is an example of just that, a British company pausing its use of Facebook in Britain.
How much will this worry Facebook? Well each company that joins the boycott incrementally chips away at the company's ad revenue.
However, it's not thought Facebook or Instagram makes up a large proportion of Aviva's ad spend, with TV and print larger."
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – the UN body responsible for communicating the science of climate breakdown – has released its long-awaited Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate.  Based on almost 7,000 peer-reviewed research articles, the report is a cutting-edge crash course in how human-caused climate breakdown is changing our ice and oceans and what it means for humanity and the living planet. In a nutshell, the news isn’t good. Most of us rarely come into contact with the cryosphere, but it is a critical part of our climate system. The term refers to the frozen parts of our planet – the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, the icebergs that break off and drift in the oceans, the glaciers on our high mountain ranges, our winter snow, the ice on lakes and the polar oceans, and the frozen ground in much of the Arctic landscape called permafrost.

      What is the cryosphere? Hint: It's vital to farming, fishing and skiing


 The cryosphere is shrinking. Snow cover is reducing, glaciers and ice sheets are melting and permafrost is thawing. We’ve known this for most of my 25-year career, but the report highlights that melting is accelerating, with potentially disastrous consequences for humanity and marine and high mountain ecosystems. At the moment, we’re on track to lose more than half of all the permafrost by the end of the century. Thousands of roads and buildings sit on this frozen soil – and their foundations are slowly transitioning to mud. Permafrost also stores almost twice the amount of carbon as is present in the atmosphere. While increased plant growth may be able to offset some of the release of carbon from newly thawed soils, much will be released to the atmosphere, significantly accelerating the pace of global heating. Sea ice is declining rapidly, and an ice-free Arctic ocean will become a regular summer occurrence as things stand. Indigenous peoples who live in the Arctic are already having to change how they hunt and travel, and some coastal communities are already planning for relocation. Populations of seals, walruses, polar bears, whales and other mammals and sea birds who depend on the ice may crash if sea ice is regularly absent. And as water in its bright-white solid form is much more effective at reflecting heat from the sun, its rapid loss is also accelerating global heating. Glaciers are also melting. If emissions continue on their current trajectory, smaller glaciers will shrink by more than 80% by the end of the century. This retreat will place increasing strain on the hundreds of millions of people globally who rely on glaciers for water, agriculture, and power. Dangerous landslides, avalanches, rockfalls and floods will become increasingly normal in mountain areas. All this melting ice means that sea levels are rising. While seas rose globally by around 15cm during the 20th century, they’re now rising more than twice as fast –- and this rate is accelerating. Thanks to research from myself and others, we now better understand how Antarctica and Greenland’s ice sheets interact with the oceans. As a result, the latest report has upgraded its long-term estimates for how much sea level is expected to rise. Uncertainties still remain, but we’re headed for a rise of between 60 and 110cm by 2100. Of course, sea level isn’t static. Intense rainfall and cyclones – themselves exacerbated by climate breakdown – can cause water to surge metres above the normal level. The IPCC’s report is very clear: these extreme storm surges we used to expect once per century will now be expected every year by mid-century. In addition to rapidly curbing emissions, we must invest millions to protect at-risk coastal and low-lying areas from flooding and loss of life. Up to now, the ocean has taken up more than 90% of the excess heat in the global climate system. Warming to date has already reduced the mixing between water layers and, as a consequence, has reduced the supply of oxygen and nutrients for marine life. By 2100 the ocean will take up five to seven times more heat than it has done in the past 50 years if we don’t change our emissions trajectory. Marine heatwaves are also projected to be more intense, last longer and occur 50 times more often. To top it off, the ocean is becoming more acidic as it continues to absorb a proportion of the carbon dioxide we emit. Collectively, these pressures place marine life across the globe under unprecedented threat. Some species may move to new waters, but others less able to adapt will decline or even die out. This could cause major problems for communities that depend on local seafood. As it stands, coral reefs – beautiful ecosystems that support thousands of species – will be nearly totally wiped out by the end of the century.  While the document makes some striking statements, it is actually relatively conservative with its conclusions – perhaps because it had to be approved by the 195 nations that ratify the IPCC’s reports. Right now, I would expect that sea level rise and ice melt will occur faster than the report predicts. Ten years ago, I might have said the opposite. But the latest science is painting an increasingly grave picture for the future of our oceans and cryosphere – particularly if we carry on with “business as usual”.

      Not convinced on the need for urgent climate action? Here's what happens to our planet between 1.5°C and 2°C of global warming


 The difference between 1.5°C and 2°C of heating is especially important for the icy poles, which warm much faster than the global average. At 1.5°C of warming, the probability of an ice-free September in the Arctic ocean is one in 100. But at 2°C, we’d expect to see this happening about one-third of the time. Rising sea levels, ocean warming and acidification, melting glaciers, and permafrost also will also happen faster – and with it, the risks to humanity and the living planet increase.

"The Super Bowl is a popular destination for commercials showcasing premium water, candy and beer  —   but politics can make it a difficult forum. 84 Lumber, a private supplier of building materials in Pennsylvania that is advertising during the game for the first time this year, said it was forced to alter its plans for a commercial after Fox deemed its depiction of a   mother and daughter confronting a border wall between the United States and Mexico, which President Trump has pledged to build, as “too controversial. ” The ad, slated to run before halftime during the network’s broadcast of the game on Sunday, will now showcase the pair on a journey, but omit the wall. Instead, the address of a website will appear on the screen, giving viewers a chance to see how their story ends. “I still can’t even understand why it was censored,” Maggie Hardy Magerko, 84 Lumber’s president and owner, said in an interview this week. “In fact, I’m flabbergasted by that in today’s day and age. It’s not pornographic, it’s not immoral, it’s not racist. ” Advertisers pay millions of dollars for commercial space during the game, but the network and the National Football League maintain the right to approve any ad. “We review spots to ensure they do not violate our advertising policies,” a league spokesman, Brian McCarthy, said in an email. “The ad that will air does not violate our policies. ” He did not say if the N. F. L. had asked for 84 Lumber’s original commercial to be altered. Fox declined to comment, but the network’s advertising guidelines online say that, in general, it will not sell commercial time “for viewpoint or advocacy of controversial issues. ” It adds that advertisers cannot use the space to address such topics. But with political tension in the country running high since the election of Mr. Trump, keeping politics completely away from the broadcast is a difficult task. Budweiser, for instance, has gained notice it wasn’t anticipating for its Super Bowl ad. The commercial, which was released online this week and has passed two million views on YouTube, recounts how the brewery’s   immigrated to the United States from Germany in the 1800s and notes the discrimination he overcame. Budweiser has emphasized that it is not responding to Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown last weekend. “We believe beer should be bipartisan, and did not set out to create a piece of political commentary,” Marcel Marcondes, vice president for marketing at   InBev, said in a statement. “However, we recognize that you can’t reference the American dream today without being part of the conversation. ” In 2012, a Chrysler Super Bowl ad featuring Clint Eastwood was seen by some conservatives as pandering to President Barack Obama after his administration’s bailout of automakers. In the case of 84 Lumber, Ms. Magerko said that Fox vetoed the initial idea based on a storyboard of the proposed commercial from Brunner, the company’s ad agency. That document, which was reviewed by The New York Times, said the commercial would show a mother and daughter on “an arduous journey north,” as American workers built a large structure. Their journey appeared doomed once they reached the wall until a patriotic symbol inspired them to find a massive doorway  —   which is what the workers were creating all along. The final line: “The will to succeed will always be welcome here. ” Ms. Magerko, who said she voted for Mr. Trump, said the ad was meant to recruit employees in their 20s “who really believe in American dreams. ” She expressed concern about the labor shortage her company is facing. She said she had a welcoming attitude toward certain immigrants, while providing the caveat that she had faith in elected officials to “make the decisions to make us safe. ” “I am all about those people who are willing to fight and go that extra yard to make a difference and then if they have to, you know, climb higher, go under, do whatever it takes to become a citizen. I am all for that 110 percent,” she said. “But do I want cartels? Hell, no. ” It has become a marketing strategy of sorts over the years to intentionally create a Super Bowl ad that will never make it to air, then capitalize on online traffic. But Ms. Magerko said that was not 84 Lumber’s plan, noting that the company is still showing the edited   spot that Fox has approved. Ms. Magerko said that some people might think she was “as crazy as a loon to go out there and buy this enormous ad that makes no sense financially. ” “I’m sure I’m going to have economists and all these people say she’s an idiot, and maybe I am,” she said. “But I’m an idiot that has some money now that my people made for me, and I owe it to them to say that they’re great and I need more people like them. ” A company representative confirmed that it spent more than $5 million on the ad, which was the average rate this year for 30 seconds. The company, which draws about $2. 9 billion in revenue a year and has been rebuilding since the recession, is keen on igniting a conversation around housing and labor, she said. As for immigration and the wall, “We didn’t know this was going to be the hot topic six weeks ago,” Ms. Magerko said. “We knew it was a topic. We didn’t know it was the topic. ”"
"**A man who donated an old camera to a charity shop has been handed pictures he took of his late wife and son nearly 40 years ago.**
David Clarke, 48, from Harrold, Bedfordshire, found the undeveloped film in a Kodak Instamatic camera.
A Facebook appeal led him to John Salter, 82, who had taken the photos of his wife Barbara and son Ashley, both of whom have since died.
Mr Salter said seeing the images was a ""joyful experience.""
Professional photographer Mr Clarke collects old cameras, a hobby he has passed to his daughter Taya, 16.
She bought the camera from the nearby Emmaus Village Carlton.
When he discovered it still had film in it, he thought ""it would be nice"" to get it developed.
In a bid to trace their original owner, he posted the pictures on social media and heard from Simon Liddle, a former friend from Rushden Boys' School in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Mr Liddle recognised himself in one of the photos, along with his brother Gary, mum Rose and father Bill, and his uncle John, aunt Barbara and cousin Ashley Salter.
""It was a nice shock to see them,"" he said.
He then connected with his old friend on Facebook.
Mr Clarke said: ""It was really nice to be put in touch with people you have forgotten about.
""There's a family out there that have now got pictures that they were missing.""
Mr Salter, 82, from Bedford, but now living in Lavendon, Buckinghamshire, said he donated the camera to the charity as he was having a clear-out.
""I thought it would be useful to someone else, and lo and behold, it was,"" he said.
""In these rather torrid times it was nice to have a good news story. It really made me smile.""

 ** _Congress should_**



• repeal the prohibition on soft money fundraising in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002;  
• repeal limits on spending coordinated between a political party and its candidates;  
• repeal contribution limits in federal campaign finance law;  
• carefully scrutinize the views of Supreme Court nominees about free speech and campaign finance;  
• reject the future iterations of the DISCLOSE Act as well as other attempts to curtail free speech through onerous and unnecessary disclosure rules; and  
• ensure that nonqualified agencies such as the SEC and the IRS are restrained from interfering with election‐​related spending.



The 107th Congress passed the most sweeping new restrictions on campaign finance in a generation, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA, also known as the McCain‐​Feingold Act). During the 108th Congress, the Supreme Court approved almost all of BCRA. Since then, the Court has become much more protective of free speech. In _Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission_ (2010), the Court held that Congress could not prohibit corporations and unions from spending independently on speech supporting or opposing candidates. A lower court later followed _Citizens United_ and found that individuals who form groups limited to independent spending could not be bound by contribution limits. Such “super” political action committees (PACs) have been important in recent elections. Although the courts have trimmed BCRA back, federal campaign finance law still limits free speech in important ways. Congress should supplement judicial efforts by eliminating restrictions on party funding and by removing contribution limits. Congress should also remain vigilant about challenges to these achievements during the 115th Congress.



The First Amendment to the Constitution prohibits governments from abridging the freedom of speech, and political speech receives the highest protection. In the seminal case of _Buckley v. Valeo_ (1976), the Supreme Court recognized that restrictions on political spending abridge political speech:



A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today’s mass society requires the expenditure of money.



Note that the Court did not say, “money equals speech.” But just as a restriction on money that can be spent on an abortion is a restriction on abortion, restrictions on the raising and spending of money used to disseminate political messages are ultimately restrictions on political speech.



Some believe there is “too much money” in elections, implying the nation would be better off with limits on giving. But people spend money to try to persuade voters to go to the polls, to cast a ballot for a particular candidate, or to support a particular issue. If we believe that the nation is better off if voters cast a more informed vote, we ought to encourage, not restrict, campaign spending. John J. Coleman of the University of Minnesota found that campaign spending increases public knowledge of the candidates across all groups in the population. Implicit or explicit spending limits reduce public knowledge during campaigns. When more money is spent on campaigns, voters and society benefit by improving public decisionmaking.



But Congress does limit spending on federal campaigns. In _Buckley v. Valeo_ , the Supreme Court upheld limits on contributions to candidates, concluding that limits on contributions served two important interests. The limits prevent “corruption and the appearance of corruption spawned by the real or imagined coercive influence of large financial contributions on candidates’ positions and on their actions if elected to office.” The Court defined corruption as exchange of large contributions for “a political _quid pro quo_ from current and potential office holders.” The Latin phrase _quid pro quo_ means “something for something.” This exchange, the Court continued, undermines “the integrity of our system of representative democracy.” Representatives should respond to the wishes of a majority on most matters; quid pro quo arrangements imply that representatives respond to money.



It is difficult to determine when contributions are offered in exchange for favors. Scholars of campaign finance have found that individuals and groups generally give to candidates and causes that already support their views. That makes sense: Is it easier to support a candidate who already shares your views or to spend enough money to induce a candidate to change his or her mind? Perhaps quid pro quo corruption exists when money changes a politician’s mind. Public officials might alter their vote about an issue in exchange for a contribution. But scholarly studies over many years find little evidence that contributions significantly affect policymaking once other factors (partisanship, ideology, and constituency preferences) are taken into account. In the name of countering the insignificant effect of contributions on politicians’ behavior, Congress has taken a sledgehammer to political speech, making election‐​related speech more heavily regulated than pornography.



Critics of political spending often say that politicians trade access for contributions. Sometimes they mean that officeholders meet with contributors to discuss their concerns and proposals. Let’s imagine, however, that a contribution goes toward advancing a candidate’s campaign rather than toward getting him to support policies he would not otherwise support. If the Flat Earth Society gives a candidate $50,000 (which is currently illegal), and the candidate agrees to meet with them to hear their concerns, is that problematic or is it just normal politics? Isn’t meeting with concerned citizens, even if they’re the Flat Earth Society, an essential part of democracy? “Access” in itself does not seem to be the problem. Rather, access becomes a problem if it is part of a quid pro quo relationship involving money rather than politics.



Independent spending on speech for or against candidates exceeds money spent by candidates themselves. Some argue that public officials know about and reward such support, creating a kind of quid pro quo. Evidence on this point is hard to come by. Those who spend large sums devote their efforts to one party or the other; such spending seems ideological or partisan, an expression of political commitment, rather than an attempt to buy policy favors.



The _Buckley_ Court decision also said contribution limits were justified by “the appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions.” The appearance of wrongdoing, the Court suggested, would erode public confidence in representative government. By limiting contributions, Congress would support public confidence in government. Now, many people from both parties believe that Congress is “corrupt,” but what they mean by “corruption” is usually difficult to discern. Sometimes “corruption” seems to be synonymous with “not enacting preferred policies”; thus, the lack of, say, single‐​payer health care is seen as evidence of corruption. In years past, however, when modern campaign finance restrictions were not in place, people tended to have much more trust in government. Our growing distrust of government seems to be a product of something other than political spending, such as the significant partisan divide currently in Washington.



Here is a summary of the relationship of contribution limits and trust in government. The United States had no limits on individual contributions during the era of highest trust in government. Trust in government and effective limits on donations have varied since that high point. In the era of no limits, trust rose until 1963 and then fell until 1974, when contribution limits were enacted. From 1974 until 1980, trust continued to fall. In 1980, the limits on giving to political parties were loosened; trust began to rise until 1986 when it plateaued and began to fall about 1989. Trust then started rising again after the middle of 1994 until the end of 2001. The McCain‐​Feingold law banned unlimited contributions to the parties in 2002; trust in government fell until about January 2010. _Citizens United_ effectively removed limits on independent spending in early 2010; since then, trust has varied in a narrow range, but the trend is flat. No doubt many factors affected public trust over the years, but both limited and unlimited campaign contributions seem consistent with rising and falling confidence in government. In the states, scholars have found campaign finance regulations “are simply not important determinants of trust and confidence in government.”



Contribution limits have another flaw. Individuals can donate only $2,700 to a candidate in an election; if they wish to give more, they must find a suitable super PAC. Looked at another way, contribution limits push some funding for political speech away from established channels and toward relatively new institutions (like super PACs) that exist because contribution limits curtail direct donations to candidates and because the First Amendment protects direct spending on speech. Many, but not all, donors would probably support speech through established institutions if they could, but the limits make that impossible.



Should federal law favor “outsiders” at a cost to “insiders”? Perhaps. Insiders might care too much about organized groups in the capital; outsiders can force the concerns of a broader public onto the public agenda. But, compared with parties, outsiders lack experience organizing and representing mass opinion. Resources may be wasted and civic‐​minded folks frustrated. Outsiders might also be more extreme in their commitments, a virtue or a vice depending on your point of view. Other arguments for and against insiders and outsiders come to mind. Which side should win the argument is not clear.



Let’s look at the issue in a different way. The voters are supposed to choose the government. If government favors one group over another, it helps choose itself. Election laws should instead be neutral toward those engaged in politics. Contribution limits are not neutral; they favor outside spending over established channels. Citizens, not public officials, should choose between insiders and outsiders. Removing contribution limits would mean that political spenders would not have a _legal reason_ to favor outsiders over insiders. A given spender may have a personal reason for preferring one mode of spending to another, but the law should be neutral between the two.



The question of neutrality goes beyond individual donors. BCRA prohibited “soft money” contributions to the political parties in 2002. The courts have struck down much of BCRA, but this prohibition remains. In other words, individuals or organizations may give as much as they wish to super PACs but not to the political parties. This unusual preference for “outsiders” over “insiders” would end if Congress removed the soft money ban.



Last, but far from least, is the problem of electoral competition. Campaign finance regulation brings every member of Congress face‐​to‐​face with the problem of self‐​dealing — not only the self‐​dealing that the regulations are supposed to prevent but, more immediately, the self‐​dealing that is inherent in writing regulations not simply for oneself but for those who would challenge one’s power to write such regulations in the first place. Put simply: elected officials are writing the rules by which they get chosen for office, and it may not be a coincidence that many of those rules disproportionately harm challengers over incumbents. Unseating incumbents is very difficult, and campaign finance restrictions only make it harder. Even in the “revolution” of 1994, which changed control of the House of Representatives, 90 percent of incumbents were reelected. In the Tea Party wave of 2010, 85 percent of House members and 84 percent of senators were reelected. The 2010 Tea Party elections were the first time the House reelection rate dipped below 90 percent since 1992.



Campaign finance restrictions may not fully explain the lack of competition for incumbents in American politics. But those restrictions encumber entry into the electoral market and thus discourage credible challenges to incumbents. A challenger needs large sums to campaign for public office, especially at the federal level. He needs big money to overcome the manifest advantages of incumbency — name recognition, the power of office, the franking privilege, a knowledgeable staff, campaign experience, and, perhaps most important, easy access to the media. Current law limits the supply of campaign dollars: an individual can give no more than $2,700 to a candidate, and a political party or a political action committee can give no more than $5,000. In a free and open political system, challengers could find a few “deep pockets” to get them started, then build support from there, unrestrained by any restrictions save for the traditional prohibitions on vote selling and vote buying.



Although disclosure of campaign spending was upheld in _Citizens United_ , Congress should be wary of attempts to use onerous disclosure regimes as a backdoor to regulating speech. The Supreme Court has affirmed the right to anonymous speech ( _McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission_ ) and anonymous association ( _NAACP v. Alabama_ ), yet the precise contours of how far Congress or state legislatures can go in mandating disclosure are still unclear. Many lawmakers are trying to use that lack of clarity to hinder campaign spending.



In recent years, the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act (DISCLOSE Act) has been the most significant attempt to impose demanding disclosure requirements. But those requirements have few benefits, and they greatly encumber free speech. In its various forms, the DISCLOSE Act seeks to mandate disclosure of independent corporate spending to voters, citizens, and shareholders. Although the vast majority of election spending is already disclosed, lawmakers and pundits still rail against so‐​called “dark money” — a term that usually describes spending by 501(c)(4)s and 501(c)(6)s.



Given the prevalence of the term “dark money” in political rhetoric, one could be excused for thinking that most election‐​related spending is “dark.” Yet according to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 2014, “dark money” accounted for $175 million of the total $3.7 billion spent, or 4.7 percent. While the absolute amount of both disclosed and undisclosed independent spending has increased since 2000, “dark money” still represents a small part of election spending. The general increase in independent spending is likely due to the increased partisanship around politics and, in particular, around which party controls Congress and the presidency.



Disclosure advocates insist that voters “need to know” who is spending money in elections. This proposition is dubious in most circumstances. It’s hard to imagine a situation in which a voter would need to know who donated $400 or even $4,000 to cast an informed vote. For voters committed to a party or an ideology, such knowledge is irrelevant; for marginal voters, studies have found that such information has little effect.



But disclosure can have a large effect on encumbering political speech, particularly in an increasingly partisan and volatile political climate. In 2014, for example, former Mozilla chief executive and founder Brendan Eich resigned after it was revealed that he contributed $1,000 to an anti‐​gay‐​marriage group. It is hard enough to support an unpopular cause, say gay rights in 1980 or opposition to gay rights in 2016, without adding the burden of having the names and addresses of supporters publicly disclosed and available on a website. Politics can create enemies of friends, and people should not be forced by the government to disclose to their neighbors what causes they support.



Until the Supreme Court weighs in on the proper balance between voter information and donor privacy, lawmakers at all levels should resist new disclosure laws that provide little benefit to the electorate and do much harm to free speech. Lawmakers should also be wary that disclosure laws are often proposed for the implicit, and sometimes explicit, purpose of dissuading political engagement through public shaming and other actions. Valid disclosure laws should be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government interest, and they should not be justified by mere hand‐​waving reference to “voter information.”



Finally, in recent years, some have called on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to scrutinize election‐​related speech. When the IRS imposed onerous compliance requirements on conservative political groups, some evidence suggested that the agency had been pressured to scrutinize political speech. In 2013, the IRS proposed onerous new rules for 501(c)(4)s, which broadly defined “candidate‐​related political activity” in a way that could have threatened the continued existence of 501(c)(4)s. The IRS is not qualified to regulate political speech, and Congress should resist any future attempts to increase the IRS’s regulation of political groups. Similarly, many have proposed that the SEC should ensure that the political activities of publicly traded companies are disclosed to shareholders. Again, regulating political groups and political speech, if it is to be done at all, is the province of the Federal Election Commission, not the SEC. Congress should continue to block any attempt to involve the SEC in campaign finance.



Campaign finance has emerged as one of the most contentious issues of our time, and there is little indication that this will change. Both sides have coalesced around fundamentally irreconcilable visions of the First Amendment. Judicial nominees at the federal level should be heavily scrutinized on which version of the First Amendment they endorse.



On one side, campaign finance reform advocates view the First Amendment as empowering agencies and courts to make the “marketplace of ideas” more fair. On the other side are those who rightly resist any interpretation of the First Amendment that empowers rather than limits the government.



For 200 years, until _Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce_ , the Supreme Court viewed the First Amendment as limiting rather than granting government power. _Citizens United_ overruled _Austin_ and thus reestablished, in the words of Justice Antonin Scalia, “the central truth of the First Amendment: that government cannot be trusted to assure, through censorship, the ‘fairness’ of political debate.”



Today, many jurists and academics deny that central truth; they want the government to play an active role in regulating political debate for fairness. Yet there are no meaningful, objective standards by which an agency or a court could determine whether a political debate is fair, and any attempt to do so is sure to be imbued with bias. This is precisely why that interpretation of the First Amendment is not just wrong, it is dangerous. The “fairness” theory is not a modification of existing First Amendment doctrine, it is a fundamental shift away from over two centuries of liberalism, in the classical sense of the word. Congress should determine whether judicial nominees support that long liberal tradition of free and open politics and resist confirming those who do not.

"Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, readily conceded last week that there would be a “dead weight” cost to his policy of offering firms a £1,000 bonus for every employee recalled from furlough and kept in employment until the end of next January. That weight is the waste of rewarding firms for doing what they would have done anyway as the economy reopens. So it is good news, of a sort, for Sunak that some are too embarrassed to take the money. Primark was first out of the blocks at the weekend. The fashion retailer didn’t need a financial incentive to get 30,000 furloughed staff back in the shops and warehouses, so it would decline the kind offer of £30m of public money. Well played.  Primark’s honourable stanceunderlines the shockingly poor design of Sunak’s “job retention bonus” scheme. Yes, in a few cases, a £1,000-per-employee incentive may change the financial calculation for an employer, but one suspects the numbers will be tiny. Jim Harra, the chief executive of HMRC, grasped the point when he formally told the chancellor that the scheme, with a theoretical maximum payout of £9.4bn, did not offer “value for money”. If it’s too awkward for Sunak to plead with big companies to follow Primark’s example, someone should be put on the case. An energetic junior minister could save a billion or two here. Another day, another clothing retailer facing reports of pay abuses in its supply chain in Leicester. This time it was Quiz promising a “full review” of auditing processes after cases were found of workers being offered £3-£4 an hour to make garments for the label. Meanwhile, the mini-recovery in the share price of Boohoo, the retailer that sources 40% of its garments from Leicester, reversed. The shares fell 18%. Investors have understood that this affair will not go away quickly. Any doubt on that point was removed on Friday when Aberdeen Standard Investments called Boohoo’s board’s response to last week’s revelations “inadequate in scope, timeliness and gravity”. As with Boohoo, the Times’ report about Quiz involved work being passed on to subcontractors, with visibility of the supply chain being lost (or not sufficiently sought). This is the aspect that deters some rival retailers. If you are truly committed to knowing every detail of where and how your clothes are manufactured, they say, Leicester’s textile industry is not the place for you. The location is seen as too risky – it’s too hard to gain 100% confidence in the quality operators. Some Leicester refuseniks, though, also make a more cheerful point. If visibility and trust improved, they are not averse to moving some manufacturing back to the UK. Price gains from off-shoring production are becoming harder to achieve; quick turnaround times and closeness to customers now have increasing competitive appeal for mid-market labels, not just the likes of Boohoo. Rehabilitation of the reputation of the UK textiles industry is clearly not likely to happen quickly after the revelations of the past fortnight. But a move upmarket, and away from fast fashion, looks the only promising route. BlackRock’s conversion to sustainable investing came late. It was only in January this year that Larry Fink, the chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager, made the critical declaration that sustainability was “the strongest foundation for client portfolios going forward” – in other words, that being responsible can be financially good for you. There was still scepticism, however. Would BlackRock, even as it was ditching a few thermal coal companies from its actively- managed portfolios, use its immense voting power to upset the boards of environmental laggards? The only voting commitment sounded alarmingly weak: to be “increasingly disposed” to vote against boards. Well, the first post-epiphany results have arrived. BlackRock says in the past year it took “voting actions on climate issues” at 53 companies. That compares to with just six in the previous year. An eightfold increase is not quite as impressive as it may seem since most big European fund houses are still far more militant on voting. But it’s a start. If it signifies genuine change, keep pressing. BlackRock also placed a further 191 companies “on watch” on climate disclosures and policies, so there’s room to be more muscular."
"Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Let’s turn it over to Thomas Fuller, our San Francisco bureau chief, for today’s introduction. More than four decades ago California passed a landmark law protecting the state’s farmworkers from abuse and helping them to organize. But the recent resignation of the head of a board that oversees the implementation of the law highlights the extent to which organized labor among farmworkers has collapsed since the days of the pioneering labor leader Cesar Chavez. Chavez’s activism was instrumental in the creation of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975, the passage of which Gov. Jerry Brown described as a major accomplishment of his first stint as governor. In his recent resignation letter, the head of the board, William B. Gould IV, described the law as “irrelevant to farmworkers. ” He estimated that less than one percent of the agricultural work force is now represented by a union. As chairman of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, Mr. Gould was charged with overseeing the certification process of union elections. Yet Mr. Gould said virtually no workers came to the board during his tenure. “During the entire three years that I was chairman of the board there was only one petition for representation filed by a union in the state of California,” he said. Mr. Gould says a major factor for the decline of organized farm labor is the fear that undocumented workers have of dealing with the government. Around half of the Californian agricultural work force is in the country illegally. “There is not only no incentive to complain but there is no incentive to become involved with government in any way,” Mr. Gould said. California’s agricultural industry is bigger than ever. It produces roughly a third of all fruits and vegetables grown in the United States and has about a third of the nation’s farmworkers. Philip Martin, a specialist on organized farm labor, paints a less stark picture than Mr. Gould of the plight of farmworkers. Farmworker wages “have gone up significantly,” Mr. Martin said, and some workers have the benefit of voluntary agreements that growers sometimes enter with their suppliers. The average hourly wage of farmworkers in California is around $12, he said, above the state’s current minimum wage of $10. Mr. Martin, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Davis, says estimates on unionization rates among farmworkers in California are not very reliable because there are no government requirements to report them. But he says it is undeniable that unionization rates have plummeted from the heyday of union power in the late 1970s. “There’s not near the union activity that there used to be,” he said. Student groups at U. C. Berkeley had vowed to disrupt the scheduled appearance of a controversial,   speaker. And on Wednesday, as the speaker, Milo Yiannopoulos, an editor at Breitbart News, was set to appear, protesters delivered on the promise, setting fires and throwing objects at buildings. The police canceled the event before it could begin, and buildings on the campus were locked down for several hours. Mr. Yiannopoulos condemned the outcome. “One thing we do know for sure,” he said on Facebook, “the Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down. ” On Thursday morning President Trump responded on Twitter, appearing to defend Mr. Yiannopoulos and threaten the university’s funding: (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • What a diverse California says about the future of political strife in the rest of the United States.

"**A photo found in an Australian thrift shop has been traced back to its owner via an English family.**
The black and white snap dated ""1952, Luton"" was found in a purse bought in Capalaba on the outskirts of Brisbane by Peter Hughes' partner Lalen.
Gillian Keenan from Luton recognised her father in the photo after it was shared with a Luton Facebook group.
The image shows Mrs Keenan's father Reginald Fletcher on his wedding day with his father-in-law and an uncle.
Mrs Keenan's father is now aged 90 and still lives in Luton.
""He was really pleased to see it and we had a trip down memory lane,"" she said.
His suit, he told his daughter, had been from a ""50-bob tailor"" in the town - about Â£2.50 in today's money, not taking inflation into account.
The lost picture, which belonged to Mrs Keenan's Aunt Sally, prompted her to share a more formal image of her parent's wedding to corroborate the story.
In the photo and partially obscured, is Sally Hayden, who moved to Australia with her husband in the months after her brother's wedding.
Recently the Haydens moved house and it is thought the purse was among several items that ended up in the thrift shop.
Mrs Keenan said although she had kept in touch with Sally Hayden, it was ""wonderful"" to speak to her cousin Ross for the first time as a result of finding the picture.
Peter Hughes, 58, who lives in Capalaba, posted the lost photograph on Facebook after his partner Lalen discovered it having bought the purse.
He said he was ""quite surprised and quite interested"" by the image of the three men.
""I turned over it and saw Luton on the back and thought it must be from England,"" Mr Hughes said.
He put it on Facebook and someone originally from Bedfordshire added it on a group in Luton.
""It just struck a bone when I saw it. It's a real photo. Now someone's come forward from so far away, it's a really nice feeling.""

Share this...FacebookTwitterHere’s another compelling reason why we should all be hoping that the earth will warm and not cool over the coming decades. (After all, there is no way the temperature is going to stay stagnant).
The print edition of yesterday’s UK Daily Mail has a short report on an international study on the effects of temperature on death rates. The comprehensive study was conducted by the Dr. Antonio Gasparrini of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It examined 74 million deaths in 13 countries.
Also read it at Science Daily (Can’t link because I’m writing from a mobile device – just Google it).
The result, The Daily Mail writes:
7.71 per cent of the deaths were caused by non-optimal temperatures. Cold was responsible for 7.29 per cent of deaths, while 0.42% were attributable to heat, according to the study, published by the Lancet medical journal.”
In other words, deaths from cold were some 20 times than those from heat.
What is interesting is that the study found that most of the deaths occurred when the temperatures were “moderately hot and cold”. This may be due to people underestimating the “moderate” anomalies, and thus failing to take the corresponding precautions. On extremely hot or cold days, on the other hand, the level of awareness is heightened due to media hype, and so people tend to behave accordingly, i.e. drink more fluids, or really bundle up.
Cold is the last thing we need
The study tells us one thing: Cold is the last thing we want to see, and any warming needs to be welcome. Unfortunately recent temperature data and climate trends bode ill, as a number of distinguished scientists are forecasting cooling over the coming decades due to ocean and solar cycles swinging into their cool modes.
Given the results of the study, which are obvious to most normal thinking people, one would need to be a total moron, or just plain mean-spirited,  to be rooting for cooling.

"Researchers working in the field of climate change communications have, for many years, been confronted with the same puzzle: why, when there is widespread recognition of the importance of climate change, has there not been any sustained demand for action? In opinion polls, people said they cared about climate change, but compared with issues such as immigration, the economy and more recently in the UK, Brexit, they didn’t care that much. In the past year, however, we have witnessed a genuine shift – a growth in momentum which can be traced variously to the power of a unique Swedish schoolgirl, the social disruption of Extinction Rebellion, and a hard hitting David Attenborough documentary all building on the decades of work done by scientists, NGOs and activists. Public concern about climate change is at an all time high, a number of councils as well as the Scottish government are calling for a climate emergency to be declared, and the liberal media, most notably the Guardian and the BBC, are changing the language of climate to talk of crisis, emergency and catastrophe. But this is not a balanced shift across all of society. While researchers and the media often discuss political polarisation of climate attitudes, and more recently the generational divide, there is far less discussion of what might be described as climate’s class problem. One side of this is clear cut: climate change will disproportionately affect those in the most disadvantaged groups. The other is empirically trickier to pin down, not least because social class itself is subject to a range of different and disputed measures. And while, broadly speaking, climate engagement tends to increase with education and income, these variables are affected by a range of regional, socio-economic and political alignments, and are forever shifting.   In my own research, I have found correlations between regional media consumption and climate belief that cut across income-based groups in unpredictable ways. So, for example, readers of The Sun (a right-wing tabloid) showed much higher levels of scepticism than those loyal to the left-leaning Scottish Daily Record, but with no clear link between income and climate belief.  Maybe partly because of this, researchers have tended to focus on questions of identity and values rather than class (or race). But I and many others have a strong sense of this divide. The environmental movement has always had a middle class aura to it and, in spite of attempts to use the language of inclusivity, it has never quite lost this tag. In my research I have seen, among those in the lower economic groups, a marked tendency to use distancing terminology such as “middle class tree-huggers” and “green lobby”. This is fed by a mainstream media that positions environmentalism as the privilege of the wealthy who don’t need to worry about bread and butter issues – as one of my respondents noted, it feels like “fiddling while Rome burns”.  Engaging those in lower income groups is clearly a distinct challenge. In this respect, work I carried out with Chatham House on climate change and willingness to give up meat is enlightening. This research involved focus groups categorised by income across the UK, US, China and Brazil.  We found widespread collapse in public trust across all different groups in both the US and the UK. This extended beyond political actors to the range of voices which feed into public decision making – scientists with an agenda; economists who led us into the financial crisis; lawyers who let politicians off the hook and so on. The result is a real lack of faith in the political process, and a sense of a dysfunctional democracy. And while this crisis in trust was widespread and existed across all groups, the tendency was exaggerated among those in the lowest income groups – those who have been most impacted by decades of neoliberal policies.   Climate change, reliant on expert evidence, is to some degree impacted by this decline in trust. And this becomes more acute when it comes to the framing of solutions – in this case, eating less meat – where people were particularly aware of hypocrisy and the need for climate action to be fair. Who should be forced to eat less steak? And who has the authority and expertise to say so? We found a sense that solutions should not be imposed from on high without any consideration of the challenges of getting through everyday life.  In our focus groups there would be an initial bristle at the mention of measures which might increase the price of meat (of “nanny stateism”), but then fuller discussion of how lives are structured in ways which impose unhealthy diets. Eventually, almost all groups welcomed a meat tax, as long as they would have access to cheap, healthier alternatives which also benefited the planet.  Another example of more effective framing is politician Caroline Lucas’s “frequent flyer levy” which is rooted in the fact of flying is a middle-class addiction (with 15% of the UK population taking 70% of all flights). And this reframing of climate as about everyday fairness and social justice is embodied in the Green New Deal taking root in the US and all over the world. As US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said: “You want to tell people that their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist?”  This is about a fair and just transition to clean energy with prioritisation of public health, security, housing and jobs at the centre of it. Scotland has now set up a Just Transition Commission aimed at bringing about a transition which also promotes “social cohesion and equality”. This is the seed of a political reframing, which moves climate change from a side issue to one which is integrated into every discussion, every decision and concerns every group. It’s up to a future-thinking media to translate this new political discourse into messaging that reframes the climate action from an exclusive movement to one which is by and for everyone.

 _Wall Street Journal_ columnist William A. Galston says “the Great Decoupling of wages and benefits from productivity [is] the biggest economic story of the past 40 years.” Wow! The Biggest Economic Story of the past 40 years! Imagine that! I have been researching such data longer than 40 years yet this particular story is so old (and so wrong) I had almost forgotten about it.   
  
  
The alleged decoupling of growth of pay from productivity, as Robert Gordon explained in 2009, “compares apples with oranges, and then oranges with bananas.” Median wages for the whole economy were deflated by the consumer price index, which exaggerated inflation and understated real income growth. Rapidly growing health and retirement benefits were often excluded. These muddled measures of real pay, which also failed to adjust for changing household size or hours, were compared to productivity of the nonfarm business sector, not the whole economy. And real output was calculated using GDP deflators that showed much less inflation than the CPI. With those errors, one estimate for the income‐​productivity gap from 1979–2007 was 1.46 percentage points, but Gordon’s adjustments shrunk that to a negligible 0.16. He also noted that mean and median incomes grew at remarkably similar rates, suggesting inequality did not explain much.   
  
  
A 2013 study from the London School of Economics likewise found no significant gap between growth of compensation and productivity in the United States or UK (unlike the EU and Japan) if both measures are properly calculated with the same price index. The LSE study concluded that, “the debate around net decoupling in the UK and US is rather a distraction (it is actually more important in Continental Europe and Japan). Obtaining faster productivity growth is a highly desirable policy goal in the current climate of near recession as it will ultimately lead to faster wage growth and consumption.”   
  
  
Galston tells other stories, such as “mobility has stalled” — which is indefensible nonsense. His allusion to the “past 40 years,” appears based on a Pew Research paper’s pointless claim that the “middle class” constituted a smaller share of adults in 2011 than in the idyllic year of 1971. As Pew Research hesitantly revealed, that is mainly because millions of people moved _up_ — “the upper‐​income tier [earning more than double median income] rose to 20% of adults in 2011, up from 14% in 1971.”   
  
  
All this statistical fog is thin camouflage for Galston’s invitation to grant authoritarian politicians and bureaucrats the discretion to somehow “link the tax rates individual firms have to the compensation practices they adopt.” That may well be the worst economic policy idea of the past 40 years, trailing barely behind Nixon’s dictatorial price controls.

"Joe Biden has unveiled a new, more aggressive climate and jobs plan which advisers say he would take to Congress “immediately”, if elected president. The new proposal outlines $2tn for clean energy infrastructure and other climate solutions, to be spent as quickly as possible in the next four years, what would be the Democrat’s first term in office. Last year, he proposed $1.7tn in spending over 10 years.  “Addressing the economic crisis is going to be priority one for a President Biden,” a senior campaign official told reporters. “This will be the legislation he goes up to [Capitol Hill] immediately to get done. The reality is we will be facing a country that will be in dire need of these types of investments that are going to be made here.” Two crises are converging: a devastated economy and high unemployment that could drag on for years as the nation struggles to gain control of the coronavirus pandemic, and a rapidly closing window to significantly cut heat-trapping emissions and lead on global climate action. Biden unveiled the climate plan, the second part of his “Build Back Better” proposal, in remarks from Delaware on Tuesday afternoon. “When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is ‘hoax’,” Biden said, referring to Trump’s previous claims that the crisis is fake. “When I think about climate change, the word I think of is ‘jobs’.” In a detailed climate policy speech, Biden said his proposal would create a million jobs in electric vehicle manufacturing, a million in upgrading buildings and a quarter-million cleaning up after extractive industries. Biden said he would give Americans money back for switching to cleaner cars and making their homes more efficient. He said he was focusing on his first four years as president because “science tells us we have nine years before the damage is irreversible”. The new goals align Biden more closely with three primary opponents, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Jay Inslee. the Washington governor. They follow the recommendations of a unity taskforce of Sanders and Biden supporters that was co-chaired by the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who co-sponsored the Green New Deal. Biden staffers painted a picture of a modernized America with the “cleanest, safest, fastest rail system in the world”, the biggest electric vehicle manufacturing sector, 4m upgraded buildings and 1.5m new sustainable homes and public housing units. They pitched the spending as a jobs plan as much as a climate program. The blueprint aims for a clean electricity system including renewable power and nuclear energy by 2035. Biden would not ban fracking for natural gas, which would require an act of Congress. But he would prohibit new fracking on public lands. Gina McCarthy, the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator who is now president of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund, said the plan was “by a long shot – the most ambitious we have ever seen from any president in our nation’s history”. Labor unions and environmental justice communities would be central to climate efforts, campaign staffers said. Climate change hits low-income and communities of color hardest, a background document noted. Biden would create a national crisis strategy to ensure that government responses to disasters are equitable, start a taskforce to decrease climate risks for the most vulnerable, and establish an office of climate change and health equity. The faster timeline is meant to ensure that no future president can reverse climate gains, in the way Donald Trump’s administration has boosted fossil fuels. Trump plans to exit the Paris climate agreement but Biden has vowed to re-enter it and double down on US contributions. Much of Biden’s plan would require agreement from Congress. Gaining control of the Senate is critical. “He is confident he will be able to work with Congress to get something constructive done,” the senior campaign official said. “He is of course at the same time making sure that he is campaigning in every state needed to make sure that we win every Senate seat we possibly can to further that goal.” Another Biden official said the program would be funded by tax increases for corporations and “asking the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share”. The updated climate plan follows Biden’s announcement last week of a $700bn “buy American” proposal to revive US manufacturing. Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the youth-led Sunrise Movement, said Biden’s revised plan responds to many of the group’s previous criticisms by “dramatically increasing the scale and urgency of investments, filling in details on how he’d achieve environmental justice and create good union jobs, and promising immediate action — on day 1, in his first 100 days, in his first term, in the next decade — not just some far off goals”. Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley claimed Biden’s plan would kill 10m American energy industry jobs and called it a “socialist manifesto”."

But new CO2 reduction plans being drawn up by Germany’s Economics Ministry, headed by SPD chief Sigmar Gabriel, has the country’s mining, chemical and energy workers up in arms.

The planned protests further puts a German government in an increasingly awkward position as it attempts to appease both the powerful environmental groups, and the country’s influential industrial trade unions.
100,000 jobs at risk, “social blackouts”
Coal power plants supply approximately 45% of the country’s electricity demands. German online daily Die Welt here reports that the Economics Ministry has produced a concept paper calling for capping emissions of older coal plants, and subjecting excessive emissions to hefty fees.

The 125-year old IG BCE union claims the plan threatens 100,000 jobs – in regions where economies are already strained. “Ultimately the social blackout of entire regions threaten,” the IG BCE warn. It also says that scaling back coal power “puts an affordable and reliable power supply at risk“.
The IG BCE announces large demonstrations outside Chancellor Angela Merkel’s office in Berlin on April 25: The motto: “Enough, we oppose!”
“Unrealistic” figures
Die Welt writes that the IG BCE had investment bank Lazard check over the draft plan. Lazard found that it is based on “unrealistically high power prices” for the year 2020.The prices projected for 2020 by the government will in fact be much lower, and thus means the plan would result in 85 to 95 percent of the power plants being unprofitable. The cap would literally mean the end of Germany’s lignite-fired power plants.
IG BCE commenter Thomas Rohde writes he will surely be attending the demo, and comments:
For too long we have believed politicians that an affordable energy supply and good jobs were worth it. The gods of climate protection have blindly run and sacrificed the guarantors of prosperity and value creation at the altar of CO2 reductions, much to the joy of other EU and industrial countries.”

"The world’s food supply is imperiled by a climate crisis already upon us, and Joe Biden this week put forward an agenda to address it that’s as bold as you could hope from a man who actually intends to get elected.  This spring, prominent scientists warned that a multi-decade drought previously forecast for 2050 is already taking shape in the Great Plains and the south-west. The implications are enormous, from the tinder of California’s wine country to the giant cattle feedlots around the Panhandle that will run out of water within 20 years. Iowa climate and soil experts say we will have a difficult time growing corn, the world’s most-used crop, in 25 years. In this, the buckle of the Corn Belt, yields could suffer by a third or more. Extreme weather is scouring fields and washing away entire Iowa towns near the Missouri River. Farmers hawk the weather closer than anybody, and they know they need help to adapt. If we don’t change, we’re set for a food production crisis. Tom Vilsack, the former US secretary of agriculture, advised Biden on his rural climate action plan. “It all starts with the understanding that agriculture is key to getting a handle on climate change,” Vilsack, who was also previously governor of Iowa, told me Wednesday. “We’ve got to use our rural lands more effectively to get agriculture to net-zero carbon.” Agriculture is a leading contributor to climate change through petrochemical fertilizer over-application, CO2 emissions from ethanol plants, methane from livestock production, and soil degradation. Vilsack says the sector can be turned into a hero in the climate battle by paying farmers to prevent pollution and sequester carbon. “The idea is that we can’t regulate our way to net-zero. We have to incent farmers to do what they want to do and know how to do. You do that through increased conservation payments. And, you recognize that society has got a stake here, and that foundations and corporations should invest in paying farmers to sequester carbon. We need to create a carbon market that actually works,” Vilsack told us. The Biden plan raises the idea of a “voluntary” carbon market. That’s all he can do going into an election. Taxing energy brought out the yellow jackets in France. Taxing carbon emissions cannot be avoided following the election – volunteers will not create the necessary scale. But there are experiments underway with private-sector carbon trading schemes that are interesting pilots. While carrots are always better than sticks, at some point the US has to lead the world by taxing carbon emissions. We don’t have much time. Otherwise, Biden’s $2tn energy plan is comprehensive, bold and optimistic. It promises to revive struggling auto towns in the midwest by building a new fleet of electric vehicles (a road the industry is already on). Since most renewable energy projects require land, rural areas are positioned to win with a wave of investment in wind and solar that brings hi-tech jobs to little towns along country blacktop roads. I know, because I live four miles away from the largest wind complex in North America, in Storm Lake, Iowa. We could reap even more benefits if we could clear transmission and grid bottlenecks to get clean, low-cost windpower from north-west Iowa to Chicago. Biden addresses it with a smart-grid plan backed up by massive battery banks. Already, Iowa produces about half its power from wind. Even Texas loves wind energy. This is something around which conservatives and liberals can come together. Other important solutions are at hand – planting cover crops for fall and winter to hold soil, suck up nitrogen and sequester carbon; planting grass along rivers to prevent pollution; new feedstocks such as sweet sorghum or hemp for carbon-neutral biofuels production: and on and on. The Farm Bureau on the right and the National Farmers Union on the left agree. We can reduce pollution of the Gulf of Mexico, and offset much of our carbon footprint, by planting a third more grass and a third less corn. By enforcing anti-trust laws already on the books, huge food conglomerates that are burning down the Amazon rainforest can be brought to heel. Biden describes a civilian climate corps to help build conservation infrastructure, methane capture from livestock operations, and restoring public funding for research universities that were purchased over the years by Monsanto and the Koch brothers. This is not the greenest of platforms. But it’s plenty good for Governor Jay Inslee of Washington, who ran for President on the climate platform. Inslee said he was “thrilled” with the Biden framework and called it “visionary”. It’s an excellent start for agriculture and food security. It recognizes that our food system will kill us at the current rate, but we can adapt it for rural prosperity and global security. We can clean up our water, make land more resilient to impending heat and drought, and meet our food production demands while reversing a decades-long policy of disinvestment in rural America. Sustainable agriculture will also mean healthier food. Biden offers an ambitious start that is politically calibrated not to do him in – because if he doesn’t win, all the best ideas are but dust blowing over the Kansas plains on a hot July day.

"**Bonheur Malenga, a Congolese university student, found himself facing a dilemma one day last month about whether to purchase online data.**
""As I was hungry, I didn't know if I should buy food or get a 24-hour internet bundle,"" he told the BBC.
The 27-year-old, who is studying engineering, relies on his parents for financial support - but has been spending more than usual as he has been doing research online for his final-year dissertation.
He lives in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where 26% of average monthly income is spent on getting online using mobiles - the easiest way to access the internet here.
""I told myself that staying hungry for a day and a night wouldn't kill me. So, I just bought the internet bundle and slept on an empty stomach,"" he said.
Mr Malenga says many of his friends face the same dilemma.
DR Congo is classed as the most expensive country to get online in the world, according to the 2019 Affordability Report from the Alliance for Affordable Internet.
The organisation determines affordable internet as paying 2% or less of your average monthly income for 1GB of mobile broadband data.
On the other side of the country, more than 2,000km (about 1,240 miles) east of Kinshasa, Eric Kasinga remembers an embarrassing moment that happened to him a few years ago.
Like many young people living in the town of Bukavu, he had to go to a cybercafÃ© to get online. He was applying for a postgraduate course at a reputable university in The Netherlands.
""The internet was so slow that the whole application process ended up taking three hours instead of one,"" he says.
But he only had enough money to pay for an hour.
He explained the situation to the cybercafÃ© manager, hoping he would be allowed to bring the money later.
However, the manager started shouting curses at him, screaming: ""The internet is not for poor people.""
For payment, the manager pulled off the new shoes Mr Kasinga was wearing, forcing him to walk the long distance home barefoot.
""I felt terribly ashamed,"" he says.
The graduate, who now works for a conservation organisation, was never able to follow up on his university application. He did try to get his shoes back later that week, but the cybercafÃ© manager had already sold them.
""Nobody should have to experience this just for internet,"" he says.
DR Congo is the fourth-most populated country in Africa, two-thirds the size of western Europe and is rich in the minerals used to make smartphones.
Yet many of its citizens have a hard time accessing basic services such as proper healthcare, drinking water and electricity.
For them, accessing the internet, recognised by the UN as a human right in July 2016, is regarded as a luxury.
The Congolese Post and Telecommunications Regulation Authority (ARPTC) estimates that only 17% of population has online access.
Another recent report also points the growing digital gender gap. More than 33.8% of men compared to 22.6% of women in Africa have online access, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) said.
Kodjo Ndukuma, an expert on digital rights at Kinshasa's UniversitÃ© PÃ©dagogique Nationale (UPN), says there are three main reasons for the high costs of the internet.
**1\. Nobody knows exactly how much it should cost**
""The modelling of cost is done when you make calculations based on investments put in by a telecom company, the running cost and the number of subscribers,"" he says.
These calculations have been made for voice calls but no telecommunication company has done that for internet data, meaning the regulator cannot put a cap on prices.
""The lack of a clear ceiling gives companies freedom to fix whatever price they want,"" says Prof Kojdo.
**2\. A lack of competition**
The number of subscribers and the number of telecom firms has remained stagnant for many years - limiting competition.
""All it takes is for this small number of companies to agree on one thing and nobody can stop them,"" says Prof Kojdo.
He gave the example of April 2016 when all the Congolese telecommunication companies, bar one, agreed to increase the price of mobile data by 500%.
**3\. Over taxation**
""Telecommunication companies pay taxes on the national, provincial and sometimes local levels,"" says the professor.
""They just put it on the heads of subscribers.""

The government is facing pressure to intervene, following protests by a youth movement known as La Lucha.
Between March and October, the group, acting as a de facto consumer rights organisation, held 11 demonstrations across the country calling for internet data costs to be lowered.
""The regulatory authority told us in a meeting that there are legal limits as to how far they can interfere in the operations of telecom companies,"" said Bienvenu Matumo from La Lucha.
""Still, we want the government to do something instead of watching us being scammed.""
The information technology minister was the one who called on the regulator, La Lucha and the telecoms firms to meet and thrash out a solution - the government itself is not allowed by law to interfere.
But the first meeting failed to come up with concrete steps to reduce the costs or improve the quality of internet services.
For businesswoman Vanessa Baya any improvement on the current situation cannot come too soon.
She runs a marketing business and relies on the internet to reach her clients.
""The quality of the internet network is so unreliable that I have to switch between more than two different telecom operators in a single day,"" she says.
That means buying extra data bundles for each operator, sacrificing other needs. But this does not solve her problems as she is not able to shoulder the cost of her customers.
""Even if I get online and share the catalogue of products with clients, they rarely download it, fearing it may eat up all their data."""
"**The heads of some of the world's biggest tech companies have appeared before Washington lawmakers to defend their firms against claims they abuse their power to quash competitors.**
Amazon boss Jeff Bezos said the world ""needs large"" firms, while the heads of Facebook, Apple and Google argued their companies had spurred innovation.
The appearance comes as lawmakers consider tougher regulation and competition probes are under way.
Some critics want the firms broken up.
Democrats pressed the tech titans on competition issues, while Republicans were more concerned about how they managed information and whether they were marginalising conservative views.
Congressman David Cicilline, the Democrat leading the congressional committee holding the hearing, said a year-long investigation by lawmakers had showed the online platforms had ""wielded their power in destructive, harmful ways in order to expand"".
He said he was convinced the firms were monopolies and called for action.
""Some need to be broken up and all need to be properly regulated,"" he said at the end of more than five hours of testimony.
Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai of Google, and Tim Cook of Apple insisted they had done nothing illegal and stressed the American roots and values of their firms.
At the hearing, lawmakers accused Google of having stolen content created by smaller firms, like Yelp, in order to keep users on their own web pages.
Amazon's treatment of sellers on its site, Facebook's acquisition of competitors such as Instagram, and Apple's App store also drew attention.
Mr Cicilline said Amazon had an inherent conflict of interest, since it both hosts sellers and competes against them by offering similar products. Such practice has also come under scrutiny from European regulators.
""Amazon's dual role... is fundamentally anti-competitive and Congress must take action,"" he said.
However, some Republicans signalled they were not prepared to split up the firms or significantly overhaul US competition laws, with one committee member saying ""big is not inherently bad"".
Republican concerns focused on perceived political bias at the firms, which they accused of suppressing conservative views.
""I'll just cut to the chase - big tech is out to get conservatives,"" said Congressman Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio.
Four of the world's top technology company executives may have been testifying before the Judiciary Committee from a distance, but they were still caught in the middle of a political storm on Wednesday afternoon.
The stated purpose of the hearing was to address whether existing anti-trust laws provide sufficient regulation of transnational tech Goliaths. The reality, however, was that the proceedings - with each member of the committee receiving five minutes to speak - were more akin to a feeding frenzy, as corporate chiefs faced criticism from every direction
Democrats expressed concern that the companies were abusing their power by disadvantaging competitors or buying them out entirely. Republicans accused the witnesses of insufficient patriotism and being too cosy with the Chinese.
Both sides expressed outrage over how the companies managed speech and expression on their platforms. They didn't go far enough in removing hateful rhetoric and false information, Democrats said. They singled out conservatives for censorship, the Republicans countered.
Through it all, the witnesses thanked the questioners and took their lumps, perhaps confident that they could soon log off and get back to their work. While all the politicians seemed to agree that the big tech companies were a problem, their chances of arriving at any kind of solution seems unlikely.
Appearing by remote video, the executives defended their companies, saying their products helped smaller businesses and they remained vulnerable to competition from newcomers.
Apple boss Tim Cook said the business climate was ""so competitive I would describe it as a street fight for market share in the smartphone business"".
Mr Bezos, in his first appearance before Congress, denied that Amazon's multiple roles were a conflict of interest, but he admitted the firm was reviewing its handling of sales data from sellers on the site.
The company has been accused of using such information to launch its own version of hot-selling products.
Mr Bezos said Amazon rules forbid staff from looking at sales data from individual companies, but he conceded it was possible that employees had violated the policy.
""We are investigating that,"" he said.
In his prepared remarks, Mr Bezos said Amazon faced significant competition from firms such as Walmart and noted that the company lost money for years as it branched out into new areas.
""I love garage entrepreneurs - I was one. But, just like the world needs small companies, it also needs large ones. There are things small companies simply can't do,"" he said.
US President Donald Trump is a long-time critic of Amazon and threatened his own action on Twitter, writing: ""If Congress doesn't bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders.""
He also told reporters that White House officials would be watching the hearing closely.
""There's no question that what the big tech companies are doing is very bad,"" he said.
Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said ""storm clouds"" were building in Washington but he thought it was unlikely that Congress would come together on new legislation that would force tech companies to change.
""We think a legislative fix is the only one that creates a potential for limitations on these companies' ability to conduct business, whether that takes the form of higher taxes or new rules regarding market concentration,"" he wrote.
""Absent a legislative fix, we don't see meaningful change in regulation, although future acquisitions will most certainly be scrutinized and more difficult to close."""

 **Introduction**  
The Obama administration has asked Congress to reinstate trade promotion authority in hopes that it will enable passage of the Trans‐​Pacific Partnership (TPP), a trade agreement being negotiated by 12 countries in the Asia‐​Pacific region. Advocates of free trade generally support trade promotion authority, because it eases the passage of trade agreements through Congress by guaranteeing an up‐​or‐​down vote with no amendments. While trade promotion authority can be useful, the current political climate in Washington reduces its benefits, and the late stage of the TPP negotiations raises the risk that trade promotion authority will do more harm than good.



Free trade agreements are an important tool to improve U.S. trade policy, and “fast track” trade promotion authority has been helpful in securing the completion and passage of those agreements. But, contrary to the assertion of many trade advocates, trade promotion authority is not a necessary prerequisite to passing trade agreements.



Trade policy has become much more partisan than it was when fast track was invented 40 years ago.1 With Republicans controlling the House of Representatives and a Democrat in the White House, the TPP has excellent prospects for passage even without trade promotion authority.



While the benefits that stem from granting fast track are currently weak, the costs are still very real. In exchange for promising expedited procedures, Congress sets negotiating objectives in the trade promotion authority statute that the president is expected to adopt if he wants an agreement to receive fast track treatment. If the TPP negotiations are as far along as the administration claims, adding new negotiating objectives will delay or possibly even prevent completion of the agreement.



If trade promotion authority is to be useful in facilitating the TPP negotiations, it must subtract rather than add negotiating objectives. The TPP, as envisioned by U.S. negotiators, will push forward a lot of unpopular, new U.S. demands as a condition for access to the U.S. market. None of these “ambitious” goals—like stricter intellectual property enforcement, investment protections, and regulatory good governance—helps American consumers or furthers the goal of trade liberalization. They do, however, attract substantial political opposition at home and abroad.



Unless trade promotion authority is used to make the TPP a better agreement, there is little point in pursuing it now. The battle over trade promotion authority will likely involve a divisive debate about the value of trade in which support from individual members is bought with guarantees of protection or favor for special interests. Such a debate will surely occur again when Congress votes to pass a completed TPP agreement, so why have it twice? Unless trade promotion authority can be used to simplify the trade debate and improve trade agreements—to make them more about free trade—the American people will be better off without it.



 **What Is Trade Promotion Authority?**  
There are a lot of myths about what fast track is and how it works. A grant of trade promotion authority establishes an agreement between Congress and the president over how trade agreements should be negotiated and ratified. Both the president and Congress take on obligations. Congress agrees to hold an up‐​or‐​down vote on trade agreements submitted by the president within established time limits. In exchange for this promise, the president agrees to consult with congressional leaders throughout the negotiations and to adopt a variety of negotiating objectives dictated by Congress.2



After negotiations are completed, the “fast track” component of trade promotion authority kicks in. Under the 2002 Trade Promotion Act, the president was required to notify Congress 90 days before signing any agreement. Then the president would submit the agreement to each house of Congress in the form of a bill implementing the treaty’s obligations. The House and Senate then had a total of 90 days to pass the bill out of committee and hold a floor vote.3 During this time, no amendments could be attached to the bill, and Senate filibuster rules didn’t apply.



Trade promotion authority can be very helpful in securing ratification and implementation of trade agreements. By simplifying and streamlining the approval process, and by giving congressional leaders influence over the negotiations from the beginning, trade promotion authority greatly reduces the potential for unhelpful disruption by Congress after an agreement is completed. The procedural restrictions prevent the agreement from being picked apart by every member of Congress whose district is home to an uncompetitive business.



Indeed many proponents of trade promotion authority claim that fast track is necessary to get trade agreements through Congress, and with good reason. Trade historian Craig VanGrasstek notes that between 1789 and 1933, the president submitted 27 tariff reduction treaties to the Senate for ratification, and only five of those were approved.4 Most of those that did not pass died after the Senate simply refused to hold a vote on them. Trade promotion authority removes that possibility.



The benefits of trade promotion authority, however, come with a substantial cost. Congress generally sees trade promotion authority as a way not only to expedite the passage of trade agreements but also to influence their content.5 Any agreement that receives fast track treatment is expected to conform to demands imposed by Congress in the trade promotion authority statute.



The 2002 Trade Promotion Act, in particular, laid out extensive and detailed negotiating objectives. Topics covered in the objectives included investment protection, intellectual property laws, administrative law, labor law, and environmental protection.6 These objectives are mostly export‐​oriented and reflect the interests of certain U.S. business interests in foreign markets. Their inclusion may garner additional political support for the agreement, but they also attract opposition.



Most importantly, achieving these negotiating goals will not liberalize trade. Nevertheless, these non‐​trade issues are often the most politically contentious aspect of trade agreements. At the same time, they distract negotiators from the legitimate goal of lowering U.S. trade barriers and fighting protectionism.



 **Trade Promotion Authority Is Unnecessary**  
The conventional wisdom, among trade advocates and opponents alike, is that fast track is necessary to get agreements through Congress. But the most recent experiences with trade promotion authority following the Democratic takeover of the House of Representatives in 2007 aptly demonstrate how ineffective it can be. At the same time, trade policy has become increasingly partisan in recent decades so that trade promotion authority is now neither necessary nor sufficient to pass free trade agreements.



 **Partisan Congress**  
In theory, trade promotion authority works well to enable the president to pursue an ambitious trade policy despite a typically trade‐​skeptic Congress. The negotiating objectives Congress includes in trade promotion authority serve as politically necessary restrictions on the president’s power to open the U.S. market. According to conventional wisdom, accepting the need for a watered‐​down agreement in advance is the only way to avoid having an agreement rejected or delayed after years of difficult negotiations.



But support for and opposition to free trade agreements has become especially predictable and partisan over the last few decades. Indeed, the trade policy divide in Congress may be more partisan now than at any time since the 1920s, when protectionist Republicans imposed high tariffs that helped plunge the country into economic depression and war. Today, anti‐​trade sentiment has become quite powerful within the Democratic Party. The Republican Party, while certainly not dominated by free traders, is strongly committed to reciprocal liberalization through trade agreements.



The result of this dynamic is that trade agreements are passed largely along party lines, regardless of what’s in them. For example, the last time there was a Democrat in the White House and Republicans in charge of Congress, controversy over labor and environment issues prevented Congress from approving fast‐​track legislation for President Clinton in 1998 despite support from Republican leadership. But while Republicans opposed including strong labor and environment objectives in a grant of fast track authority to a Democratic president in 1998, they had no trouble approving three agreements in 2011 that included such provisions.



Democrats, on the other hand, have recently demonstrated their willingness to oppose agreements without strong labor and environment provisions, even if the agreements are consistent with agreed upon fast‐​track objectives. In 2007 when the Democratic Party took control of the House of Representatives, the new leadership reneged on the 2002 fast track grant and demanded that already‐​completed agreements be renegotiated to include stronger obligations on labor and the environment before holding a vote.7 Even then, three of the agreements weren’t taken up by Congress until Republicans took back the House four years later.



Ironically, securing trade promotion authority can end up being politically more difficult than passing trade agreements. In 1998 the House voted 243–180 against granting fast‐​track authority to President Clinton. One third of the Republican majority joined the bulk of the Democratic members to defeat the bill. In 2002 a Republican House and Democratic Senate approved trade promotion authority for President Bush. The House voted along partisan lines, but the administration had to lobby Democrats in the Senate to secure passage. The 2002 Trade Promotion Act passed the Senate 62–34, a closer margin than all but one of the free trade agreements submitted to Congress under that bill’s procedures.



The lesson we should learn from fast track’s recent history is that ideological and partisan differences may be more toxic to trade promotion authority than to gaining approval of completed agreements. While trade agreements offer concrete, measurable benefits, the debate over fast track takes place in the abstract.8 Trade promotion authority is an opportunity for members to score points with constituents and special interests without much consequence. Once a completed agreement is on the table, members of Congress will face much greater pressure to avoid making parochial demands.



There’s little purpose in having a divisive debate about trade policy now and then another one when the TPP is complete, especially when the agreement is likely to pass even without trade promotion authority.



 **President Obama’s Trade Politics**  
Adding to Congress’s predictability, President Obama’s tepid approach to trade policy also counsels against the need for trade promotion authority.



The president’s trade policy has been fully focused on promoting exports since the beginning of his first term. Rather than seeing increased exports as a way to gain political support for reducing barriers to imports, President Obama has used the promise of increased exports to gain political support for his presidency. Past presidents have certainly viewed trade in a similar way, but President Obama seems especially disinterested in expending political capital, even on major trade initiatives like the TPP.



In late October 2013, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman made the administration’s position clear when he expressed a desire for a trade promotion authority bill as soon as possible with “broad bipartisan support.“9 The administration has been lobbying for trade promotion authority, but there is little indication that they care what’s in it, leaving all the details to Congress.10



All in all, the president’s attitude toward trade promotion authority demonstrates a keener interest in trade politics than trade policy. That is, President Obama sees the trade policy debate and ongoing international negotiations as a tool for managing political constituencies, not as part of a genuine agenda to liberalize trade. There’s little reason to believe, therefore, that the president will negotiate a TPP agreement that lacks the support necessary to succeed even without trade promotion authority.



With this political dynamic at work in Washington, trade promotion authority is simply not as important as its supporters claim it to be. Republicans will vote for the TPP because it is a free trade agreement. Many Democrats will oppose it for the same reason, but partisanship and active lobbying from the White House will push plenty of them to support President Obama’s politically palatable signature trade initiative.



 **Now Is Not the Time**  
Not only is trade promotion authority not necessary, at this late stage in the TPP negotiations it is potentially quite harmful. By pushing its weight around now, Congress could reduce the quality of the TPP as a free trade agreement without alleviating the problems of delay and disruption that trade promotion authority is meant to address. Adding new negotiating objectives after years of diplomatic work poses the risk that U.S. negotiators will have to backtrack on their proposals, renege on promises of flexibility, or even ask to rework completed texts.



The TPP negotiations have been going on for over three years now, and the time for an ambitious fast track bill has long passed. Trade promotion authority works because it allows Congress to exert influence at an earlier, less‐​disruptive stage in the process. But with TPP negotiations entering their final stage, that benefit has all but disappeared.



This problem is most apparent in the debate over whether to include currency manipulation restrictions in the TPP. Dire warnings over the specter of misaligned currency have become a mantra for American protectionists and industries that compete with Asian imports. It appears quite likely at this point that any bill providing trade promotion authority will insist that the TPP and any other trade agreement include a provision addressing the use of monetary policy or other methods to promote exports through currency manipulation.



Numerous governments participating in the TPP negotiations have already taken a strong stance against the inclusion of any provision on currency, and the Obama administration is on record opposing the rules for that reason.11



Without the bounds of trade promotion authority, the president could negotiate an agreement free of currency manipulation rules. Most if not all of the Republicans that are demanding currency rules in the TPP, would vote in favor of the agreement either way. If action on currency is needed to secure enough Democratic votes in the Senate, the president, not encumbered by the mandatory objectives of trade promotion authority, would have more flexibility to assuage their concerns in a way that doesn’t jeopardize the quality and viability of the TPP.



 **Consider Alternatives: A Cleaner Trade Promotion Authority Bill**  
Supporters of the TPP in Washington have labeled the budding trade pact an ambitious, high‐​standards agreement for the 21st century.12 What this really means is that the TPP will push forward a lot of unpopular, new demands as the condition for access to the U.S. market. None of this “ambition” helps American consumers or furthers the goal of trade liberalization. It does, however, make achieving freer trade more difficult.



Opening up foreign markets for U.S. companies is an essential part of trade agreements—but only for political reasons. Lowering U.S. trade barriers is politically quite difficult because those barriers benefit specific industries and companies that will lobby hard to keep out foreign competition. By promising foreign market access in return for lowering U.S. barriers, trade agreements garner support from other business interests.



It’s a messy but practical way to reduce the harm caused by U.S. trade barriers to economic growth and consumer welfare. But this paradigm is endangered when policymakers begin to think that securing favorable market conditions abroad is their primary goal.



The TPP agreement seeks to bring this aberrational approach to perfection. Negotiators have been working on chapters that cover topics like intellectual property, regulatory coherence, labor laws, and environmental protection. Not all of these are new to free trade agreements, but they seem to be the administration’s primary focus in the TPP.



Trade promotion authority could be very useful if, rather than adding extraneous objectives, it instead insisted on their exclusion. A “clean” trade promotion authority bill that demanded “clean” trade agreements would do a lot to reduce friction in trade politics and speed the negotiations along significantly.



There is precedent for using trade promotion authority to rein in harmful presidential priorities. In 1998 congressional Republicans proposed fast track objectives on labor and environment that were less stringent than those already agreed to in NAFTA.13 The Democrats’ demands in 2007, though on the whole more onerous, did include instructions to limit intellectual property and investment rules.



Unfortunately, most often the debates surrounding trade promotion authority are about the value of trade generally or about the propriety of granting powers to the president. Either of those is a distraction from the valuable debate we could be having over what trade agreements ought to look like.



 **Leave Your Options Open but Pay Attention**  
Pursuing the TPP without trade promotion authority doesn’t mean ignoring Congress. Indeed, the president will need the support of congressional leaders with power over the legislative schedule if he is going to get the TPP through Congress. Trade promotion authority is one way to do that, but there are other less formal avenues.



Despite not having trade promotion authority, the Obama administration has been following many of its rules throughout the TPP negotiations. In particular, the president informed Congress before initiating negotiations with Mexico, Canada, and Japan after those countries joined the TPP talks, and negotiators even waited the requisite 90 days.14 He has not, however, provided the same level of consultations with key congressional members that would be required under trade promotion authority.



The administration should increase its interactions with key Senate and House committee members as the negotiations go forward. This will enable policymakers in both branches to work together toward reaching a completed TPP agreement that Congress will approve.



Taking this approach foregoes trade promotion authority’s promise that Congress won’t delay or disrupt the agreement after it is completed, but it also avoids legally binding negotiating objectives that could not only delay the agreement but reduce its value. Since fast track isn’t necessary to pass the agreement through the current Congress, the benefits of fast track do not outweigh the costs.



 **Conclusion**  
Many will argue that you need fast track to pass free trade agreements, but right now trade promotion authority is largely useless and unacceptably costly. Recent history with fast track shows that the obstacles to passing free trade agreements depend more on the partisan and ideological balance of Congress. Imposing Congress’s policy objectives into the negotiations at this stage won’t help get the TPP accomplished any sooner, and will surely reduce the value of the agreement as a vehicle to liberalize trade.



A clean fast track bill that reduces the role of controversial non‐​essential objectives in the TPP negotiations would do wonders for the U.S. trade agenda. Unfortunately, Congress seems poised to insist on making the TPP an even more “ambitious” agreement.



The president has options to get the TPP through Congress that don’t involve the risks that come with a formal grant of trade promotion authority. If he wants support for the TPP, President Obama should listen to congressional leaders, adapt his negotiating goals accordingly and then lobby Congress to pass the agreement once it’s completed.

There’s been much ink spilled the past few days over U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan’s defense of the Common Core, delivered as an obnoxious attack on white, suburban women. Proclaimed Duncan to a meeting of the Council of Chief State School Officers (one of the Core’s progenitors):   




It’s fascinating to me that some of the pushback is coming from, sort of, white suburban moms who — all of a sudden — their child isn’t as brilliant as they thought they were and their school isn’t quite as good as they thought they were, and that’s pretty scary.



Much of the uproar over Duncan’s attack has been over his injecting race and sex into the Common Core debate, and that certainly was unnecessary. But much more concerning to me – and indicative of the fundamental problem with federally driven national standardization – is the clear message sent by Duncan’s denunciation of Jane Suburbia: average Americans are either too dull or too blinkered to do what’s best for their kids. The masses _need_ their betters in government – politicians, bureaucrats – to control their lives.   
  
  
Alas, this has been a subtext of almost the entire defense of the Core. Every time supporters decide to smear opponents primarily as “misinformed” or “conspiracy theorists,” they imply that people who are fighting for control of what their children will learn are either too ignorant, or too goofy, to matter.   
  
  
Of course, there are some opponents who don’t get all the facts right about the Common Core, but supporters ignore that many of these people are just finding out about the Core. Unlike major Core supporters, many opponents – often parents and plain ol’ concerned citizens – haven’t been working on the Core for years. And even when opponents use such regretably over‐​the‐​top rhetoric as calling the Common Core “Commie Core,” they are ultimately making a legitimate point: the federally driven Core is intended to make the learning outcomes of all public schools the same – “common” is in the name, for crying out loud! – and in so doing, nationalize learning. At the very least, that’s not a move in the libertarian direction.   




Every once in a while, Core supporters will openly air their basic distrust of average Americans. If you go to the 53:10 mark of our Common Core “Great Debate,” you’ll catch just such an admission by Chester Finn, president of the Core‐​championing Thomas B. Fordham Institute. In response to an explanation of how free markets enable average people to smartly consume things about which they are not experts, Finn declares that most parents won’t do even easy work to make informed choices. Then he asks, “is that a way to run a society?”   
  
  
And there it is: In the end, Common Core, and all the government power behind it, is ultimately about experts running society rather than letting free people govern themselves. Why? Because parents – “the people” – are either thought incapable, or unwilling, of caring for their children themselves.   
  
  
This attitude if fundamentally at odds with maintaining a free society. It declares that government must control what children learn, and in so doing gives government – not free people – the power over what the next generation of Americans will think. This is not to say that the Common Core is intended to inculcate values and attitudes – most supporters probably just want to better furnish skills – but it will nevertheless couple power over what the schools teach with an attitude that is fundamentally corrupting: I know what is best, and must make you do it. And if your betters think you can’t be trusted to teach your child about something as unthreatening as the ABCs, imagine what they may eventually require – or forbid – in teaching about religion, or guns, or climate change?   
  
  
As has been the case in the past, Secretary Duncan has actually done Common Core opponents a huge favor in an effort to take them down. But this may be his most important contribution yet, revealing the supremely threatening contempt in which he seems to hold the average parent, and which drives the Common Core.

"**YouTube has banned some prominent white supremacist channels as internet companies face a backlash over racist content.**
The Google-owned video platform said the channels had violated its policies that prohibit hate speech.
In recent days social media companies have been been boycotted by a number of major advertisers.
On Monday Ford joined a growing list of global brands that are pausing social media advertising during July.
In a statement YouTube said: âWe have strict policies prohibiting hate speech on YouTube, and terminate any channel that repeatedly or egregiously violates those policies.â
""After updating our guidelines to better address supremacist content, we saw a 5x spike in video removals and have terminated over 25,000 channels for violating our hate speech policies,â it added.
The channels that have been banned include some of the internet's most high-profile far-right commentators:
On Twitter Mr Molyneux described his channel's suspension as an ""egregious error"".
Also on Twitter, Mr Spencer said that he would appeal the decision and called the suspension a ""systemic coordinated effort.""
Separately, Amazon's live video streaming site, Twitch has temporarily banned US President Donald Trump, citing âhateful conductâ in his posts.
The company pointed to comments made at two rallies for the suspension.
At a 2016 campaign rally, which was recently rebroadcast on Twitch, Mr Trump said that Mexico was sending over its bad actors, such as rapists or drug dealers.
It also highlighted the president's rally in Tulsa earlier this month, at which he told a fictional story about a home invasion by a ""tough hombre"".
Meanwhile, social media site Reddit has shut down r/The_Donald, a forum which has long been a popular online home for Donald Trump supporters, saying that it violated the platform's hate speech rules.
Also on Monday, carmaker Ford became one of the latest global brands to announce that it would halt social media advertising spending for the month of July.
It joins other household names, including Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Diageo and Unilever, that have said that they will suspend advertising from some social media platforms in response to hate speech.
The announcements follow the launch earlier this month of the Stop Hate For Profit campaign, which described itself as a ""response to Facebook's long history of allowing racist, violent and verifiably false content to run rampant on its platform"".
Responding to the campaign Facebook said: ""We're taking steps to review our policies, ensure diversity and transparency when making decisions on how we apply our policies, and advance racial justice and voter engagement on our platform."""

Share this...FacebookTwitterAccording to the online Der Spiegel, northern Holland has been hit by “a widespread blackout” since earlier this morning.
The flagship German news magazine writes that major infrastructure, such as the capital Amsterdam and its international airport Schiphol and rail system, have been severely impacted.” Spiegel cites a report from Holland’s daily “AD” (formerly the “Algemeen Dagblad”.
The ad.nl site itself reports the power failure was caused by a fault at a high-voltage station in Diemen.”The station is one that handles 380,000 volts.” This would likely mean that its part of the power transmission system. 
According to Spiegel (my emphasis):
The ‘AD’ newspaper reports that there was possibly an explosion at the station. According to Reuters news agency, grid operator Tennet attributed the outage to an overload of the power grid.”
The Dutch news site reports that fire departments and police officers have been mobilized to free people from stopped elevators and to beef up security in and around Amsterdam.

According to the reports, a Tennet spokesman says that power is being restored slowly and expects it to be in full service soon.
The question that remains unanswered is why the station exploded and why there was a “power grid overload”, as grid operator Tennet reported. Looking at neighboring German wind power feed in, we see there was a modest 4-gigawatt input surge of wind energy occurring early this morning between 3 and 4 a.m. That’s like four regular power plants coming online, or 1000 large wind turbines. But such fluctuations are becoming routine, and so it is probably unrelated.

(NOTE: I’m traveling today, and thus I’m posting this article from The Hockey Schtick as it deserves attention and discussion. At 10AM EDT, an announcement about a new skeptic publication in Nature Climate Change  will follow this article – Anthony)
A commentary published April 25th in Nature Climate Change concludes on the basis of a new Southern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction that estimates of climate sensitivity to CO2 are lower than previously believed. 

 According to the author,
“If the new reconstruction of Southern Hemisphere temperature is accurate, then estimates of climate sensitivity — the response of global temperature change to a given amount of external radiative forcing [mostly from CO2] — may be lower than those calculated based solely on Northern Hemisphere reconstructions10. 

Indeed, instrumental temperature data suggest that warming in the Northern Hemisphere has been greater than that observed in the Southern Hemisphere over the past two decades (Fig. 1c) — a feature reproduced in the current suite of climate models11. Therefore, this hemispheric asymmetry may be a fundamental feature of the climate system’s response to a change in radiative forcing12, whereby the ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere acts as a buffer of sorts to global temperature change on decadal to centennial timescales. On the other hand, Neukom et al. propose that divergent hemispheric temperatures arise from strong natural climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere, and have been a constant feature of the past millennium.” 
“Given the new information now available from the Southern Hemisphere, climate scientists must consider a larger role for natural climate variability in contributing to global temperature changes over the past millennium. While the new reconstruction brings strong additional support to the phrase ‘anthropogenic global warming’, it also highlights the limits of our current ability to understand, and predict, global temperature variations from decade to decade.”
The new Southern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction of Neukom et al referred to in this commentary shows the globe is only about 0.25C warmer than during the Medieval Warm Period a millennium ago, and that’s only by ex-post elimination of temperature proxies that didn’t have a hockey stick shape, as has been noted by Steve McIntyre and others. 

Palaeoclimate: A southern misfit

Kim M. Cobb


Nature Climate Change

 4, 328–329  (2014)  doi:10.1038/nclimate2219

Published online 25 April 2014






Temperature reconstructions of the past millennium rely heavily on Northern Hemisphere data. Now a Southern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction is available and sheds light on the complexity of the interhemispheric temperature relationship.







For far too long the climate science community has grappled with an inconvenient truth: the vast majority of the datasets used to constrain temperature trends of the recent past come from the Northern Hemisphere. Over a dozen reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere temperature spanning the past millennium exist and have played a critical role in distinguishing natural from anthropogenic climate change. However, the extent to which recent temperature variations in the Northern Hemisphere resemble those in the Southern Hemisphere remains unclear. Such information is critical to a complete understanding of the mechanisms of global, rather than hemispheric, climate change. Writing in Nature Climate Change, Raphael Neukom and co-authors1 present a new, millennium-long reconstruction of Southern Hemisphere temperature by combining information from a wide variety of palaeoclimate sources. Although the new reconstruction resembles the Northern Hemisphere reconstructions in some key aspects — the anomalous nature of twentieth century warming being one of them — it also suggests that temperatures in the two hemispheres may have differed more than they have agreed over the past millennium.
The best-dated, highest-resolution records of past climate variability rarely extend beyond the past millennium, making this time period an important test bed for quantitative comparisons between climate field reconstructions and numerical climate model simulations of past climate2, 3. Yearly temperature can be reconstructed from archives, such as corals, ice cores, tree rings, lake sediments and cave stalagmites, by calibrating their geochemical or physical signals against the instrumental record of climate, where they overlap over the past century. In this regard, extremely poor data coverage for Southern Hemisphere ocean temperature observations makes this calibration more difficult (Fig. 1). Scientists use a variety of advanced statistical techniques to extract the shared signals across a given network of palaeoclimate records. The uncertainties associated with reconstructed temperature estimates inevitably increase further back in time, as the number of available records decreases, but can be quantified using a variety of approaches.

Figure 1: Instrumental temperature observations over the twentieth century.

One of the first such reconstructions was the so-called hockey stick, published by Mann et al. in 19994. As a reconstruction of Northern Hemisphere temperature spanning the past millennium, the hockey stick graph reflected a long-term cooling into the seventeenth century, the stick, followed by a sharp warming that began in the late nineteenth century, the blade. Multiple teams of scientists have subsequently generated dozens of alternative Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions, each using slightly different methods and data networks5. Climate model simulations that include natural forcings from volcanic eruptions and solar variability, as well as anthropogenic forcings such as greenhouse gases, reproduce many of the key features seen in the collection of Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstructions, within the combined uncertainties of the forcings and the reconstructions5. Such features include multi-year, hemispheric-scale cooling associated with large volcanic eruptions, as well as pronounced warming over the industrial era. The high level of data–model agreement suggests that scientists have a good grasp of the dominant mechanisms of climate change on decadal to centennial timescales, and that such mechanisms are fairly well represented in the current suite of climate models used to project future temperature.
[I beg to differ:]


However, the new reconstruction of Southern Hemisphere temperature1 suggests that the climate model simulations of past climate systematically underestimate the magnitude of natural climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere. At first glance, the reconstruction contains the same basic features of the Northern Hemisphere family of reconstructions — a centuries-long cooling into the seventeenth century, and a twentieth-century warming of unprecedented duration and magnitude. But a close comparison between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere reconstructions reveals many intervals when the two series diverge for decades at a time. Notably, some of these differences occur following large volcanic eruptions, when the Northern Hemisphere cools significantly but the Southern Hemisphere does not, at least according to the new reconstruction1. The fact that many of these differences occur within the past 400 years, when the data networks from both hemispheres are most robust, makes it less likely that such temperature differences are artifacts of poor data coverage. That said, it is possible that small but cumulative age errors in single palaeoclimate records may smear out interannual variability in large-scale temperature reconstructions6, 7 — currently the topic of vigorous debate8, 9.
If the new reconstruction of Southern Hemisphere temperature is accurate, then estimates of climate sensitivity — the response of global temperature change to a given amount of external radiative forcing — may be lower than those calculated based solely on Northern Hemisphere reconstructions10. Indeed, instrumental temperature data suggest that warming in the Northern Hemisphere has been greater than that observed in the Southern Hemisphere over the past two decades (Fig. 1c) — a feature reproduced in the current suite of climate models11. Therefore, this hemispheric asymmetry may be a fundamental feature of the climate system’s response to a change in radiative forcing12, whereby the ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere acts as a buffer of sorts to global temperature change on decadal to centennial timescales. On the other hand, Neukom et al. propose that divergent hemispheric temperatures arise from strong natural climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere, and have been a constant feature of the past millennium.
Given the new information now available from the Southern Hemisphere, climate scientists must consider a larger role for natural climate variability in contributing to global temperature changes over the past millennium. While the new reconstruction brings strong additional support to the phrase ‘anthropogenic global warming’, it also highlights the limits of our current ability to understand, and predict, global temperature variations from decade to decade. In other words, global temperatures will warm appreciably by 2100, but the road may be bumpy and full of surprises.

For a quarter century Republicans in American politics have broadly campaigned on a promise of reducing the volume and cost of litigation. At first glance, it might seem that the rise of President-elect Donald Trump might signal a discarding or even a reversal of this position. As a businessman, Trump has been an intensive, sometimes zealous litigant; unlike earlier GOP candidates he has said little about lawsuit reform on the campaign trail; and some of what he has said, especially his instantly famous remarks about ""opening up"" libel law to allow more damage suits against the press, is in tension with the goal of a less costly and more predictable legal system.   
  
At the same time, there are reasons to believe that a Trump administration will maintain considerable continuity with the positions of earlier GOP administrations as well as of Congressional Republicans. Here are some of those reasons.   
  
* _Both sides of the ""_ v _.""_ Trump has been in court frequently as plaintiff and defendant alike. While he may be nobody's idea of a critic of litigiousness, there is little reason to believe that his instincts about the legal system are systematically pro-plaintiff or pro-trial-lawyer in the manner of some Capitol Hill Democrats. 



* _Much of the national litigation reform agenda is now negative_. Some of the biggest priorities in the short term are simply to block or pull back destructive federal initiatives that the Obama administration pushed hard, including proposals to ban pre-dispute arbitration in consumer and labor settings in favor of litigation; proposals to extend overtime rules deep into the white-collar workforce, with wage-and-hour class actions inevitably to follow, and the idea of interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act to require websites and online services to be made accessible to disabled users, on pain of freelance lawsuits. Trump has signaled that his administration will be skeptical of grandiose regulation, and by knocking out rules of this sort he would also knock out much prospective litigation.   
  
To be sure, some litigation issues narrowly related to trade and immigrant employment might see a reset. And because Trump may be more open than most GOP presidents to cutting deals with organized labor, it is possible he will seek new solutions on issues like compensation for occupational illness arising from asbestos and other long-term exposures.   
  
* _Social reform litigation_. A Hillary Clinton administration would have been likely to cheer on big cities like Miami in ""disparate impact"" litigation seeking massive damages from banks for lending too freely (or too stingily; the theories vary) on mortgages and construction in urban neighborhoods. Whatever else is uncertain about a Trump administration, it seems unlikely that its instincts are to put real estate development at the mercy of redistributive social justice campaigns. And while Clinton campaigned on a promise to reopen the gun-control-through-lawsuits campaign by repealing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), that idea is now gone.   
  
* _On libel law_. As I and others have pointed out, our system doesn't give the President much of a say in libel law, which consists mostly of state tort law bounded by constitutional law as interpreted by the Supreme Court in cases like _New York Times_ v. _Sullivan_. Some earlier presidents (as well as some noted Republican-appointed jurists) have favored broader rights for plaintiffs to recover, but there is little evidence that the Supreme Court is on the cusp of any major reconsiderations here. One may also doubt that Trump in office will really make this a make-or-break litmus test for appointees knowing that it would limit his choice of politically appealing nominees and that a chipping away of _Times_ v. _Sullivan_ would in any case probably take many years.   
  
* _Progress on litigation reform does not depend on White House leadership_. Most positive change in this area has come from a combination of state legislatures and the courts themselves through judicially driven improvements in doctrine and procedure, especially via the U.S. Supreme Court ( _Daubert_ , _Iqbal_ / _Twombly_ , _Dukes_ , etc.) With occasional exceptions, as with securities litigation and class action reform, the U.S. Congress has not achieved much in this area, in part because our system of federalism places real limits on wholesale displacement of state court authority by federal.   
  
All of these predictions depend greatly on appointments; Trump is known above all for his capacity to surprise. But on an issue as important to the nation's economic climate as this, don't bet on President Trump to break with the near-uniform sentiment of the business community.

Not so much fanfare now, since leaks pretty much revealed earlier that it’s alarmism on steroids. The always dependably worrisome Seth Borenstein, AP’s science reporter, sums up the alarmism quite well with this tweet:

The Working Group II contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report considers the vulnerability and exposure of human and natural systems, the observed impacts and future risks of climate change, and the potential for and limits to adaptation. The chapters of the report assess risks and opportunities for societies, economies, and ecosystems around the world.
=============================================================
Headline Statements from the Summary for Policymakers *
Observed Changes in the Climate System


Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850. In the Northern Hemisphere, 1983–2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years (medium confidence).
Ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for more than 90% of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 (high confidence). It is virtually certain that the upper ocean (0–700 m) warmed from 1971 to 2010, and it likely warmed between the 1870s and 1971.
Over the last two decades, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass, glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide, and Arctic sea ice and Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover have continued to decrease in extent (high confidence).
The rate of sea level rise since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia
(high confidence). Over the period 1901 to 2010, global mean sea level rose by 0.19 [0.17 to 0.21] m.
The atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide have increased to levels unprecedented in at least the last 800,000 years. Carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by 40% since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions and secondarily from net land use change emissions. The ocean has absorbed about 30% of the emitted anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification.
Drivers of Climate Change

Understanding the Climate System and its Recent Changes

Climate models have improved since the AR4. Models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions (very high confidence).
Observational and model studies of temperature change, climate feedbacks and changes in the Earth’s energy budget together provide confidence in the magnitude of global warming in response to past and future forcing.
Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes. This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4. It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.
Future Global and Regional Climate Change

Global surface temperature change for the end of the 21st century is likely to exceed 1.5°C relative to 1850 to 1900 for all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. It is likely to exceed 2°C for RCP6.0 and RCP8.5, and more likely than not to exceed 2°C for RCP4.5. Warming will continue beyond 2100 under all RCP scenarios except RCP2.6. Warming will continue to exhibit interannual-to-decadal variability and will not be regionally uniform.
Changes in the global water cycle in response to the warming over the 21st century will not be uniform. The contrast in precipitation between wet and dry regions and between wet and dry seasons will increase, although there may be regional exceptions.
The global ocean will continue to warm during the 21st century. Heat will penetrate from the surface to the deep ocean and affect ocean circulation.
It is very likely that the Arctic sea ice cover will continue to shrink and thin and that Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover will decrease during the 21st century as global mean surface temperature rises. Global glacier volume will further decrease.
Global mean sea level will continue to rise during the 21st century. Under all RCP scenarios, the rate of sea level rise will very likely exceed that observed during 1971 to 2010 due to increased ocean warming and increased loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets.
Climate change will affect carbon cycle processes in a way that will exacerbate the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere (high confidence). Further uptake of carbon by the ocean will increase ocean acidification.
Cumulative emissions of CO2 largely determine global mean surface warming by the late 21st century and beyond. Most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of CO2 are stopped. This represents a substantial multi-century climate change commitment created by past, present and future emissions of CO2.

"I’m up late at night worrying that my baby brothers may die from global warming and other threats to humanity – please can you put my mind at rest? – Sophie, aged 17, East Sussex, UK Dear Sophie, Thank you for asking this really important question. I know from my work as a psychotherapist 
and with the Climate Psychology Alliance that lots of other young people are worrying about global warming and the climate crisis, too. There’s even a term for it: “eco-anxiety”.  I know that may not be much comfort, but it’s important to remember when you are worrying about something – especially something as huge as climate change – that you are not the only one feeling this way. So, my first piece of advice to you is to carry on doing what you have done here – do not keep your worries to yourself: talk with people about this, because sharing worries does help to make them a little better.  If you are not sure who to talk to then maybe start by listening to these podcasts by young people talking about how they coped with their eco-anxiety, and there are lots of good blogs and advice online that can help as well. I also want to say that I am really impressed by what a caring big sister you are. You are worrying about your baby brothers but do not say that you are worrying so much about yourself. They are lucky to have such a loving and protective big sister as you.  Our loving relationships with family and friends are important to remember when we’re worrying about things. Make sure that you ask others to look after you sometimes, then you can look after them in return when they need it – that always helps. Eco-anxiety is being felt more and more by people as they “wake up” to the climate and ecological problems that humanity is facing.  But it is not just anxiety: people also experience feelings of grief, anger, guilt, fear, shame and panic – sometimes all in one day. This can be confusing, and create even more anxiety.  Sometimes, we worry about our feelings and tell ourselves that we should not be feeling them (or other people say this to us). But it’s really important to remember that whatever feelings you’re having – even if they’re not nice to feel – are okay, you’re not going crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. Your fears are a really healthy response to what is going on in the world.  I Need To Know is a series by The Conversation, which gives teenagers the chance to have their questions about the world answered by experts. Do not be self-critical, be kind to yourself and be proud – because these feelings show how much you care about your brothers, and the state of the world. That’s why I sometimes call it “eco-awareness” or “eco-empathy”, rather than eco-anxiety.  One of the best ways to deal with this anxiety is to take some action, so that we do not feel powerless and helpless. I suggest that you join a group that is organising discussions or taking action to help protect the environment.  The school strike for climate groups are very supportive, but you could also suggest to your friends or classmates that you get together to talk about these things – maybe with a counsellor or teacher or another adult, or maybe on your own.  Between you, I am sure you can support each other and discuss how you can take positive action to use these anxieties and worries to make yourselves feel more powerful in the world. These things can start small, but they do make a huge difference to us all. These worries can be put to good use – and that’s often the best way to put your mind to rest. Also – when you feel anxiety, it might sound silly, but remember to breathe. We often hold our breath when we are anxious, and that makes it much worse. Here is a list of things I suggest to people to remember when they feel anxious:  The reason I have focused on how you can cope with your worries – rather than addressing your concerns about your baby brothers – is that we cannot promise that everything will be okay in the future. But what we can try do is make sure that you, me and everyone else is emotionally resilient enough to cope with whatever happens.  That means that we have to be good at listening to our feelings, be good at listening to other people too. We have to be kind to ourselves, to cope with a mix of feelings, to have empathy for other people and also ourselves, to be creative and also to be able to think when we are scared. We also have to have a balance between thinking about worrying things, and also thinking about the good things that are around – these are just as important. So while I can’t promise you that everything will be okay, I can promise that lots of people – including parents, psychotherapists and school strikers – will be working very hard and taking action to help people deal with things. And that means learning to build this emotional strength, together.  Then, in the future (whatever that looks like) you can teach these lessons to your baby brothers and help them deal with their fears. So, you will be helping them by helping yourself. That is the most important thing you can do to take care of them, and yourself, at the moment.

The Greens like to hector us over climate change by insisting “the science is settled”. However, they steadfastly refuse to follow the science with regard to genetic modification.



Peter Griffin writes:



 **The Green Party has long had a tenuous relationship with science**. 



The low point came in 2014, when [Green MP Steffan Browning ](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/10700186/MP-loses-portfolio-over-Ebola-petition)[signed ](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/10700186/MP-loses-portfolio-over-Ebola-petition)[a petition](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/10700186/MP-loses-portfolio-over-Ebola-petition) calling for the World Health Organisation to use homoeopathic remedies to tackle Ebola in West Africa, a move he later admitted was “probably pretty unwise”.



Now that Green MPs are ministers, the pseudoscience has been reined in and the best evidence available from the IPCC and other sources informs their policies on climate change.



But, as a group of young scientists pointed out in [an open letter to the Greens last week](http://thespinoff.co.nz/science/29-10-2019/genetic-modification-open-letter-green-party-young-scientists/), ideology rules the Party’s position on genetic modification.



“We believe that **GM based research could be decisive in our efforts to reduce New Zealand and global climate emissions as well as partially mitigating some of the impacts of climate change** ,” wrote the 155 biology and environmental science PhD and Masters students. 



Which is a fair point. Ironically GM is the best option we have to mitigate climate change, yet they refuse to touch what is ‘third rail’ for them.



The Greens are opposed to anything but tightly controlled GM lab experiments. That goes for genetically modifying pasture grasses to reduce emissions. It goes for using GM technologies such as gene drives to tackle our invasive pests.



[Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage has ruled them out](http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/109860790/conservation-minister-rules-out-genetic-modification-in-fight-against-predators) of the Government’s Predator Free 2050 plan. There were signs that climate change minister James Shaw was leading a re-think of his party’s position.



When [asked by TVNZ in March](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/government-led-science-genetic-modification-climate-minister?variant=tb_v_2) whether he’d support the use of GM technologies to combat climate change he said: “I want to see what the science says about that and what the science ethics committee say about that. I would be led by the science on that.”



But two weeks ago, when asked about it in Parliament, Shaw toed the party line. We have to think of our GM-free brand, he said. There are non-GM solutions that will do the job.



Well, the science says that GM has huge potential to reduce emissions through agricultural efficiency, carbon sequestration, and alternative protein production.



Our young scientists know this. Shaw knows this.



But he is held captive by party members who want to cherry-pick the science to suit their ideological agenda.



The Greens should embrace the science on GM as after all absolutely none of their scare-mongering over GM has ever remotely come to pass. The science regarding GM certainly has a far better and accurate record than the pseudo-science of climate change.



They need to match their actions on climate change with a more sensible approach to GM. Their weasel words need to be called out.

Share this...FacebookTwitterMost readers here know Joe Bastardi, the veteran meteorologist at Weatherbell who has a knack of getting his longer term seasonal forecasts correct far more often than not. In a reader comment he replies to warmists’ claims on ocean cycles, particularly to David Appell. I’ve upgraded his comment (with slight editing) as a post.
Question for David A: Is NCEP now a member of the vast denier conspiracy with their much more finely tuned grid that measures global temperature? Last year since the PDO decadal flip. Notice what happens after the warm ENSO event. With the AMO now turning cold, just where do you think temperatures will go after this ENSO event? But I am curious, has NCEP suddenly become a denier in the last 10 years? http://models.weatherbell.com/climate/cfsr_t2m_2005.png
The answer will be given to us in the next 20 years. I offered this several times on national TV over 5 years ago, simply watch the temperatures as the oceans complete their cycle, WELL DOCUMENTED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS A TRACK RECORD FORECASTING THE WARMING, AND RESULTANT HURRICANE PICK UP BACK IN THE 1970S, DR WILLIAM GRAY: http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Includes/Documents/Publications/gray2012.pdf 
And why doesn’t total global sea ice make a difference? It certainly did when it was running below normal several years ago. And why can’t we see if the hypothesis is correct, that the increase in temperature was a function of the natural cyclical warming of the ocean, which are reversing now. Another 10-15 years, given 20 years of busted hype, is not going to hurt. And why shouldn’t people be very suspicious, given statements like this from the leaders of this movement: http://www.c3headlines.com/html 
So why would I not take these people at their words as to their true motives? As I have explained many times, climate is a TOOL for me to make my forecast. I am watching people ‘blame’ the Pacific for the very idea we used last year and this year to forecast a cold winter in the east, simply by using the same idea that we saw before. So it makes no difference to me. I will still use the methodology that people are discovering (the latest is the warm blob, apparently they are oblivious to 1917-1918, or the late 1950s, or 1970s, which Jerome Nemias wrote about many years ago. Do you know who Jerome Nemias is, David? But back to the easier question. Is NCEP, which clearly shows what is going on, now in the denier camp?”

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe DWD German Weather Service used to be a highly professional outfit. But over the last few years it seems to have been taken over by activists who have an agenda that is foreign to weather forecasting.
Statements released by the DWD over the recent years often contradict each other. For example in a recent press release the DWD claimed that the trend to a warmer climate remains uninterrupted, both globally and for Germany.
But this is in stark contradiction to the real global data which shows a stagnation approaching 20 years. Moreover the DWD’s own data on mean temperatures for Germany also show a clear stagnation. The warming trend is in fact interrupted:

Figure 1. Both global temperature and Germany’s annual mean temperature show interrupted warming. Chart: K.E. Puls.
Although 2014 saw a record warm year in Germany, the overall temperature trend over the last 17 years is one of cooling, as Figure 2 shows:

Figure 2: Germany’s annual mean temperature has been cooling over the last 17 years. Source: EIKE/K.E. Puls.
In 2012 the DWD wrote that the long term trend of rising temperatures was uninterrupted in both Germany and worldwide. But then just one year later, the DWD wrote in a May 7, 2013 press release (Hat-tip K.E. Puls):
The earth’s mean temperature has stagnated at a high level for 15 years…”

Is the temperature rise uninterrupted, or is it not?
On June 3, 2012, Gerhard Hofmann of the DWD confirmed on German public radio that the global temperature had not increased in 14 years.
Also Germany’s winters have also cooled over the past 28 years:

 Summer temperatures also have not been going up in Germany either:

Figure 4: Summer temperatures have been cooling over the past decade. Plot source: Josef Kowatsch; Chart K.E. Puls.
So where does the DWD get the idea that the climate warming has been uninterrupted? Answer: Certainly not from its own data.

"Copies of Indian newspapers onboard an Air India jet that crashed into Mont Blanc in the 1960s have been revealed by melting ice on the mountain’s Bossons glacier The papers, with headlines from when Indira Gandhi became India’s prime minister, were discovered by Timothée Mottin, who runs a cafe-restaurant, La Cabane du Cerro, at an altitude of 1,350 metres (4,455ft) above the French resort of Chamonix.  Air India flight 101 flew into the Europe’s highest mountain at 8am on 24 January 1966 after a verbal flight control miscommunication, leading to the loss of all 177 passengers and crew, although conspiracy theorists have offered other more lurid explanations. “They are drying now but they are in very good condition,” Mottin, 33, said of the newspaper. “You can read them.” “It’s not unusual. Every time we walk on the glacier with friends, we find remains of the crash,” Mottin added in an interview with Le Daupiné Libéré newspaper. “With experience, you know where they are. They are being carried along by the glacier according to their size,” he says. The cafe is about 45 minutes by foot from the Bossons glacier, where the plane named after the Himalayan peak of Kangchenjunga mysteriously crashed. Mottin said he was lucky to discover the papers when he did because the ice in which they had been encased for nearly six decades had probably only just melted. Once the papers have dried out, they will join a growing collection of items from the crash that Mottin has put on display at his cafe. He said he preferred to share his finds with visitors rather than “hide them in an attic waiting to sell them” – something he said had become a business for less scrupulous climbers. Since 2012, there have been a number of finds relating to the 1966 Air India crash emerging from the melting ice. In 2012, a bag of diplomatic mail, stamped “On Indian Government Service, Diplomatic Mail, Ministry of External Affairs”, was recovered, while a year later a French alpinist found a metal box containing the Air India logo containing emeralds, sapphires and rubies worth between €130,000-€246,000 (£117,000-£230,000) . Human remains found in the area in 2017 are also believed to come from the 1966 crash or that of another Indian plane, the Malabar Princess, that came down in the area in 1950. Objects from the crash are not the only objects to have been revealed in recent years on the glaciers around Mont Blanc and elsewhere in the Alps. Since the onset of global warming and glacial recession, the ice fields of the high mountains have become time capsules, returning long-hidden secrets to view including a number of historical artefacts from flight 101. The remains of missing climbers and hikers – some missing for decades – have turned up with increasing frequency as the Mont Blanc area has lost a quarter of its glacial ice. In 2017, in neighbouring Switzerland, a Swiss couple who had been missing for 75 years were found in the receding Tsanfleuron glacier. Marcelin and Françine Dumoulin had disappeared after going out to milk their cows in a meadow above Chandolin on 15 August 1942. In the Italian Alps, melting ice has even revealed bodies of fallen soldiers from the first world war, where Italian and Austro-Hungarian troops died in high-altitude trenches during the so-called “white war”. AFP contributed to this report"
"LOS ANGELES  —   When Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy were undergraduates at Stanford University, they made an unconventional observation about what makes a social network valuable. Thanks to the rise of Facebook, most everyone believed that networks became exponentially more valuable by amassing more users. But Mr. Spiegel noticed that in real life, even people with thousands of acquaintances spent most of their time with just a few friends whose value outweighed a large number of looser ties. So when Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy created Snapchat in 2011, they inverted the social networking dynamic. Out of their Stanford dorm rooms, they made Snapchat as an app that would send disappearing messages and photos in a way that more closely mimicked the dynamics of a real world conversation. That would increase the appeal of Snapchat as a service that people used with a small number of good friends, they figured. While online identity previously emphasized everything anyone has ever done, with Snapchat “my identity is who I am right now,” Mr. Spiegel said in a 2015 video to describe the app. Mr. Spiegel, 26, Snap’s chief executive, has since built a budding digital empire based on that initial unconventional insight  —   and has continued upending the tech industry with his different way of seeing the world, often with a touch of ego. Rather than accept the norms of the social networking ecosystem, he has stuck to atypical viewpoints on matters from mobile video to   spectacles. And he has done all of this more than 350 miles away from Silicon Valley, in the sunny climes of Venice, Calif. where Snapchat is based. Mr. Spiegel’s singular approach will soon be more publicly on display. This week, Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, is expected to reveal its public stock offering paperwork for the first time. The filing will show how Snap is doing as a business and whether that justifies a public valuation of $20 billion to $25 billion, which the company has been reported to be seeking. It will also disclose Mr. Spiegel’s ownership stake in Snap the public offering is set to vault Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy, who is now chief technology officer, into the ranks of other tech billionaires. Along with financial information, Mr. Spiegel is expected to include remarks about Snap’s mission that will showcase his    philosophy. “If you want to understand Snap, look at Evan Spiegel,” said Todd Chaffee, a partner at IVP, one of Snap’s three largest venture capital investors. “He is the visionary who drives that company. ” Mary Ritti, a spokeswoman for Snap, declined to comment for this story. Mr. Spiegel grew up in Pacific Palisades, a wealthy Los Angeles suburb, and attended Crossroads, a prep school in Santa Monica that counts Jonah Hill, Kate Hudson and Jack Black as alumni. He lived a privileged life, with expensive cars, exclusive club memberships and fancy vacations, according to records from his parents’ divorce proceedings. His father, John Spiegel, a securities lawyer who helped overhaul the Los Angeles Police Department after the Rodney King beating in 1991, also had his children volunteer and build homes in poor areas of Mexico. While many techies talk about how the industry is a meritocracy, Mr. Spiegel has not shied from his wealthy roots. In public comments, he has said he is “a young, white, educated male who got really, really lucky. And life isn’t fair. ” At Stanford, also his father’s alma mater, Mr. Spiegel majored in product design and started a handful of companies with Mr. Murphy, a fellow Kappa Sigma fraternity brother. (Their early   flopped.) There, Mr. Spiegel also met some of the men who would become his mentors, including Scott Cook, then the chief executive of Intuit, and Eric Schmidt, the Google chairman, who taught an M. B. A. class that he attended. Mr. Spiegel “really is the next Gates or Zuckerberg,” Mr. Schmidt said in an interview, comparing the Snap chief to Microsoft’s   Bill Gates, and Facebook’s chief, Mark Zuckerberg. “He has superb manners, which he says he got from his mother. He credits his father’s long legal calls, which he overheard, to giving him perspective on business and structure as a very young man. ” When Snapchat started taking off, Mr. Spiegel did not wait to graduate from Stanford. He moved the company to the Venice Beach boardwalk, away from what he perceived as Silicon Valley’s   focus on technology. His decamping for Southern California put off some in Silicon Valley. The perception of a divide with Silicon Valley was also fostered by Mr. Spiegel’s rejection of a $3 billion acquisition offer from Facebook in 2013. Some who met Mr. Spiegel during Snapchat’s early days at Stanford describe him as akin to the villain of a 1980s teen movie. He often came across as having a healthy ego, an impression Mr. Spiegel sometimes stoked. When Mr. Spiegel met Institutional Venture Partners to discuss possible   for example, he told IVP’s partner, Dennis Phelps, that he was unwilling to accept the firm’s standard investment terms. “If you want standard terms, invest in a standard company,” Mr. Phelps recalled Mr. Spiegel telling him. IVP went on to invest in Snap’s third financing round in 2013. In Los Angeles, Mr. Spiegel has shown interest in the city’s fashion, art and music scene. He met his fiancée, the model Miranda Kerr, at a Louis Vuitton dinner. And he once toyed with the idea of owning a record label with ties to Snapchat, according to a 2015 email between Sony executives that was released by hackers. “He’s different from most tech people because he knows what’s cool and what’s next,” said Ryan Wilson, an artist in Los Angeles who goes by the name ThankYouX. He worked with Mr. Spiegel on a piece of art for one of Snapchat’s offices. “He doesn’t like things because a dealer says he should. He just likes what he likes, whether it’s made by a high school friend or a famous artist. ” Mr. Spiegel has also involved himself in some political conversations. In 2015, he met with China’s president, Xi Jinping, as a member of the 21st Century Council at the Berggruen Institute. Its founder, Nicolas Berggruen, said he impressed a group that includes Mohamed   the economist, and former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with his “thoughtful and mature approach to people. ” Last fall, Mr. Spiegel also attended a private dinner with John O. Brennan, then the director of the C. I. A. According to multiple attendees, Mr. Spiegel listened more than he spoke and had the ear of Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles. Mr. Spiegel’s unconventional streak may be most evident in how he has steered Snap. He has long said that a public offering was what was best for the company and its investors, even as other tech   chose to stay private as long as possible. Since Snapchat’s debut, the app and the company have also undergone dozens of changes that were criticized for being too different from other consumer internet companies. Mr. Spiegel rejected the idea of a newsfeed in Snapchat’s app, for example, because he said people prefer stories chronologically. In Facebook’s News Feed, posts are reverse chronological, meaning the newest posts are at the top. Unlike other social networks, Snapchat also does not use algorithms to push people to see certain content. Snapchat users swipe their screens to navigate and view video vertically, rather than tap on menus or turn their phones to watch videos horizontally. “From what I can figure out, he thinks differently about the way to monetize and develop a social network,” Mr. Schmidt said of Mr. Spiegel. Investors who buy into Snap’s initial public offering will soon be getting a piece of that approach. Allowing “ourselves to be pulled in another direction” is what makes us human, Mr. Spiegel said in a commencement speech at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business in 2015. Quoting John F. Kennedy, he added, “Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth. ”"
"I initiated a letter of support to climate striking students – an English version of the German letter coordinated by ecologist Gregor Hagerdorn, signed by more than 1,000 academics – for many reasons. My role as a university lecturer means that I am committed to fostering better lives and opportunities for each generation. I am also a parent, so when I hear the request from youth, including my students and child to stand with them, I am naturally inclined to give their case fair consideration. But I am a scientific researcher, too. The first, core demand of the striking students, led by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, is to “unite behind the science”. How could I not recognise the significance of this demand in a communication landscape too often dominated by short-term sensationalism, rather than the core challenges facing society and the living planet? But there’s a deeper, more fundamental reason to support the global strike for climate, grounded in my own field of political and ecological economics.  My research focuses on how, if at all, we can create an economy that is focused on achieving human well-being and avoiding damage to the environment. The current prospect is not good. No country yet meets most needs of citizens at a sustainable level of resource use. But my research also shows that it may be possible to do this and more. We have the capability to meet basic needs and achieve high levels of human well-being at modest levels of energy use. And beyond this moderate amount, there is no reliable relationship between energy use and well-being. In many cases, added energy can even harm human health and well-being through air pollution, climate impacts, road accidents, and lack of exercise. A rapid, radical reduction in energy demand could perhaps fulfil both goals of addressing climate breakdown and enabling our students and children to live good lives: what Kate Raworth calls living within the “doughnut”. So why is this option not debated and put forward through an ambitious policy agenda? The answer is both simple and profound. My research area remains marginal, and its results neglected, because to accept it would require a fundamental transformation of the prevailing economic philosophy. We would need to pay less attention to growth and profit as the measures of prosperity, and replace them with sufficiency and equity – a fair division of resources to provide what is sufficient for well-being and not more. After centuries of entrenchment, that’s no easy feat. But neoclassical economics itself is not the main culprit in our planetary predicament. When we look deeper, and seek to understand the factors underpinning the rise in consumption culture that drives our energy use, we are confronted with a problem of the way production relates to politics.

      Surviving climate change means transforming both economics and design


 The production, pricing, and consumption of goods and services are not simply driven by the natural balancing of supply and demand. The economy is best understood as a social and political arena. In this arena, highly productive industries invest heavily in advertising to artificially grow consumption. As my upcoming research shows, they coalesce in aligned mega-sectors, such as the automotive, road-building and real estate industries, all of which wield outsize political influence, and have a vested interest in trapping consumers in car-intensive, road-intensive, suburban housing. The paradox of high resource use that results in little or no human benefits has its roots in the very structure of our political economy, and the industries that are some of its most important mainstays. Transforming this structure means challenging these sectors, and finding ways to counter their excessive influence in our democracies. This is why we must support the students’ strike this Friday, and every Friday for the foreseeable future. Significant change will not come into being without protests and solidarity movements that rigorously question unacceptable modes of living and politics. It is time for all of us to wake politicians, businesses, and institutions up to the immense task of transforming our societies. This article is part of The Covering Climate Now series

"**Unprecedented is a dangerous word in journalism, but this really hasn't happened before.**
On Wednesday, four of the biggest names in tech will give evidence to members of the US Congress.
Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook), Sundar Pichai (Google), Tim Cook (Apple) and Jeff Bezos (Amazon) will all be grilled.
Jeff Bezos - the world's richest man - has never testified before either house. They have never all been quizzed together.
How these tech bosses do, how they stand up to scrutiny, could be a defining moment in their future relationship with government.
Central to the interrogation will be whether these tech giants are simply too big.
The Covid pandemic has put this into sharp focus. Where other companies have struggled, Big Tech companies have thrived. Together they are now worth $5tn dollars. It's led to accusations that - just like the banks - they are simply too big to fail.
The number of complaints levelled at these companies are so numerous they are too many to name individually here.
In pre-released comments, Mark Zuckerberg argued that Facebook had become successful ""the American way"" - providing products that people find valuable after starting with nothing.
""Our story would not have been possible without US laws that encourage competition and innovation,"" he said.
But he acknowledged that there were concerns about the size and perceived power of technology companies and that there should be a more active role for governments and regulators - and updated rules for the internet.
Jeff Bezos posted his opening statement to Congress.
""At Amazon, customer obsession has made us what we are, and allowed us to do ever greater things,"" he said.
""I know what Amazon could do when we were 10 people. I know what we could do when we were 1,000 people, and when we were 10,000 people. And I know what we can do today when we're nearly a million.""
""I believe Amazon should be scrutinized,"" he added. ""We should scrutinize all large institutions, whether they're companies, government agencies, or non-profits. Our responsibility is to make sure we pass such scrutiny with flying colours.""
The general theme is that these companies don't just run services - they own the internet's utilities. The charge is that they use that commanding position unfairly at the expense of others.
Take one of the criticisms against Amazon, for example, that it promotes its own products over others on its Amazon marketplace.
Or Apple charging a 30% cut on the money generated from apps that use the App Store.
The complaint from app makers: where else do we go to sell our apps? Apple and Google (which respectively own iOS and Android, the operating systems of almost all the world's smartphones) control the market, and so control who gets to play and who doesn't. And they of course get to set the charges.
Google too, with its dominant search engine, has been accused (and fined) before, for burying competitor searches. Once again, the accusation is that no one company should have such a commanding position in an essential part of our internet.
And there are general criticisms that can be levelled at all the tech giants too. For example the alleged Copy/Acquire/Kill strategies that all four are accused of using.
Copy others' ideas, buy a company that threatens you - and even potentially kill it off. Is this just shrewd, albeit ruthless business? Or is this Big Tech flexing its muscle unfairly?
Here's why this has been such a difficult area to police. Traditionally, anti-competition law - in this case ""anti-trust"" law - has been focused on consumer pricing.
In a typical monopoly or cartel, there's a simple test. Are consumers paying more because of a lack of competition?
The US ""trusts"" of the early 20th Century - from which the anti-trust legislation derives its name - were found to be driving up prices. Companies like Standard Oil and railway companies used their dominant position to hurt consumers.
That's much harder to prove with these tech companies.
For example Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are free. Amazon often drives down prices to beat competition. Google's search engine is free. YouTube - owned by Google - is free. And apps on iPhones can often be downloaded for free.
That is the heart of the argument. Critics say that these companies hurt consumers in a more subtle way, killing off smaller companies and strangling other businesses. The charge is that they are in fact damaging the economy.
That's what legislators are looking to examine.
Anti-trust campaigners have already lost one battle before the hearing even begins. They wanted to have the tech bosses grilled one by one.
""We want to leave as little room as possible for them to hide behind each other,"" Sarah Miller, from the American Economics Liberties Project, told me last week.
But that's not going to happen. They'll be questioned together and the hearing will - perhaps aptly - be virtual.
There are also worries that members of Congress will use the occasion to grandstand - to strut and preen - rather than asking the more difficult technical questions that might catch them out.
Off-topic questions are also likely - particularly for Mark Zuckerberg. For example, Facebook is currently the focus of an advertising boycott. It's accused of being too slow in removing racist and hateful content, and that could well be a line of questioning.
And of course, ahead of the US elections, Facebook should expect incoming from both Republican and Democratic members of Congress. Democrats are generally concerned about far-right content on the platform, Republicans that the company is structurally left-wing. And of course there are still concerns of foreign interference.
Expect China to come up too - and for it to be brought up by the tech bosses. With companies like TikTok and Huawei attracting the ire of the Trump administration, one defence will go something like: ""Break us up, overregulate us, and you give Chinese tech companies more power.""
Trying to prise the four away from their scripts is going to be the toughest job. That worked most effectively during Mr Zuckerberg's interrogation on Capitol Hill in 2018. But that's harder said than done.
Congress has a big opportunity here. The chance to really cross-examine these powerful men doesn't come often, and the evidence they give could shape their future relationship with government and their customers.
But whatever happens on Wednesday, this won't be end of the story. Earlier this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee's anti-trust panel said it would hold a hearing in September to discuss Google's dominance in online advertising."
"Killing animals for fun is an activity which divides opinion. It can also be a highly emotive issue, with high profile cases like the death of Cecil the lion sparking global media coverage and outcry. There were even calls for the American dentist who admitted killing Cecil to be charged with illegal hunting.  But despite the strong feelings it occasionally provokes, many people may be unaware just how common trophy hunting is. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) reports that between 2004 and 2014, a total of 107 countries participated in the trophy hunting business. In that time, it is thought over 200,000 hunting trophies from threatened species were traded (plus a further 1.7m from non-threatened animals). Trophy hunters themselves pay vast sums of money to do what they do (IFAW claims upwards of $US100,000 for a 21-day big game hunting trip). But reliable data on the economic benefits this brings to the countries visited remains limited and contested. Now the UK government has announced it is considering banning the trade of hunting trophies from endangered species – making it a crime to bring them back into the country. Advocates of trophy hunting – including major conservation organisations such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the World Wide Fund for Nature – argue that hunting wild animals can have major ecological benefits. Along with some governments, they claim that “well-managed” trophy hunting is an effective conservation tool, which can also help local communities.  This argument depends in part on the generation of significant income from the trophy hunters, which, it is claimed, can then be reinvested into conservation activities.   The broad idea is that a few (often endangered) animals are sacrificed for the greater good of species survival and biodiversity. Local human communities also benefit financially from protecting animal populations (rather than seeing them as a threat) and may reap the rewards of employment by hunting operations, providing lodgings or selling goods. Indeed, research on trophy hunting does show that it can produce substantial financial benefits, is likely to be supported by local communities, and can be associated with conservation gains.  But it remains unclear in exactly what circumstances trophy hunting produces a valuable conservation benefit. We cannot assume a scheme that works in one country, targeting one species, under a specific set of circumstances, is applicable to all other species and locations. Also, the purported benefits of trophy hunting rely on sustainable management, investment of profits, and local community involvement. But given the levels of perceived corruption and lack of effective governance in some of the countries where trophy hunting is carried out, one wonders how likely it is these conditions can be met.  And if trophy hunting is really so lucrative, there is every chance the profits will instead be used to line the pockets of rich (possibly foreign) operators and officials. This brings us to the question of ethics. Just because an intervention has the potential to produce a social benefit, does not mean the approach is ethical. And if it is not ethical, should it be considered a crime?  This is something of regular concern for social policy. If the evil that a programme introduces is greater than the evil it purports to reduce, then it is unethical to implement it.  I would argue that even if convincing evidence does exist that trophy hunting can produce conservation benefits, it is unethical to cause the death and suffering of individual animals to save a species.  In common with many green criminologists, I take a critical approach to the study of environmental and animal-related crime. This means that I am interested in behaviour that can be thought of as harmful, and may be worthy of the label “crime”, even if it has not been formally criminalised.  When considering global harms and those that impact heavily on the most powerless in society, this approach is particularly important.  Conservation is concerned with biodiversity and animal populations. Contrast this with an animal rights or species justice perspective, where instead of focusing on rights that benefit humans over all other species, the interests and intrinsic rights of individual and groups of animals are considered.  From this viewpoint, trophy hunting undoubtedly causes harm. It brings pain, fear, suffering and death. Add to this the grief, mourning and fracturing of familial or social groups that is experienced by animals such as elephants, whales, primates and giraffes. In light of these harms, trophy hunting is surely worthy of the label “crime”.  Allowing trophy hunting also perpetuates the notion that animals are lesser than humans. It turns wildlife into a commodity, rather than living, feeling, autonomous beings – beings that I have argued should be viewed as victims of crime.  Anthropocentric views also facilitate and normalise the exploitation, death and mistreatment of animals. The harmful effects can be seen in intensive farming, marine parks and “canned hunting”, where (usually lions) are bred in captivity (and sometimes drugged) as part of trophy hunting operations. Where money can be made from animals, exploitation, and wildlife crime, seem likely to follow. Instead, local communities must be involved in decisions about conservation and land management, but not at the expense of endangered species, or of individual animals hunted for sport. Alternative conservation approaches like photo tourism, and schemes to reduce human-animal conflict must be embraced.  Banning trophy hunting would provide a much needed incentive to develop creative conservation approaches to wildlife protection and human-animal co-existence. And there is still substantial conservation income to be earned without resorting to trophy hunting.  So governments around the world should introduce bans on trophy imports – alongside providing support for alternative, ethical developments that benefit both wild animals and local communities. Anything less is complicit support of a crime against some of the world’s most vulnerable wildlife."
"**""Never known anything like it in my lifetime.""**
That's a line we'll all have heard in the 100 days since Boris Johnson announced the coronavirus lockdown on 23 March.
Normally it'd be something your nan might say. For Telford in Shropshire, it's true of an entire town.
Throughout the last 100 days, Radio 1 Newsbeat has been in touch with people in Telford about how lockdown has changed them and their lives.
There's the local footballer who has no idea what will happen to his career, the personal trainer who had to change her business overnight and the rapper who thought 2020 would be his best yet.
Telford has only existed since the late 1960s - built then to offer new housing to people from much busier cities. After 50 years, it's still called ""a new town"".
""It's got a perfect blend of rural and urban,"" 18-year-old Molly Morgan tells us about her hometown. ""It's a great place to grow up.""
""I've grown up here, my family's here, my future's here,"" adds personal trainer Esther Williams.
""It's got a great community. When I was younger, I'd have gone to Birmingham or Wolverhampton for the day but now there's so much to do in Telford.""
Telford was a far more ambitious project than other new towns of the era, like Stevenage and Crawley.
The aim was for 225,000 people to live there by 1991. In 2020 there are around 155,000.
The town is cut down the middle by the motorway linking Shropshire with the Black Country. Famous brands including Hitachi take sites on the industrial Stafford Park to the east, with the world famous Iron Bridge, arching over the River Severn, a couple of miles to the south.
The idea for Telford was to bring smaller towns, like Dawley and Lawley, together into one community.
""It's got a magnificent situation overlooking Shropshireâ¦ I think it's got the makings of a very fine town indeed,"" were the words of Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, former City Architect of Birmingham, who helped with the plans.
""Once an attractive town is built there - industry will go,"" he said.
In lockdown, Telford is a community facing some of its biggest challenges - and the people we've been talking to spoke about challenges that will feel very familiar. In many of the stories you hear, it's the mood of uncertainty which keeps coming up.
Esther's personal training firm, Ruthless, takes up a small corrugated unit on the sprawling industrial estate of Hortonwood, where both Epson and Heinz have bases.
She only started her business in 2018 and its whole model was transformed overnight on 23 March when the prime minister addressed the country and told us that all non-essential businesses, including gyms, must close.
Esther's been paying full rent on the unit during lockdown and is still waiting for the government to say she can re-open. In the meantime, her focus is online sessions and small exercise classes in the park.
""The work I'm doing is great, and I'm so grateful for that, but it's not quite enough to be able to keep paying the rent there.""
During that first week of lockdown, Esther told her clients on Facebook: ""We will be back. We will be stronger. We will be unstoppable.""
Looking back now, she adds: ""I've never done online so I was quite nervous. I went to Zoom having never used Zoom before.
""For me, it was completely different. It was daunting to begin with but I'm so glad I did.""
You can't help but notice Esther says ""so grateful"" and ""so glad"" a lot. She acknowledges others businesses have not had her flexibility.
Esther's husband lost his job in sales but couldn't get furlough as he'd only been with his company a short time.
""He's just starting now to get interviews. The stress of trying to find a job - even a temporary job - they just go so quick. Things are getting better now. I'm just lucky I can work now and things are starting to move.""
From Esther's unit to one of the town's focal points - the New Bucks Head, home to non-league AFC Telford United - is just a seven-minute drive.
For the sixth tier of English football, it's impressive. A 6,000-capacity stadium would surely be one of the bigger days out in the National League North. Guiseley AFC and Curzon Ashton are typical visitors.
AFC Telford United typically get a thousand people turning up to home games but there's been nobody through the turnstiles since Kettering Town on 14 March - and without any income from tickets, the club's faced desperate measures.
On a Go Fund Me page seeking donations, a message reads: ""All of our income streams have dramatically reduced to virtually zero for several weeks now and it's almost certain as a business it will take some time to recover.""
Midfielder Adam Walker says the months without football have been tough on the players too. They said goodbye to each other after a fairly regular match - minus the handshakes - expecting to see each other again later in the same week.
""And that never happened. So it's been a big gap in everyone's lives really.""
Adam has become something of an unofficial spokesman for the players. He says some are having to look at a career change.
""There's a very dark mist overhead still until this is resolved. There's massive uncertainty on how many clubs will be able to survive.""
He points to the potential impact that could have on this community.
""A club like Telford have always had a very good side and a lovely stadium. You take that away from the community and there'd be a massive hole there.""
Without the guarantees of gate receipts, the club's been helping its players find other work, such as coaching.
""The gaffer's tried to help players at the end of their career or maybe the younger ones who don't know yet whether they'll get paid for football and they might have young families.
""It's showing them how to be employable because a lot of people will be looking for jobs in this period.
""It's to try to help people have an income and still play football.""
There has been football on the Bucks Head site for a century, but the area's not had the biggest live music scene recently.
""Telford has had a shortage of actual live music venues. One of the main ones closed down a few years ago,"" says Tim Rogers - a financial services worker by day, who takes off the suit and tie to become rapper Trademark Blud out of office hours.
This year felt like a moment of change - with a new 300-capacity venue opening in the town's Southwater Square.
It's easy to imagine Southwater Square without ever visiting. Cineworld, Nando's, TGi Fridays, all built in the last few years - all designed to give people in Telford a new option for a night out.
Tim thought the new venue was going to be a big moment for the local live scene - with the prospect of international names coming to Telford.
""It's terrible. The most important thing is being able to deliver what you've produced to people and see their reactions and let them enjoy in the way you hope they will.""
He sounds undeniably flat talking about his music. He's been doing shows online but ""they're not the same"".
""It's not even 50% - especially with rap and hip-hop as it's super energetic.""
To top it off, he had festival bookings for Boomtown and B-Side festival in 2020, which obviously won't be happening.
Outside of music though Tim says he's feeling ""much more comfortable"" about the pandemic - his fears of picking it up have reduced and he's settled into working at home.
Covid came closer than he'd like though - a child in his son's class lost his father after he contracted the virus.
For 18-year-old Molly, the latest lockdown easing is a bit of good news - she's got her friend's 18th birthday the week when new measures come into effect, so they'll get a celebration.
Beyond that, Molly's future will probably be closer to Telford than she'd been planning.
She should have just finished her A-Levels. But of course she never actually sat them and has tweaked her uni choices because she didn't get to finish her open day tours.
Now, she's looking at PPE (not that one, she jokes, after pulling her own face covering down) in Liverpool or Birmingham. This PPE is politics, philosophy and economics.
""I'd have been more open to going further away but without the chance to visit, I was apprehensive to go somewhere without seeing the city. I'd have been a bit more adventurous.""
Molly says she's nervous about the prospect of her first year at university being mostly online learning.
""I don't want to stay in my room essentially for the whole yearâ¦ I'm not sure that's right for me. I've toyed with delaying for a year to get the proper uni experience.""
Molly will know more when the results come in August, Adam's keeping the training going waiting for news on the new season. Esther hopes her unit will be open for classes after the next wave of government announcements.
And rapper Trademark Blud? He's eyeing up a plan B.
""Some of my friends are acoustic guitarists and they might get back and start gigging again. It's maybe difficult for my genre - it's more of a live venue, nightclub, big stage kind of thing.
""I'm thinking of working with some guitarists and going to do the local pubs. I don't think they'll appreciate me jumping around and jumping off the tables at six o'clock. We'll have to tone it down I think.""

"**A member of Facebook's new oversight board has warned that it should avoid launching too quickly.**
Alan Rusbridger told BBC Click that it would be ""great to be up and running"" in time for November's US elections.
But in an exclusive interview, he said it would be damaging to ""come out with half-baked recommendations now before we are ready"".
He did not yet know whether it would be ready to make ""key decisions on the hot potatoes"" of the Presidential election.
Mr Rusbridger also acknowledged calls for existing members of the board to weigh in on whether Facebook should follow Twitter in labelling and hiding some of President Donald Trump's posts.
But he said that without having studied the matter in a ""sophisticated way"", it would be ""a bad way to proceed"".
Facebook has said the panel is supposed to act as a kind of supreme court, with the power to override decisions made by the social network's own moderators and influence policy.
Its eventual 40 members will be paid by Facebook but are intended to act as an independent body.
But not everyone is convinced of the scheme.
""Mark (Zuckerberg) controls the organisation,"" claimed Rashad Robinson of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which has urged firms to pull ads from the platform.
""I think it's a huge mistake for these individuals because unless they are going to change the infrastructure and change the incentives, then you are not actually going to change how things roll out.
""It's like saying you're a member of Congress but not actually having a vote on the floor.""
Mr Rusbridger, a former editor-in-chief of the Guardian, acknowledged that many people were sceptical about the initiative but said it was ""worth a try"" to see whether the board could help Facebook's ""engineers think through the moral, legal, editorial and ethical considerations that they have to wrestle with"".
""If after two-to-three years we found out we are not having much of an impact, I guess a number of the board members would think: is this really worth it?"" he said.
But he acknowledged: ""We're going to be criticised whatever we do.""
The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.
**Are you happy with the mix of people on the board?**
I gather, they spoke to about 2,000 people - it certainly took them a long time. And it's a very interesting mix, in terms of geographical location, diversity and diversity of ethnicity. It's so you've got a sort of interesting bunch of lawyers, human rights activists, academics, journalists, troublemakers. If you wanted a quiet life, I don't think you would have chosen this board.
**What made you take the job?**
This issue of how the internet is regulated, or regulates itself, is one of the most important issues imaginable. We're facing a crisis of trust of knowing what's true and what's not true. And as somebody who passionately believed in the dream, the opportunity that the internet offered, it's been very sad to see it get into some degree of trouble. So, if we can pull this off, that would be an incredibly valuable thing to do.
**Being paid by Facebook is going to be a challenge when it comes to convincing people about this.**
What Facebook has done is to set up something like a trust. And although for the first few meetings there were Facebook people in the room, there are not now. It feels as though we are now an independent entity. So although the real money was provided by Facebook, I don't think we're going to have much to do with them in future.
**How will this work in practice?**
Facebook will come to us and say: here's a particularly thorny problem. And I expect there will be a big demand from users, saying: please get a grip on X, Y and Z, or here's a case where I feel aggrieved because I was ruled against and I want you to reconsider it. And we can choose for ourselves to say we want to look at a particular case.
**Aren't you going to be swamped?**
No, We can't possibly deal with the millions of issues that are contested on Facebook. So it comes back to trying to choose cases that seem to be typical of bigger, more wide-scale problems.
**Will you publish your recommendations before Facebook has decided whether to listen to them or not?**
We will certainly publish them independently of Facebook. We're in control of what we publish or not. Any suggestion that we were not publishing our opinions because Facebook didn't like them would be deadly to the project.
**Do you have an eye on the other social media platforms? Twitter has taken a different approach to labelling Donald Trump's posts, for example, to Facebook.**
We all have noticed the difference between the Twitter response and the Facebook response. I don't know enough about the culture of the few companies to explain why they came to different decisions. But I can see why a company would have got itself into a position of saying the First Amendment [to freedom of speech] is going to be our guiding star. Whether that is a tenable or right position, I don't know. That's one of the jobs that we're going to have to start thinking about. I can see why you would start there but maybe that's not a tenable, desirable position to end up with.
**Do you feel that you're putting your reputation on the line here?**
It's an interesting, valuable thing to attempt. If Facebook ignore it, or if it doesn't look as though it's working, then there's no incentive to stay.

"The government’s new plans to upgrade the energy efficiency of homes will make only a fraction of the progress needed to help the UK meet its legally binding climate targets, according to a new study. A report by IPPR, a left-leaning thinktank, has found at least 12 million homes will need to be fitted with low-carbon heat pumps and energy efficiency measures, such as insulation, over the next 30 years for the UK to meet its net zero targets.  However, Rishi Sunak’s pledge to fund a new energy efficiency plan with £3bn of spending is less than a third of the investment needed, and its plans to install heat pumps will deliver less than 2% of the number required, according to the report. Joshua Emden, a researcher at IPPR, said the government’s focus on energy efficiency in the recent summer statement should be paired with low carbon heating technologies, such as heat pumps, to “maximise the potential for savings on energy bills” and carbon emissions. By throwing its weight behind heat pumps now, the industry will be able to focus on the challenge of fitting the low-carbon tech to homes across the country, and begin creating new jobs and apprenticeships by training new workers, he said. The UK’s draughty homes would need spending of more than£10.6bn a year from both public and private investment until 2030 to meet the UK’s target to reduce carbon emissions. A further £7bn a year will be needed between 2030 to 2050 to meet the UK’s legally binding commitment to create a net zero carbon economy by 2050. IPPR said the extra investment would also bring “considerable rewards beyond helping to tackle the climate crisis”, including the creation of 275,000 jobs in England alone and lower energy bills for households."
"Vincent Viola, a billionaire Wall Street trader and President Trump’s nominee for secretary of the Army, abruptly withdrew his name for the post on Friday night after concluding it would be too difficult to untangle himself from his business ties, two government officials said. Mr. Viola is an owner of the Florida Panthers hockey club and a majority shareholder in Virtu Financial and Eastern Air Lines, among a number of other business interests. This week The New York Times reported that Mr. Viola had been negotiating to swap his stake in Eastern Air Lines for a stake in Swift Air, an airline with government subcontracts. If his nomination had continued, he would have faced certain scrutiny for potentially becoming a government official who benefits from federal contracts. The Trump administration did not announce his withdrawal, which was reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News, but a senior administration official and a Pentagon official separately confirmed his decision, which the White House accepted Friday. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity. Mr. Viola is a 1977 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, and he last served in the Army Reserves at the rank of major. He remained connected to the military through donations to West Point, including to the academy’s Combating Terrorism Center. A former Pentagon official and close friend said Mr. Viola was devastated over having to withdraw from what he described as a lifelong dream job. But the former official said Mr. Viola felt he was unable to sell his interest in some of his holdings because doing so could have destroyed those companies. His decision followed weeks of negotiations between his lawyers and the government as they sought to find a solution. Ultimately, they could not. Mr. Viola has a net worth of almost $1. 8 billion and is a   of Virtu. Virtu had planned to go public in 2014, but pulled the plug on the move because of choppy markets and lingering questions around how   trading firms like Virtu make money. In a regulatory filing at the time, Virtu said regulators were looking into its trading practices. It is not known if this issue played a role in Mr. Viola’s decision to withdraw his name for the Army secretary job, which is a post that requires Senate confirmation. His decision to withdraw comes the same week another of Mr. Trump’s appointees, Anthony Scaramucci, was told he would not get a top job at the White House amid concerns about the recent sale of his company to a large Chinese conglomerate. In an episode unrelated to the finances of Mr. Viola, it was recently revealed that he was involved in an altercation in August: He was accused of punching a concessions worker at a racehorse auction in Saratoga Springs, N. Y. No charges were brought against him. Mr. Viola was one of the first nominations Mr. Trump issued the day he was inaugurated. “Vincent Viola, everybody likes Vincent,” Mr. Trump said just hours after his   as he signed orders nominating his cabinet."
"The coronavirus pandemic has led to the largest drop in heat-trapping emissions in human history, according to a new study.  Lockdowns, travel bans and closed manufacturing sites have caused global emissions to drop by 4.6%, or 2.5 gigatonnes, according to a University of Sydney review of 38 regions and 26 sectors published in the journal Plos One. Fine particle pollution decreased by 3.8% and two other types of air pollution declined 2.9%: sulfur dioxide – which is linked to a number of respiratory issues, and nitrogen oxide, which leads to smog.  The largest emissions drops occurred in the United States and China, largely due to grounded air travel and a decrease in power, water and gas use, but they come with a large economic cost. From late February to May, the study found the pandemic caused 147 million people, or 4.2% of the global workforce, to lose full-time jobs and triggered a $3.8tn drop in consumption, making it the worst economic shock since the Great Depression, according to co-author Arunima Malik. Europe also saw a significant economic dip, but it lagged in emissions reductions because its economy is less reliant on fossil fuels. The dramatic decline still falls short of the efforts needed to limit global heating to 1.5C by 2050, however. Even if global greenhouse gas emissions were to sustain the 4.6% decline each year, emissions would need to drop another 3% every year between 2020 and 2030 to be on track to limit global warming and avoid the most extreme outcomes of the climate crisis. And emissions will rebound as countries reopen. The last time the globe experienced a dramatic drop in emissions was during the 2009 financial crisis, which decreased carbon dioxide emissions by 0.46 gigatonnes. The economic downturn of the last three months will deepen socioeconomic vulnerabilities, widen wealth gaps and overburden healthcare systems, especially in lower-income countries, according to the study. “This is the dilemma of the social, environmental and economic systems – the fact that these systems are so interconnected and you can’t really address one system in isolation,” Malik said. “So there’s an economic downturn that results in reduction of emissions. But so many people have lost their jobs, and the environment might not be the top priority for them.” A separate new analysis from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale and Northwestern universities found that pushing back investments in renewable power for one year could outweigh the emissions reductions and deaths avoided from the reductions in pollution that have been seen since March. Malik said the reductions necessary would require a complete redesign of the economic systems. “When it comes to the post-pandemic world, I would like to think that perhaps this is an opportunity for us to redesign the systems in a way that they are sustainable and inclusive,” Malik said. “I don’t have a perfect answer to this and I don’t think most people do – it’s a dilemma in our systems.”"
"First, I should lay down my cards and show my hand. My name is Jules, and I am a card-carrying fan of newts. I have a pond. I once ran an amphibian helpline for people with questions about newts. I have worn a newt costume at family events. I can’t stress this enough: I genuinely like newts. Earlier this week, newts featured in Johnson’s Build, build, build speech – where plans were announced to revive Britain’s flagging economy with a programme of construction – housing, hospitals, prisons, roads, schools. But this wasn’t a star turn for newts. Far from it.  “Covid-19 has taught us the cost of delay,” Johnson said in the speech. “Time is money. And the newt-counting delays in our system are a massive drag on the productivity and prosperity of this country.” By “newt-counting” Johnson is nodding to the EU’s Habitats Directive, which sees countries under EU and UK law obliged to offer protection to the most regal of newts, the great crested newt. This means that its habitats (ponds, mostly) require protection from those eager to demolish them to make way for other things, and, in some cases, the requirement that new ponds be dug for them if this is not possible. To gauge whether great crested newts may or may not be present on a site before any building takes place, a survey is sometimes undertaken – newts are “counted” in Johnson-speak.  At this point, you may find yourself duty-bound to tell me some things you think you know about newts and other threatened species (such as bats) that apparently hamper the economic growth of our country. You’ll tell me that newts slow down the speed at which housing developments can be built, leaving people in the hands of rented accommodation for longer. You’ll tell me that great crested newts can be quite common locally in parts of Britain, unlike in the rest of Europe, but we have to protect them because of some arcane EU law. You’ll tell me that they add thousands of pounds to the (cash-strapped) developer’s bill. Well, firstly, it’s certainly true that we appear to be slower than other countries in Europe at building houses, but is it really the fault of newts and other threatened species? According to 2018’s independent government review into build-out rates (commissioned by former chancellor Philip Hammond) the answer is no. Apparently, the problem is that developers are often too fixated on three-bedroom properties in the £400,000 price bracket whose release on the market can be staggered to “guarantee a steady stream of buyers”. It’s this, more than anything else, that slows things down. The idea that protected species law is written on some Brussels tablet of stone is another straw man. Yes, great crested newts are legally protected, but the way we implement that legislation regularly changes. Last year, for instance, the government announced to great fanfare that it was streamlining the whole process of issuing newt licences, so that developers can get to work more quickly. Strange that Johnson didn’t refer to these actions, undertaken by the previous Conservative government, which he waspart of. Nope, no point. We need a scapegoat, he thinks. Again. This is a shame because great crested newts really should be something we celebrate in Britain. The new ponds that great crested newt mitigation encourages, for instance, can be of important local value. In fact, if you live in a new housing estate and enjoyed your lockdown walks next to a gorgeous leafy pond, it may be newts you have to thank. In this way, rather than inhibit growth, the great crested newts (and the legislations they are afforded) can help communities retain, even enhance, their economic value over time. These ponds also store carbon at a rate almost unmatched by any other terrestrial habitat. And crucially, each new pond counters the loss of the 500,000 countryside ponds (each supporting thousands of species) that were lost or filled in during previous decades. What’s most frustrating about all of this bluster is that it takes us away from the bigger picture. That rebooting the economy doesn’t happen in a press conference, hard hat on head and wacky grin for the photo-op, but in working in partnership with the organisations that understand the issues, that can help restore nature, tackle the climate crisis, and rebuild communities and local economies in the process. This rhetoric pits nature against economic development and reduces us all in the process. We all want the UK to prosper. What we don’t need is more straw men and enemies at the gates. It’s not that we want or expect more from Johnson. It’s that, truthfully, we are going to need to end this false dichotomy between the natural world and the economy if we are to emerge from this turbulent time in a better state than before. • Jules Howard is a zoologist and the author of Sex on Earth and Death on Earth"
"A few weeks ago, in reaction to something we had written about blackness and whiteness in recent movies, my colleague Manohla Dargis and I received a note from a reader. “Since when is everything about race?” he wanted to know. Perhaps it was a rhetorical question. A flippant  —   though by no means inaccurate  —   answer would have been 1619. But a more constructive response might have been to recommend Raoul Peck’s   new documentary, “I Am Not Your Negro. ” Let me do so now, for that reader (if he’s still interested) and for everybody else, too. Whatever you think about the past and future of what used to be called “race relations”  —   white supremacy and the resistance to it, in plainer English  —   this movie will make you think again, and may even change your mind. Though its principal figure, the novelist, playwright and essayist James Baldwin, is a man who has been dead for nearly 30 years, you would be   to find a movie that speaks to the present moment with greater clarity and force, insisting on uncomfortable truths and drawing stark lessons from the shadows of history. To call “I Am Not Your Negro” a movie about James Baldwin would be to understate Mr. Peck’s achievement. It’s more of a posthumous collaboration, an uncanny and thrilling communion between the filmmaker  —   whose previous work includes both a documentary and a narrative feature about the Congolese   leader Patrice Lumumba  —   and his subject. The   narration (read by Samuel L. Jackson) is entirely drawn from Baldwin’s work. Much of it comes from notes and letters written in the   when Baldwin was somewhat reluctantly sketching out a book, never to be completed, about the lives and deaths of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Reflections on those men (all of whom Baldwin knew well) and their legacies are interspersed with passages from other books and essays, notably “The Devil Finds Work,” Baldwin’s 1976 meditation on race, Hollywood and the mythology of white innocence. His published and unpublished words  —   some of the most powerful and penetrating ever assembled on the tortured subject of American identity  —   accompany images from old talk shows and news reports, from classic movies and from our own decidedly    present. Baldwin could not have known about Ferguson and Black Lives Matter, about the presidency of Barack Obama and the recrudescence of white nationalism in its wake, but in a sense he explained it all in advance. He understood the deep, contradictory patterns of our history, and articulated, with a passion and clarity that few others have matched, the psychological dimensions of racial conflict: the suppression of black humanity under slavery and Jim Crow and the insistence on it in   politics and art the dialectic of guilt and rage, forgiveness and denial that distorts relations between black and white citizens in the North as well as the South the lengths that white people will go to wash themselves clean of their complicity in oppression. Baldwin is a double character in Mr. Peck’s film. The elegance and gravity of his formal prose, and the gravelly authority of Mr. Jackson’s voice, stand in contrast to his quicksilver   presence as a lecturer and television guest. In his skinny tie and narrow suit, an omnipresent cigarette between his fingers, he imports a touch of midcentury intellectual cool into our overheated,   media moment. A former child preacher, he remained a natural, if somewhat reluctant, performer  —   a master of the heavy sigh, the raised eyebrow and the rhetorical flourish. At one point, on “The Dick Cavett Show,” Baldwin tangles with Paul Weiss, a Yale philosophy professor who scolds him for dwelling so much on racial issues. The initial spectacle of mediocrity condescending to genius is painful, but the subsequent triumph of   brilliance over credentialed ignorance is thrilling to witness. In that exchange, as in a speech for an audience of British university students, you are aware of Baldwin’s profound weariness. He must explain himself  —   and also his country  —   again and again, with what must have been sorely tested patience. When the students erupt in a standing ovation at the end of his remarks, Baldwin looks surprised, even flustered. You glimpse an aspect of his personality that was often evident in his writing: the vulnerable, bright, ambitious man thrust into a public role that was not always comfortable. “I want to be an honest man and a good writer,” he wrote early in his career, in the introductory note to his first collection of essays, “Notes of a Native Son. ” The disarming, intimate candor of that statement characterized much of what would follow, as would a reckoning with the difficulties of living up to such apparently straightforward aspirations. Without sliding into confessional bathos, his voice was always personal and frank, creating in the reader a feeling of complicity, of shared knowledge and knowing humor. “I Am Not Your Negro” reproduces and redoubles this effect. It doesn’t just make you aware of Baldwin, or hold him up as a figure to be admired from a distance. You feel entirely in his presence, hanging on his every word, following the implications of his ideas as they travel from his experience to yours. At the end of the movie, you are convinced that you know him. And, more important, that he knows you. To read Baldwin is to be read by him, to feel the glow of his affection, the sting of his scorn, the weight of his disappointment, the gift of his trust. Recounting his visits to the South, where he reported on the civil rights movement and the murderous white response to it, Baldwin modestly described himself as a witness, a watchful presence on the sidelines of tragedy and heroism, an outsider by virtue of his Northern origins, his sexuality and his alienation from the Christianity of his childhood. But he was also a prophet, able to see the truths revealed by the contingent, complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict. This is not to say that he transcended the struggle or detached himself from it. On the contrary, he demonstrated that writing well and thinking clearly are manifestations of commitment, and that irony, skepticism and a ruthless critical spirit are necessary tools for effective moral and political action. “I Am Not Your Negro” is a thrilling introduction to his work, a remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics  —   a concise, roughly   movie with the scope and impact of a     or a literary doorstop. It is not an easy or a consoling movie, but it is the opposite of bitter or despairing. “I can’t be a pessimist because I’m alive,” Baldwin said. “I’m forced to be an optimist. ”"
