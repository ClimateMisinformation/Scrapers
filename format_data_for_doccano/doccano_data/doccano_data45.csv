"The emissions reduction fund, which is at the heart of the Morrison government’s climate change policy, could be used to help pay for an upgrade at a 40-year-old coal-fired power plant after its owners successfully applied to register under the scheme. In a step that underscores the political divide over emissions policy, Vales Point power station in New South Wales was registered in August for a proposal to improve some of its turbines. It is the first stage in it being allowed to bid against land owners and other businesses for climate funding.  The Coalition has indicated it is considering tipping more into the fund, which started with $2.55bn but is now near empty, before this year’s election. The fund has so far failed to curb national emissions, which have increased each year since the government abolished a carbon pricing scheme in 2014. The Australian Conservation Foundation said it was shocking that taxpayers’ money meant to combat climate change could go to coal power plants. “No government should be propping up ailing coal generators with public funds, especially as any major capital works would help extend the life of a plant that should be retired,” said ACF chief executive Kelly O’Shanassy. “Vales Point getting even this far in the process is a clear sign the emissions reduction fund needs structural reform before any new injection of cash is considered.” Sunset Power International bought Vales Point from the NSW government for $1m in 2015. Two years later it was re-valued at $730m and last year it reported a net profit of $113m. Its part-owner, coal power advocate and former National Party candidate Trevor St Baker, has flagged extending its operation beyond its expected closure date of 2029 to 2049. Managing director Greg Everett said prolonging the plant’s life was a $400m decision and had nothing to do with its pitch into the emissions reduction fund. Everett said that project – replacing components on two units commissioned in 1978 – would cost $14.2m and cut emissions by 900,000 tonnes over the decade to 2029. Based on its current emissions of 6.9m tonnes a year, this is a 1.3% cut below what it would be expected to emit. He said the company’s initial bid would be for about $600,000 to pay for an emissions reduction of 50,000 tonnes. But the proposal has stalled due to a disagreement with the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the fund, over whether the project needs to push the plant’s emissions intensity – how much it emits per unit of electricity generated – below the grid average. This shift is necessary for it to bid for funding. Everett said that condition should not apply as the project would upgrade only a small part of the plant. He said the fund’s guidelines included coal power as being able to receive carbon credits. The methodology that covers the plant is being reviewed by an independent emissions reduction assurance committee. Everett rejected suggestions Vales Point should not be eligible for climate funding. He said it played an important role in the grid alongside variable renewable energy. “They try to make out like it’s either/or when in reality a lot of these technologies work together to ensure a secure system,” he said. “The benefit to the community is this is low-cost emissions reduction.” The push for climate funding coincides with St Baker asking the government to underwrite a $6bn plan with a Chinese partner to build three new coal-fired plants in Victoria and NSW, including a new generator next to Vales Point. The centrepiece of Tony Abbott’s “direct action” climate policy, the fund has been gradually whittled down and was not expected to be revived until the government abandoned its national energy guarantee policy and it became clear that voter concern about climate change was likely to play a significant role at this election. The cash is distributed through reverse auctions, with the cheapest cuts proposed winning contracts and the right to generate carbon credits. The government buys credits back once the cuts are verified. To date, the fund has paid out $476m, committed another $1.8bn and has $226m left unspent. Last year a Guardian Australia investigation found it was often difficult to determine if the fund was offering value for money. Some projects were clearly not. The independent assurance committee found landfill sites that capture and burn leaking methane to generate electricity, for instance, would have existed without the fund’s support. Asked whether the fund should be used for coal plants, a spokesman for environment minister Melissa Price said it was technology neutral and its methods required emissions cuts to be genuine. For Vales Point, upgrades to essential components must lower emissions intensity below the grid average to receive carbon credits. Opposition climate spokesman Mark Butler said the fund was ineffective. “As Malcolm Turnbull famously said at the time, it is a fig-leaf to cover a determination to do nothing,” he said. Greens climate spokesman Adam Bandt said it should be abolished with the money redirected to storage, renewable energy zones and a “proper carbon farming initiative”."

"Polar bears prowling around a children’s playground. Polar bears lumbering along the corridors of apartment blocks and offices. Polar bears descending on a sleepy Russian town in their dozens. To state the obvious: polar bears should not be wandering into human habitation, and certainly not in these numbers. That they are doing so in Belushya Guba shows how they are being driven off their normal migration routes and hunting trails by a changing climate. This has long been predicted – with the Arctic heating twice as fast as the rest of the planet, winter temperatures are rising and the sea ice – which is the primary habitat of polar bears – is shrinking. In this small town in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, authorities have declared a state of emergency (a reasonable precaution after spotting an unprecedented 52 polar bears). Fences have been erected around school playgrounds and locals have tried to drive them away with warning shots and explosions. All to no avail. Many residents are afraid to leave their homes. Workers are reportedly being bused to their offices in military vehicles. No other animal symbolises global warming like the polar bear. Over the past three decades, we have grown used to images of malnourished or solitary animals cast adrift on broken ice. But this time it’s different. There is a pack instead of a solitary beast, humanity is near rather than distant and the mood is not just of pity but fear – entirely fitting for a period in which the climate crisis suddenly feels as if it is upon us rather than a future threat. It also highlights other problems of the Anthropocene – the name that scientists have given to our geological era, which is being shaped less and less by natural forces and more and more by human behaviour. Belushya Guba is remote but far from pristine. The nearby seas have recently seen the first commercial offshore oil development in the Arctic. Poor waste management in this region – once the site of Soviet nuclear bomb tests and still with a heavy military presence – has attracted hungry animals to dumpsites. The bears are obviously not environment vigilantes out for revenge. Humans are everywhere. They have nowhere else to go. But many headlines talk of an “invasion” and articles debate the need for “deportation” or execution. The echo of the refugee crisis is no accident. More and more species, along with people, are being driven from their homes by climate disruption, raising the risk of conflict. How to respond to this emergency is also shaped by the usual political divide: the right focus on the immediate threat to human individuals, while the left tries to understand the long-term global causes. But a debate about whether the bear migration should inspire fear or sympathy misses the point. The animals are losing the winter they depend on. Ultimately, so are we. We should feel sorry and afraid both for them and for us."

"The people of Townsville know about heavy rain, but this was new. Over the past fortnight, the northern Queensland city’s 180,000 residents have been hit by a monsoon strengthened by a low-pressure front that dragged moist air south from the equator to Australia’s top end. It dumped an unprecedented 1.4 metres of rain in less than two weeks – roughly double what falls on London in a year.  The ensuing chaos has wrecked homes and caused hundreds of millions of dollars of damage to property. Two men have drowned and videos posted to social media have shown crocodiles climbing trees and taking to elevated highways in search of shelter. But amid the deluge, not everyone heeded the evacuation advice. Mark Parison was one of those who stayed. The tide where he lives in Hermit Park peaked at least two metres high on some homes and the road was decorated with debris – furniture, white goods and children’s toys – pulled from homes as the water receded. But Parison’s traditional Queenslander home, elevated on concrete pillars, remained largely intact. As he moved piles of damaged property to the roadside for local authorities to collect, he told Guardian Australia why he ignored the advice to run. “It was a scary old night [but] this house has been here for a long time. We decided … it’s been here that long, it’s been through some big floods,” he said. Asked if he was concerned that climate change was making floods more extreme, he was clear: “If anyone mentions that, I’ll punch ‘em.” “The weather events seem to be getting more extreme. Whether it’s manmade or natural or who knows. “These people crying about climate change, they’ve got to look at how they live themselves. They’re still driving around in cars, they’re still wearing nice clothes. They’re using mobile phones. So give that up, I’ll start listening to you. “City people are stalling us. We need the economy here to be boosted.” In a city with nearly one in ten unemployed his view holds purchase. And so goes some of the public debate in Australia about the impact of rising greenhouse gas emissions. The north Queensland flooding is far from the only punishing event in what has been, even by the standards of the continent, a historically hostile summer. Internal polling for political parties and environment groups suggests Australians are increasingly concerned that this is linked to climate change and want to see action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a priority at this year’s federal election. It matches public polling that has found a comfortable majority accept it is a significant problem that needs to be addressed. But after a decade of political fights and ideological warfare, discussion on the subject is often still a combat zone. The Coalition government would prefer not to talk about it at all. Australia is, of course, no stranger to extreme weather - bushfire, flooding, rains and skin-peeling heat are central to its history and mythology - but the contrasts this southern summer have been particularly stark. Lesley Hughes, a professor of biology at Macquarie University and councillor with publicly funded communication body the Climate Council, says few parts of the continent have not experienced an extreme weather event in recent months. More than 3000 kilometres to Townsville’s south, Tasmania is burning. For the second time in four years, dry lightning strikes sparked a series of blazes on the usually cool, temperate island, many of them in the vast world heritage wilderness area that covers nearly half its territory. In one 30-hour period in mid-January, an extended electrical storm danced across the summer sky, sending down more than 2400 lightning strikes without rain. About 200,000 hectares - 3% of the state’s surface - has been burned, including unique alpine heath landscapes that had not been touched by fire for centuries. The fires are expected to burn for another month at least. Hundreds of people, many of them from in and around the southern town of Geeveston, spent the best part of two weeks camping at evacuation centres. Six homes were destroyed before rain late in the week reduced the threat to communities. Elsewhere, communities in the sparsely populated Australian outback continue to deal with the fallout from a long-term drought. On social media, a Greens MP in New South Wales, David Shoebridge, highlighted a constituent forced to pay $70 a week on drinking water for her and her son after the raw water supply in the town of Walgett was turned off. A political battle is also raging over the use of water in the vast Murray-Darling river system that fans across the country’s eastern state agricultural districts, with drought-afflicted downstream communities arguing they are being denied water by a national river plan that did not factor in climate change and has been designed to keep dams full at water-hungry industrial agriculture sites in northern states. This claim has been backed by a royal commission convened by the state of South Australia, which lies at the end of the river system, and the continuing disaster of up to a million fish having perished in three mass kills in the west of New South Wales due to water deoxygenation, with more deaths predicted. The sense of a country playing extreme weather bingo has heightened as flood and drought collided this week, requiring the defence force to be called in to distribute fodder to cattle that had suddenly found their long-parched home under water. By Friday, it was clear that up to 300,000 cattle had been killed in the floods. With evidence mounting that authorities were unprepared for the extent of the rainfall, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, announced an independent inquiry. For most, the most obvious extreme weather shift has been the heat. January was Australia’s hottest month on record by a wide margin, with average national temperatures nearly a degree beyond the previous benchmark and 2.9 degrees warmer than the long-term mean. In New South Wales, the average temperature was nearly 6 degrees hotter than what has been considered normal for the past century. Blair Trewin, senior climatologist with the Bureau of Meteorology, says: “Even taking into account the sustained long-term warming trend of a degree or so over a century, this is certainly at the far end of expectations.” It is the heat that seems to be shifting public concern about climate change. Political polling suggests it is registering in the top two or three issues of concern for voters in a way it has not since the 2007 election, when the country was enduring a decade long drought, if not ever. The trend is headed in this direction even in some outer suburban electorates, which have traditionally been more driven by jobs and cost-of-living issues. But the shift is not universal. The government is hearing similar messages, but there has been no change in messaging from prime minister Scott Morrison. He visited the Tasmanian fires and Queensland floods within a 24-hour period, speaking with people who had been forced to flee their homes, thanking emergency service workers and, in Townsville, was photographed climbing into a tank. He drew no link between the extreme weather and emissions in his public comments and he dismissed as a stunt a suggestion by the Greens that he should apologise for backing coal given there was evidence it was making natural disasters worse. The Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, went a step further while visiting the site of the Menindee Lake mass fish kill, choosing language that suggested outright scepticism about climate science. “We are looking at climate, of course, (but) climate has been changing since year dot,” he said, before adding: “We don’t want to go down a path of renewables, which is not going to solve anything apart from de-industrialising Australia and making sure we don’t do manufacturing here and pushing electricity bills into the unaffordable state.” While concern about climate change is growing, there is evidence this position retains support – Essential Media polling late last year, for instance, suggested a slim majority of voters may back public financial support for a new coal power development than would oppose it, though more than quarter said they did not know what they thought. The suggestion governments may force coal industries to close are particularly challenging issues in Townsville, which is the centre of support for the Carmichael coalmine, the long-stalled greenfield project proposed by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani that has become a proxy for debate over climate change. The mining industry posits itself as a jobs saviour. But, as always, views are split. Katie McGrath was among the lucky ones in the Queensland floods, having got caught up and seeing her car in a metre of water. A social worker who works in Townsville but lives on nearby Magnetic Island, she had not realised how great the threat was before getting into trouble. “I’ve never seen the island flood like this before,” she said. McGrath has little doubt that what Townsville has been experiencing is part of a bigger picture, but acknowledges she is out of step with many in her community. “There’s clearly things happening around the world that are alarming,” she says. “It’s like anything, if you don’t know enough about it then you seek advice from experts, and what they’re telling us is that we’ve got a real problem with climate change and we need to do something about it.” But despite the experts, Townsville is the epicentre of support for the Adani coalmine. For every flood affected resident who is concerned about climate change, several others share Parison’s views. Roughly one in 10 people in Townsville are unemployed. About 16% of the population is university educated, compared with 22% Australia wide. People want economic growth and employment opportunities. And, for all the boom and bust cycles places such as Townsville have endured in the past, the mining industry still posits itself as a jobs saviour. But McGrath believes adequate communication about the opportunities that come with a cleaner economy is missing. “For those people, work’s been hard to come by for a while and that’s been a real issue for people in Townsville,” she said. “There’s not really been much put forward, and this region is really dependent on mining. People want to see jobs in mining, they want to see Adani go ahead. That’s the priority for people at the moment. Whether they agree with climate change, care about it or whatever, that’s a secondary priority to making ends meet now. “I don’t necessarily think people are addicted to coal, or think that coal’s great. We haven’t been offered different information or alternatives about different jobs that are available. At the moment that’s not there.” Her observations underline the challenge in some parts of the country for the Labor party, which is favoured to win the election with a platform of taking climate change seriously, but beyond the electricity sector is yet to explain what meeting its more ambitious greenhouse targets would mean. Part of the challenge of communicating climate change is explaining the science, particularly the extent to which any extreme event can be linked to increasing emissions. Attribution science is a rapidly evolving field. Lesley Hughes, who helped launch a Climate Council report called Weather Gone Wild, says emissions are effectively loading the dice to increase the likelihood of an extreme weather event. “What we are now observing is consistent with the climate science – as the Earth warms up, more extreme weather is inevitable,” she says. In the case of the floods, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, which in the event of a storm can mean heavier rain in a shorter space of time. In the case of the Tasmanian fires, not only has the state become warmer (2.5 degrees above average in January) but low-pressure weather patterns that used to produce rain over the state have also moved further south as the climate has warmed, and evaporation rates have increased. Both increase the risk of dry lightning strike causing a blaze. Hobart, the Tasmanian capital, recorded just 0.4 millimetres of rain in January, the lowest on record. Hughes says governments can obfuscate for only so long before publicly accepting that climate change is now both a mitigation and adaptation challenge. Failing to acknowledge the role humans are playing is holding back conversations about, for instance, whether Australia needs to invest in fire-fighting aircraft rather than sharing with the US, given the northern and southern fire seasons are increasingly overlapping. “The prime minister is still pandering to the right-wing sceptics in his party by not talking about climate change. But arguing black is white doesn’t make it so,” she says. “The government has to accept these events are going to get worse over the next few decades and plan accordingly – both to adapt and to be part of the solution instead of the problem.”"
"Some wore school uniform, with ties askew in St Trinian’s fashion, others donned face paint, sparkly jackets and DM boots. The youngest clutched a parent’s hand as people gathered in the sunshine in Parliament Square in London, a few metres from the politicians they say are letting down a generation. They carried homemade placards, with slogans full of humour, passion and hope that the voices of thousands of children and young people would be heard. “March now – or swim later”, “I’ve seen smarter cabinets in Ikea” and “denial is not a policy” read the banners, as chants for action on climate change grew and strengthened with the passing hours into a deafening roar. “What do we want? Climate action! When do we want it? Now!” Across the UK it was a day for thousands who are not normally heard, as children took time out of their lessons to attend the strike. “As students we don’t have the vote, and it is really unfair because this is going to impact on us the most. It is our future,” said Evie Baldwin, 15, from north London. In Manchester, the students came with handwritten notes from their parents giving authorisation for their photos to be taken, and bullet points to explain why they felt compelled to strike. There was a party atmosphere outside the central library, as students played Where is the Love? by the Black Eyed Peas and I Want It That Way by the Backstreet Boys. They cheered as a band played Joni Mitchell’s Big Yellow Taxi, with its ecological refrain: “Don’t it always seem to go, that you don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone/They paved paradise, put up a parking lot.” Lillia Adetoro, nine, told Manchester demonstrators: “Scientists across Europe say we have 12 years to get this right. The technology is there. The solutions are there. Brilliant minds across the world have been working on this for decades. And what they have said has been ignored.” Children who had been told not to miss school defiantly attended the rallies anyway. Ten-year-old Hettie Ainsworth, in Brighton, had not been given permission by her primary school to join the protest, but such was her passion that her parents let her attend anyway. To her, the issue was personal. She said: “The government isn’t doing enough about it. It’s important because it’s our future and if we don’t start paying attention to climate change, there may not be one.” There was a range of age groups present, from people in their 60s, to children as young as four and five, running around in superhero costumes. Swedish 15-year-old Greta Thunberg was frequently cited as an inspiration by adults and children. One group called Fridays for Future Manchester, which has been meeting outside the library every week for more than two months, stood with a banner painted with Thunberg’s face on it. Protesters from Extinction Rebellion and Campaign against Climate Change were also present. Similar crowds were seen across the north of England, with organisers assembling in Leeds, Newcastle and Sheffield. Magid Magid, Sheffield’s lord mayor, who banned Donald Trump from visiting the city last year, said there was no better time to march than now. He said: “It’s as simple as action or extinction … [These students] come across as the fearless advocates in the face of those who have stopped caring about [the climate crisis]. They are literally saving our bloody planet.” At the clock tower in the centre of Brighton, hundreds of primary, secondary and university students gathered.  As they marched towards the Level park, the crowd swelled. According to organiser Mary-Jane Farrell, more than 1,000 people were in attendance. While adults and supportive parents followed, teenagers in school uniform marched at the front of the crowd, shouting, among other things: “Greens in, blues out” and “Fuck the Tories”. The procession blocked traffic on Brighton’s main roads, and onlookers clapped and took photos as people passed through. Joe Paugler, 16, left his school during break time to join the march. He said he felt the need to raise awareness. “They don’t discuss climate change as much as they should in politics, probably because there’s no money in it,” he said. Critics of the strike had suggested some students would use the strike as an opportunity to skip school, but most children seemed more excited by the prospect of attending their first protest. At Level park, crowds cheered for several of the day’s speakers, but the loudest applause was undeniably for the local Green party MP, Caroline Lucas. Surrounded by children vying to get a selfie with her, she said today marked a real turning point. “It’s children’s futures at stake, and frankly our generation has let them down and certainly the politicians at Westminster have let them down,” she said. Hundreds of young people gathered across Glasgow, cheered on by MSP Ross Greer, who tweeted: “Just look at these incredible young women, who can’t be older than 13/14, taking action to save the world and their future.” In London, there were more than 1,000 in attendance by lunchtime. Among them was former Labour leader Ed Miliband with his nine-year-old son, Daniel. “I am here because it is our future, and we need to protect it,” said Daniel. The size of the demonstration took the police by surprise. “I don’t know how many are here, but it’s a lot – much more than we expected,” said one officer. Several hours in, what had begun as a rally outside the House of Commons turned into a spontaneous running march on Downing Street, as hundreds of teenagers, sprinted along Whitehall to chant their message outside No 10. As they surged down the road, buses, trucks and taxis, were forced to stop. “Honk your horn,” the teenagers shouted, to blasts from scores of drivers. Other groups broke away from the main crowd to sit down in the road, forcing Westminster traffic into gridlock for more than two hours. Holding hands, they refused to be moved, as the police deployed mounted officers in an attempt to move them back into Parliament Square. One officer successfully lifted 15-year-old Alex Cooper off the road – only for her to continue her seated protest moments later. “This is a great turnout,” she said. “We need the government to listen.” Across the street, among those watching from the sidelines, one woman said: “My 13-year-old daughter is in there somewhere. I am so proud of her.”"
"Last week, the journal Biological Conservation published an article that, while perhaps methodologically limited, made a credible case that the worldwide disappearance of insects foreshadowed a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”. But the scariest aspect didn’t receive sufficient attention.  The scientists don’t attribute the extinctions primarily to climate change. They blame multiple causes, particularly habitat loss, pollution and pesticides. In other words, the climate emergency on which most of us have been focused must be understood as one aspect of a broader disaster pertaining to humanity’s relationship to nature. How will politicians respond? After last week’s parliamentary clown show, many commentators justly bemoaned the low standard of leadership in Australia, with some urging a return to the centrist stability of the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments. Yet that comparison actually reveals the deeper issues underpinning today’s political dysfunction. Bob Hawke won office in 1983 after heading the ACTU, a body that then represented more than half the workforce. He promised unionists an increased standard of living through a “social wage”; he convinced employers he’d restrain labour militancy. His Accord gave Labor a real base and thus the stability to implement a neoliberal program that, at the time, no conservative politician would have dared advocate. John Howard, by contrast, intensified neoliberal reform via a full-frontal assault on a labour movement weakened by the Accord and increasingly resented by capital. He thus united neoliberals and social conservatives behind big business and against the unions. The situation today could not be more different. Since Howard’s defeat, tension between Liberal wets and dries has become endemic, with Scott Morrison merely the latest leader tilting from one faction to the other according to the shifting political winds. The chaos reflects not the failure of individual politicians but an inability to present a coherent political project behind which the right’s traditional support base might be mobilised. Similarly, Hawke won power with an astonishing 78% approval rating, while the latest polls put Shorten at an equally remarkable negative 15. Again, that’s not a personal flaw but indicative of a deeper uncertainty about who and what Labor represents, given its declining links to its traditional constituency. In 1983, Hawke convinced organised labour to back an Accord meant to transform the economy on workers’ behalf. In 2019, with the union movement greatly diminished, Shorten offers at best tepid support to the ACTU’s Change the Rules campaign. The ALP’s likely victory in the next election thus reflects public disdain for the Liberals rather than enthusiasm for a Labor project. We’re set for a familiar pattern: an unpopular leader with no real agenda or mandate, fending off internal challenges, and reliant on culture war and media stunts to beat back the opposition. The absence of a stable social base leaves governments without the authority to tackle difficult issues. The parliamentary convulsions accompanying the medevac bill provide an obvious example, with asylum seeker policy still based on piecemeal, ad hoc expedients slung together in response to an immediate crisis and then retained indefinitely in lieu of anything better. Yes, the politics of borders are complicated. But they don’t present nearly as much of a challenge as the environmental situation. We know that the biggest threat to insect populations comes from industrial farming. The advanced economies increasingly rely on unsustainable agricultural techniques, intensive use of pesticide and fertiliser, and the systematic clearance of forests, so much so that experts attribute about two-thirds of the loss of wildlife to food manufacture. Furthermore, according to the World Resources Food Institute, production must rise by half in the next 30 years just sustain the growing world’s population. In other words, any meaningful response to “insectageddon” requires fundamental changes in agriculture and thus the world economy – even as we address the separate but related problem of climate change. Can you imagine a single contemporary politician putting forward a program for that? Think of the agonised process that eventually resulted in marriage reform. Equality required merely a simple (and overwhelmingly popular) legislative change. And yet successive parliaments tied themselves in knots failing to deliver it – until a public campaign delivered the extra-parliamentary yes vote that broke the deadlock. Indeed, the popular mobilisation for marriage reform hints at the only way out of the mess that we’re in. Even if parliamentarians wanted to address the environmental emergency (and clearly many of them don’t), they no longer possess the kind of support base to deliver radical change. That’s why, as the school students leading climate strikes have realised, we need to build our own constituency for action, creating the kind of mass movement that makes change impossible – even for politicians – to resist. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"Adam Watson, who has died aged 88, honed his exemplary skills as a field scientist and conservationist on the snowy and windswept tops of the Cairngorms, in the eastern Highlands of Scotland.  Obsessive, authoritative, energetic and compelling in his approach, he spent decades in scholarly observations on nature and natural phenomena in mountain environments. Studying birds and mammals, soil erosion and snow patches, and developing unrivalled datasets on longterm changes in nature, Adam amassed a treasure trove of vital information on the impacts of climate change and human land use.   By the mid-1960s he had written classic papers on mountain bird behaviour and ecology, and as recently as autumn 2018 he published a seven-decade study of mountain hare population declines in north-east Scotland. He also established Europe’s longest-running study of golden eagles. Aged seven, Adam had developed a fascination for snow, and in the Guardian 10 years ago he described how “I could see these pale veils coming out of the sky, and as it got near the ground I saw they were actually snowflakes.” Influenced by the naturalist Seton Gordon, young Adam took notes on the occurrence of mountain “snow patches”, and by 14 was keeping a diary of snow events. This developed in the 40s into systematic monitoring of long-lasting snow patches in the Cairngorms, which continues to this day, with annual reports for the Royal Meteorological Society, in collaboration with the snow expert Iain Cameron. This gives a unique record of climate influences across Scotland’s highest mountains. His research on the elusive ptarmigan, one of the world’s hardiest birds, involved Adam ascending Scotland’s highest mountains each day, often consecutively, over several weeks, for 73 years from 1943. Sheltering in bivouacs, he would survey the summit plateaux and boulder fields, sometimes with pointer dogs, for every nesting bird, in order to develop an accurate population estimate, recording numbers, breeding success and habitat use. Born in Turriff, Aberdeenshire, Adam was the son of Adam Watson, a solicitor as well as a fine naturalist, and his wife, Margaret (nee Rae). He went to the Turriff schools (and was dux in both), then took a degree in zoology at Aberdeen University, graduating with first-class honours in 1952, having studied ptarmigan winter ecology for his honoursproject. The explorer Col Pat Baird, having met Adam on Derry Cairngorm, invited him as his zoologist on an expedition to Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic the following year. Adam subsequently returned to the island on a Carnegie Arctic scholarship, and took his PhD in 1956 on the annual cycle of the ptarmigan.  The following year he joined the UK government’s Nature Conservancy unit of grouse and moorland ecology to study population changes in red grouse. Building on the 1911 Lord Lovat report on red grouse population fluctuations, Adam and his team led a new study in the north-east Scotland heartland of grouse moors. His Collins New Naturalist book Grouse (2008), co-written with a colleague, Robert Moss, provides the detailed findings.  He continued to work in north-east Scotland for the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (now Centre for Ecology and Hydrology), even after retirement in 1990, when he was made an emeritus fellow. Adam’s conservation activism was sparked by two threats. The prospect of a major skiing development in the northern corries of the Cairngorms in the early 80s galvanised his study of human-related disturbance, in contrast to extreme weather-related impacts on mountain soil and wildlife. His research featured prominently in the Lurchers Gully public inquiry in 1981, which essentially redefined the nature of further ski developments in Scotland.  The unstinting persecution of birds of prey on grouse moors was also intolerable for Adam. His record of golden eagle territories, with some suffering from interference each year since the 1940s, increased his outrage at the victimisation of these and other birds of prey. An outstanding mountaineer, climber and cross-country skier (the first person to ski-tour the six tops of the Cairngorms in a day, in 1962), Adam checked most of the cliff routes in the Scottish Mountaineering Club’s climbers’ guide, The Cairngorms, revised it in 1968, rewrote it in 1975, and repeatedly updated further editions. His north-east Scots burr, heard frequently on TV and radio shows such as Radio 4’s The Living World, concealed a scholarly mastery of Deeside Gaelic, which was to the fore in his textbook The Place Names of Upper Deeside (1984). Adam had a fascination for landmarks and features that each had a local name, and through talking endlessly with local people in Gaelic, he developed an encyclopedic knowledge of the cultural roots of the Cairngorms landscape. A scourge of what he termed “establishment” thinking and practices, Adam was vehemently condemnatory of anyone who did not conform to his understanding of nature, and unsparing in his criticism of traditional land managers and scientific competitors, regardless of their pedigree. Having published more than 30 books, and 600 papers and reports, Adam was possibly the most widely published ecologist in Europe. A fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1971), Royal Society of Biology (1980) and Royal Meteorological Society (2009), and of many international bodies, Adam held four doctorates and received several awards, including the John Muir Trust’s lifetime achievement award (2005). His portrait hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Adam met Jenny Raitt in 1954, when she worked as a secretary to the agricultural statistician David Finney at Aberdeen University. He was studying in the nearby department of natural history and, following a “hillwalking courtship”, they married in 1955 in Aberdeen, and in 1962 settled in Crathes, near Banchory, south of the city.  Jenny died in 2016. Adam is survived by their daughter, Jenny, son, Adam, and two granddaughters. • Adam Watson, ecologist and mountaineer, born 14 April 1930; died 24 January 2019"
"Until recently, Holly Gillibrand was like any other schoolchild, keen on the outdoors, football and rock climbing, inspired by the stunning surroundings of her secondary school at the foot of Ben Nevis. But for the past five Fridays, while hundreds of her fellow students file into class, she has stood outside Lochaber high school in Fort William in the Highlands to take strike action.  Her protest is not for better classrooms, nicer meals or more free time. Holly, 13, is helping to build a UK movement of children demanding more action on climate change by withdrawing themselves from the lessons they are legally required to attend. They are working towards a UK school strike next Friday, which will follow other walkouts by tens of thousands of children across Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Australia. Holly was inspired by the actions of Greta Thunberg, who in September sat outside the Swedish parliament for three weeks on “school strike”. International interest in her story led to Thunberg going to Davos last month to address world leaders. While she travelled for 32 hours on trains to reach the ski resort, political and business leaders hired 1,500 private jets to get to the summit. Holly said: “I saw on social media that she was sitting outside the parliament, and then lots of other children started doing similar things and I thought, that is something I could do to make a difference. I thought she was brave and inspirational.” Each week, Holly and a small group of supporters carry placards with slogans such as “School strike for the climate”, “Beep for climate action” and “Striking for the seas – stop global warming now”, and take time out of classes to demand action. “It’s the first time I have done anything like this,” she said. “But I feel very angry, very scared and I see that they [political leaders] are not taking climate change seriously. It is an urgent crisis that needs to be addressed.” Holly has tried to make changes to reduce her carbon footprint and insisted the Guardian did not send a photographer to drive two hours from Glasgow to take her portrait. “I take the bus, I am almost completely vegan, as are my parents, and my family has always been very environmentally aware,” she said. Taking time out of school is a powerful weapon, Holly believes, to draw attention to the need to act more decisively to tackle climate change. “I am not sure how my headteacher feels, but my class teachers have been very supportive,” she said. “I have had lots of people joining me, although not as many from my school as I hoped, but we are hoping many other children from schools across the country will take action next week.” Across Europe, a pushback from adults – particularly those in power – seems to have begun. The Belgian environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, recently suggested the school strikes were not genuine actions of young people angry and frustrated about the future of their planet, but a “setup” and “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”. Schauvliege claimed Belgium’s intelligence services had information that the children were being directed by unknown groups or individuals. But such was the political backlash, she was forced to resign last week. Holly has gained support globally via social media, where a network of young people are reaching out across national boundaries. She has little time for adults who doubt and criticise her actions. “I say to people who object to us missing lessons, what is the point of studying for a future that if nothing is done, we might not have?” she said. On her first strike day, Holly explained clearly why she was taking the step. “I am striking because we are running out of time. Thousands of children around the world should not be having to miss classes because of our leaders’ inability to treat the climate crisis as a crisis,” she said. Over the past few weeks, she has featured in Scottish media and been recruited as an environment columnist for the Lochaber Times. And her sense of urgency and passion has only increased. As the school strike message continues to spread across the globe, Holly says she is determined to follow Thunberg’s lead. “Greta Thunberg, thank you for leading the way,” she said in a tweet. “You are right – with action does come hope.”"
"It started with a solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg and has snowballed across the globe. Schoolchildren demanding action on climate change have played truant and taken to the streets in Australia, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and, in their greatest numbers, in Belgium, where 35,000 made their voices heard in Brussels a week ago and a further 12,500 marched on Thursday.  But in the Netherlands, where half the country is below sea level and awareness of global warming is high, there have been no such demonstrations. And for the first march, planned for Thursday in The Hague, organisers say they hope for a rather modest turnout of about 3,000. “The commitment of Belgian youth seems to be greater than that of Dutch young people,” said the Dutch newspaper Trouw on Friday. “Why?” Certainly the attitude of the Dutch government has not been particularly welcoming of the truancy movement. The country’s education minister, Arie Slob, while welcoming the enthusiasm for saving the world, suggested those who wished to make their point should do so on the weekend. “Education is education and we are not going to give way to truancy,” he told the current affairs show Nieuwsuur this week.  Fearing the prospect of mass truancy, some schools have also taken a hard line. Heleen Klootwijk at Herbert Vissers College in Nieuw-Vennep spoke for many by warning that students who went to The Hague demonstration next Thursday would be listed as truanting “with accompanying consequences”. But while encouraging students to make their voices heard, the Dutch MEP Sophia in ‘t Veld suggested there may be a cultural reason for Dutch teenagers’ apparent reticence. In report after report, the Netherlands tops OECD countries for high life satisfaction among its young people, partly because they already have the ear of their elders. “It’s a different tradition, I suppose,” In ‘t Veld said. “It doesn’t always work but there is a relationship between the government and the social partners. The government could reform the pensions today from above but they won’t. They will talk with the stakeholders. The children live with that different experience. In Belgium and France it is more top down – and people turn to the streets.” The difference in approach has certainly been notable in the attitudes of some senior politicians in Flanders, where the Youth for Climate movement first emerged in Belgium. Bart De Wever, the chairman of the Flemish nationalist party the New Flemish Alliance, which was until recently in government as part of a coalition, urged the young protesters “not to believe in the apocalypse” but to go back to their books and have “confidence in the future and in the power of innovation”. “We will not solve anything with green taxes and making people feel guilty,” he said. His colleague, the former secretary of state for migration Theo Francken, tweeted: “Dad, where’s my cell phone? Gone! When are we going to ski? Never again. Where will we go this summer? Home. Is the power on? … Put on sweater. Are you taking me to football? Pack your bike. Dad, why are you doing this? Sorry kid, you convinced me that it should be different.” But this week the Belgian students launched an online platform to collect ideas for tackling global warming, and they say they will keep on skipping school until their message is heard."
"The gathering storm of human-caused threats to climate, nature and economy pose a danger of systemic collapse comparable to the 2008 financial crisis, according to a new report that calls for urgent and radical reform to protect political and social systems. The study says the combination of global warming, soil infertility, pollinator loss, chemical leaching and ocean acidification is creating a “new domain of risk”, which is hugely underestimated by policymakers even though it may pose the greatest threat in human history. “A new, highly complex and destabilised ‘domain of risk’ is emerging – which includes the risk of the collapse of key social and economic systems, at local and potentially even global levels,” warns the paper from the Institute for Public Policy Research. “This new risk domain affects virtually all areas of policy and politics, and it is doubtful that societies around the world are adequately prepared to manage this risk.” Until recently, most studies of environmental risk tended to examine threats in isolation: climate scientists examined disruption to weather systems, biologists focused on ecosystem loss and economists calculated potential damages from intensifying storms and droughts. But a growing body of research is assessing how the interplay of these factors can create a cascade of tipping points in human society as well as the natural world. The new paper – This is a Crisis: Facing up to the Age of Environmental Breakdown – is a meta-study of dozens of academic papers, government documents and NGO reports compiled by IPPR, a leftwing thinktank that is considered an influence on Labour policy. The authors examine how the deterioration of natural infrastructure, such as a stable climate and fertile land, have a knock-on effect on health, wealth, inequality and migration, which in turn heightens the possibility of political tension and conflict. The paper stresses the human impacts go beyond climate change and are occurring at speeds unprecedented in recorded history. Evidence on the deterioration of natural systems is presented with a series of grim global statistics: topsoil is now being lost 10 to 40 times faster than it is being replenished by natural processes; the 20 warmest years since records began in 1850 have been in the past 22 years; vertebrate populations have fallen by an average of 60% since the 1970s, and insect numbers – vital for pollination – have declined even faster in some countries. These processes amplify and interact with existing social and economic problems, potentially threatening systemic collapse similar to the 2008-9 financial crisis. Back then, a subprime mortgage crisis in the US exposed excessive risk-taking and triggered a global panic and the deepest recession since the 1930s. The IPPR study envisages a similar breakdown could occur if the US suffers relentlessly worsening damage from hurricane floods and forest fires, which would prompt a rush of insurance claims and threaten the viability of financial institutions. “In the extreme, environmental breakdown could trigger catastrophic breakdown of human systems, driving a rapid process of ‘runaway collapse’ in which economic, social and political shocks cascade through the globally linked system – in much the same way as occurred in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2007-08,” the paper warns. There are other potential cascades. The paper warns of the vulnerability of food systems that rely on just five animal and 12 plant species to provide 75% of the world’s nutrition. The lack of diversity weakens resilience to the growing risks of climate disruption, soil deterioration, pollution and pollinator loss. Previous research – cited by the IPPR – estimates a one-in-20 chance per decade of a simultaneous failure of maize production in the US and China, which provide 60% of the global supply. Migration is also likely to increase as a result of longer droughts and more extreme heat, particularly in the Middle East and central and northern Africa. Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report, said the climate crisis was likely to create 10 times more refugees from that region than the 12 million who left during the Arab spring. “There would be repercussions in Europe. Rightwing groups use the fear of migration, as we saw during the EU referendum in Britain,” he said. “What is that going to look like when far more people are forced from homes due to environmental shocks? What does that mean for political cohesion.” Several other recent interdisciplinary studies have highlighted the dangers of mutually reinforcing impacts. In December, the authors of a paper published in Science warned the risks were far greater than assumed because 45% of tipping points were interrelated and could amplify one another. Last August, scientists warns these domino effects could push the Earth into an almost uninhabitable “hothouse state”. Studies of financial and social tipping points are scarcer, but concern is growing. Last month, the top three global risks identified by the World Economic Forum were extreme weather, climate policy failure and natural disasters. Water shortages, accelerating biodiversity loss and large-scale involuntary migration also ranked in the top 10. “Of all risks, it is in relation to the environment that the world is most clearly sleepwalking into catastrophe,” its annual risk report warns. “The results of climate inaction are becoming increasingly clear. The accelerating pace of biodiversity loss is a particular concern.” The IPPR report, which launches a wider 18-month project on this topic, urges policymakers to grapple with these risks as a priority, to accelerate the restoration of natural systems, and to push harder on the “green new deal” transition towards renewable energy. In particular, it says, “the younger generations will need help in finding the energy and a sense of control that often eludes them as they begin to realise the enormity of inheriting a rapidly destabilising world”. Wider discussion is the first step, according to Laybourn-Langton, who said he was shocked by the paucity of public debate relative to the scale of the problems. “People are not frank enough about this. If it is discussed at all, it is the sort of thing mentioned at the end of a conversation, that makes everyone look at the floor, but we don’t have time for that now,” he said. “It’s appearing more in media, but we are not doing enough.” • This article was amended on 12 and 28 February 2019. After publication the IPPR issued corrections to their report, which originally said since 2005 the number of floods across the world has increased by 15 times, extreme temperature events by 20 times, and wildfires sevenfold. Those figures were based on a database that did not provide a complete record of natural disasters; those references have been removed from this article."
"A climate scientist and a former government expert in the audience for Donald Trump’s annual address to Congress said this will probably be the last administration that can forgo talking about climate change in the State of the Union speech. Trump did not mention rising temperatures or extreme weather, although he did tout the country’s status as the top producer of oil and gas and boast about how quickly his officials have moved to cut regulations.   Lisa Graumlich, the dean of the environment college at the University of Washington, attended the State of the Union address as a guest of the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. “I have been doing research on climate change since the 1970s, and it always seemed very far away in time and space. It was something that was going to happen when people’s grandchildren were alive. And that has changed,” Graumlich said. “I don’t think that future presidents will find themselves in this position, because people are feeling the effects of climate change.” Joel Clement, who resigned from the interior department because he said the administration was muzzling scientists and ignoring climate change effects on vulnerable communities, now works with the Union of Concerned Scientists. He was invited by the Maine congressman Chellie Pingree. “The Trump administration’s strategy is to ignore climate change and pretend it doesn’t exist and pretend the science doesn’t exist even if it’s coming from its own agencies,” Clement said. “To not say anything about it is just ignorance, and it’s irresponsible.” In 10 years, Clement said, climate change will be central to all policy discussions, as one of the top three or four issues in the world, Clement said. Several other high-profile climate advocates were invited by other Democrats protesting against Trump’s doubts of the science and his rollbacks. The New York congressman Paul Tonko invited the League of Conservation Voters’ Gene Karpinski and the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin brought along 350.org’s Bill McKibben. The Massachusetts senator Ed Markey attended with the head of the youth-led Sunrise Movement, Varshini Prakash, who is calling for a Green New Deal to tackle inequality and quickly cut greenhouse gas emissions. Markey is expected to join Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this week in releasing expanded language on the high-level goals of a Green New Deal. Even the Democratic rebuttal to Trump’s speech, by the ex-Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, only mentioned climate change once, in a list of priorities the US could pursue. However, Bernie Sanders, in his own response speech, noted warnings in reports from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention – not one word – about climate change when the leading scientists of the world tell us that climate change is real, that climate change is caused by human activity, that climate change is already causing devastating harm in the United States,” Sanders said. “Furthermore, the scientists tell us we have a very short, 12 years, not a lot of time in order to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels.” While very little of the primetime speeches focused on climate change, Democrats will hold two hearings in the House on Wednesday about its effects."

"School leaders are having to wrestle with their consciences over pupils joining the nationwide climate strike to be held on Friday afternoon, caught between their duties as teachers and instincts as educators. Thousands of the more than 8 million school pupils in the UK are expected to walk out of lessons to show their concern about the threat of escalating climate change.  Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman and a former science teacher, said she will be joining a rally in Oxford and urged school leaders to accommodate pupils who join the protests. “As a former teacher I absolutely understand the frustrations that teachers and schools may have with these strikes. However, I would describe this as a teachable moment,” said Moran, the MP for Oxford West and Abingdon. “I hope schools, colleges and universities see this in the positive light it is meant and equally hope those students act sensibly with making sure adults know where they are and making up the missed work.” But the National Association of Head Teachers, which last week offered some support for those joining the strike, gave a more hard-headed assessment to its members as the day of the action approached. “Pupils should only be out of school in exceptional circumstances. Whilst NAHT supports the right of young people to express themselves, first and foremost, pupils should be in school during term time,” the union said. “While a school leader’s role is to ensure children attend school, are kept safe and receive a good quality of education, it is right that individual school leaders can decide how best to respond to any proposed protest by students in their school on Friday.” Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said young people were right to be concerned about climate change but warned that teachers had genuine safeguarding issues to consider. “It’s not appropriate for pupils to just walk out of school. The young people organising this are potentially putting themselves and others at risk by simply walking out of school,” Keates said. “Teachers take their responsibility for pupils welfare during the school day seriously and while they may have sympathy for the cause will not be able to condone pupils just walking out. “A well-planned, accessible demonstration of young people at a weekend or during a holiday would enable thousands to participate and be a powerful protest.” The Department for Education’s guidance says unauthorised absences must be recorded as part of safeguarding, but gives room for headteachers to approve absences in “exceptional circumstances”. The organisers have written form letters for the parents of those wanting to take part, which argue that protesting qualifies as civic engagement and climate change is an exceptional circumstance. With the strike taking place on the final day before half-term holidays in many parts of England, some schools may adopt a relaxed attitude. But others have already informed their students any absence will be noted as unauthorised. Geoff Barton, a former secondary school headteacher who now leads the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “While we understand the strength of feeling over the very important issue of climate change, we would urge pupils against walking out of school on Friday. “It is extremely disruptive for a school to have to deal with unauthorised absences and pupils will be missing out on important learning time.” The day of action follows the example of Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old Swedish schoolgirl who began protesting outside her country’s parliament in August. Her solo effort has since grown and spread to countries around the world including Germany and Australia. In a letter to the Guardian, more than 200 UK academics said they offered “full support” to the school strikers. “They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken,” it said."

"One of the biggest challenges of climate politics is that the solutions seem scarier than the problem. We worry that to truly decarbonize, we’d need an authoritarian government or endless austerity. But a big and bold enough Green New Deal could finally make us truly free. The principles that animated the New Deal are often associated with Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s proposed (but never fully enacted) Economic Bill of Rights. These included rights to employment, medical care, housing, education, and social security. Those goals are tragically unrealized for many Americans, and any just version of the Green New Deal must start there. They’re familiar goals for the left, ones we’ve been fighting over for decades. But we also need to rework another New Deal-era statement of principles – FDR’s Four Freedoms.  In the twilight hours of 1941, as New Deal progress stalled in the face of white southern resistance to federal power, and the war against Hitler intensified in Europe, FDR sought to describe freedom in new terms. He was struggling to bolster support for his faltering domestic agenda and anticipated foreign one; the Four Freedoms were eventually mythologized and sentimentalized in paintings by none other than Norman Rockwell. We’re not trying to reclaim American patriotism or generate support for a coming world war. But the task of reimagining freedom is critical. In 1941, the Four Freedoms idea was a bridge between the New Deal’s unprecedented federal activism, pressed forward by a huge wave of labor and community militancy, and the wartime mobilization that followed, whose speed and scale now inspire the vision of a Green New Deal. The right has claimed the language of freedom for decades. But their vision of freedom as your right as an individual to do whatever you want – so long as you can pay for it – is a recipe for disaster in the 21st century, when it’s clearer than ever that all our fates are bound up together. Freedom has to mean something more than the capitalist’s freedom to invest or the consumer’s freedom to buy. Here, we modestly upstage FDR with five freedoms that can orient us to an uncertain future. Freedom from fear: FDR called for freedom from fear of military conflict. We’re still working on his call for disarmament – we could start with the US army, the world’s biggest consumer of oil and a purveyor of fear worldwide. We must transform our built environment to grant us freedom from fear of the physical changes that already locked-in global warming will bring: fire and hurricanes, extreme temperatures, sea level rise and storm surges – and freedom from the fear that those dangers will grow exponentially worse. It also means abolishing the social disasters a volatile planet could exacerbate. We need freedom from food scarcity and water shortages, freedom from racist, colonial, and sexual violence, and freedom from militarized borders. Freedom from fear means guaranteed jobs and homes so that we can survive every storm, every relocation, and every reorganization of industry. Freedom from toil: We can’t escape work altogether, and there’s a lot of work we need to do, immediately and in the long term. But work doesn’t need to rule our lives. The great nineteenth-century English socialist William Morris made a distinction between useful work and useless toil: we need the former but should free ourselves from the latter. We can escape the crushing toll of working long hours for low wages to make something that someone else owns. At present, there’s a lot of work that’s worse than useless; it’s toil that’s harmful to the people doing it and to the world in which we live. But even useful work should be distributed more widely so that we can all do less of it – and spend more time enjoying its fruits. Freedom to move: We live on a beautiful planet that belongs to everyone; we should all be free to move around it. Freedom to move is particularly crucial for those whose homes are being rendered unlivable by rising temperatures and seas. But we should also be free to travel to enjoy our vibrant world’s wonders. Not as quickly as we do now; we can’t all fly everywhere at the drop of a hat, and some of us need to fly less often. But it’s the reckless waste of the affluent that must end, not the ordinary person’s occasional pleasure in discovering a new corner of the world. Free public transit is necessary to get around without relying on emissions-spewing cars and airplanes. The freedom to move also means the freedom to pack up and live in another city, region, or country. To cope with inevitable climate displacements, we need solidarity without fences or walls. Freedom from domination: Liberals say the market gives us freedom to choose. But under capitalism, the market is master, determining what we can do and who we can be. Every year or two, we can mark a ballot paper. Every hour of every day the compulsion of the market stamps its will on every aspect of our lives. The left has long sought to end the arbitrary power of the few over the many. We must continue to pursue freedom not only from toil, but from the despotism of the boss, from a viciously enforced racial order, and from the intimate violence of patriarchy. Now, the outrageous power of the few threatens billions with ruin. Domination also names our helplessness in the face of global capitalism. We need to know it’s possible to change our own fate, to be able to imagine the end of capitalism more easily than the end of the world. But we must also let go of old fantasies of achieving freedom by recklessly dominating nature to serve human ends – those dreams have turned into nightmares. We need to live on this planet with other people and species. With innovation, equality, care, and wisdom, we can all have freedom within the realm of ecological necessity. Freedom to live: There is enough on our Earth for people everywhere to have what they need to live well. Reusing, recycling, and – most important – redistributing our abundance will open new vistas. The freedom to live includes freedom from want: plentiful access to the basics, such as food, drink, shelter, healthcare, dental, education, music, art, and green spaces. People are also entitled to the freedom to want: the freedom to enjoy life, to be creative, to produce and delight in communal luxuries, to soak up the public goods we create for everyone’s pleasure, to love those we love, and to find new people to love too. The freedom to live a good life spans the shared wonders of knowledge, leisure, and adventure. Enemies of climate action warn of totalitarian dullness, while the fossil industry commits crimes against humanity to maintain the privileges of a few. The point of a Green New Deal is to build the opposite: a colorful democracy for all, to live through sun and storm. This piece originally appeared in Jacobin"
"Thousands of schoolchildren and young people have walked out of classes to join a UK-wide climate strike amid growing anger at the failure of politicians to tackle the escalating ecological crisis. Organisers said more than 10,000 young people in at least 60 towns and cities from the Scottish Highlands to Cornwall joined the strike, defying threats of detention to voice their frustration at the older generation’s inaction on the environmental impact of climate change. Anna Taylor, 17, one of the most prominent voices to emerge from the new movement, said the turnout had been overwhelming. “It goes some way to proving that young people aren’t apathetic, we’re passionate, articulate and we’re ready to continue demonstrating the need for urgent and radical climate action.” Organisers estimated around 3,000 schoolchildren and young people gathered in London, with 2,000 in Oxford, 1,000 each in Exeter and Leeds and several hundred in Brighton, Bristol, Sheffield and Glasgow. In London, the protesters held banners and chanted as police and onlookers watched. They blocked the roads outside parliament chanting “Turn off your engines” at passing cars, and “We want the chance for change now” before mounted police moved them away. There were three arrests in London in connection with the protests. A 19-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl were arrested for obstructing the highway, and a 17-year-old boy for a public order offence. In Manchester, hundreds gathered outside the Central Library before marching to the Royal Northern College of Music with signs reading “Climate over capitalism” and chanting “Whose future? Our future.” Matt Sourby, 18, said his journey from Queen Elizabeth school in Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria, was worth it: “This is our future and this is making a difference. The government has to listen. I feel incredibly powerful just being here.” The protests won the backing of a former UN climate chief, who said it was “time to heed the deeply moving voice of youth”. Christiana Figueres, who led the historic 2015 Paris agreement, said the fact that children were so worried about their future they were prepared to strike should make adults sit up and take notice. “It is a sign that we are failing in our responsibility to protect them from the worsening impacts of climate change,” she said. The school strike movement started in August when Greta Thunberg, then 15, held a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament. Now, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week hold protests in 270 towns and cities worldwide. On Friday, tens of thousands marched again, some for the sixth week in succession, through towns and cities across Europe. For the first time up to 1,000 pupils demonstrated in Paris chanting “Don’t go breaking my earth” and “One, two, three degrees – a crime against humanity”. In Berlin, a large crowd gathered for the sixth week in a row. “We’re here now because we want to be able to be here in 50 years’ time,” read one banner. In August 2018 Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden when aged 15. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. Individual protests have previously been held in the UK, but the nationwide action on Friday was the first coordinated walkout. Organisers in the UK said that two weeks ago they would have been happy if hundreds of young people had taken part. But they said the huge turnout – in the face of threats of recriminations from some schools and criticism in sections of the media – showed the strength of feeling among young people about the climate crisis. Jake Woodier, of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, said: “What we’ve witnessed today is thousands upon thousands of students and young people descend on their towns and cities to demonstrate the urgent need for radical climate action.”  He said a new generation of young leaders was emerging – many of them young women – who had spread the message about the climate crisis and the strike through social media, radio, television and newspapers over the past two weeks. “The size of the Youth Strike 4 Climate is testament to the passion and awareness among young people that we need to fight for a future that simply doesn’t exist because we’ve been betrayed by the inaction of those in positions of power.” The strike was supported by the Green MP Caroline Lucas and several frontbench Labour MPs. Their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, tweeted that climate change was the greatest threat people faced and young people were “right to feel let down by the generation before them and it’s inspiring to see them making their voice heard today”. There was also support from some Tory MPs – including the energy minister Claire Perry – although others criticised the protests. Downing Street said that while it was important for young people to engage with issues such as climate change, the disruption to planned lesson time was damaging for pupils. “It is important to emphasise that disruption increases teachers’ workloads and wastes lesson time that teachers have carefully prepared for,” a spokesperson for No 10 said. “That time is crucial for young people, precisely so that they can develop into the top scientists, engineers and advocates we need to help tackle this problem.” However Thunberg hit back at the Conservative government, saying on Twitter that political leaders had wasted 30 years by not taking action against climate change. British PM says that the children on school strike are “wasting lesson time”. That may well be the case. But then again, political leaders have wasted 30 yrs of inaction. Andthat is slightly worse.#schoolstrike4climate #FridaysForFuture #ClimateStrike https://t.co/PoSCXin3VN The latest UN report warned there were 12 years remaining to avoid the worst effects of global warming, from record-breaking droughts and heatwaves to warming oceans and melting ice sheets. In the last week alone scientists have warned of a catastrophic collapse of insect population with devastating consequences for humanity, and a separate report said human-caused threats to climate, nature and the economy posed a danger of systemic economic collapse unless radical action is taken. The young people taking part in Friday’s strike called on the government to declare a climate emergency, communicate the severity of the ecological crisis and change the curriculum to make the state of the environment an educational priority. They also want recognition that since young people have the biggest stake in the future they should be involved in policymaking, and are demanding that the voting age be lowered to 16. Earlier this week, more than 200 academics, including almost 100 professors, backed the strike, saying the “tragic and desperate facts” of the unfolding climate emergency and the lack of meaningful action by politicians left young people with little option but to take matters into their own hands."

"Activists and residents fighting against a proposed coalmine in central New South Wales are hoping last week’s historic judgment in the Rocky Hill case will sway the state’s Independent Planning Commission to reject the project. The NSW land and environment court ruled last week Gloucester Resources’ Rocky Hill coalmine in the state’s Hunter Valley should not go ahead, in part because of its social impact on the town of Gloucester and because a new coalmine was not compatible with Australia’s commitments under the Paris agreement.  The planning commission has been considering plans by the South Korean company Kepco for an open-cut mine in the Bylong Valley, north-east of Mudgee. Late last year, the NSW department of environment and planning recommended the development be approved subject to strict conditions and referred it to the commission, which is due to make its decision soon. The proposed mine has been debated by farmers, environmentalists and residents, who have voiced concerns about the social impact, the greenhouse gas emissions from a new coal development, and also whether rejecting the mine could hurt employment in the region. The Rocky Hill decision was a “fantastic shot in the arm for us”, said Phill Kennedy, a farmer who lives in the Bylong Valley. “The Rocky Hill proposal was minuscule compared to Bylong, which is five times the size in terms of the emissions.” Lawyers who acted in the Rocky Hill case for community group Groundswell Gloucester said the Bylong Valley development had similarities to their case.  In his judgment, Chief Judge Brian Preston said a new open cut coalmine in the Gloucester Valley “would be in the wrong place at the wrong time”. David Morris, the chief executive of NSW Environmental Defenders Office, which acted on behalf of Groundswell Gloucester, said there were a number of proposed mines being assessed in the state that “should now logically follow the approach outlined by Chief Judge Preston”. “The one to my mind that is the closest comparison to the Gloucester project is the Bylong Valley mine,” he said. “This is another scenic valley, it’s another greenfield coal project. There’s a whole raft of aspects of this decision in Rocky Hill which would seem broadly applicable to the project proposed in the Bylong Valley.” Morris said other proposals where the case could prove relevant were Whitehaven’s Vickery extension project, Peabody’s Wambo joint venture and the Hume coal project. Gloucester Resources has 28 days to decide if it will appeal the court’s decision. The NSW Minerals Council has rejected the suggestion the case will have widespread ramifications. “We’ll take a close look at the judgment, including what appears to be a range of different reasons for the outcome,” said Stephen Galilee, the council’s chief executive. “However, we don’t believe this is in any way a ‘landmark case’, given the department of planning had already recommended against the approval of the project.” But George Woods, the NSW coordinator of the anti-mining action group Lock the Gate Alliance, said communities would be looking to the Independent Planning Commission for “leadership and direction” in the wake of the court’s decision. “Bylong is the very next decision the commission will make about a new mine,” she said. “What we’d hope is this judgment would prompt the commission to seek advice that would put the emissions from Bylong in the context of a carbon budget consistent with meeting the Paris agreement.” Brendan Sydes, the chief executive of Environmental Justice Australia, said the Rocky Hill case was “dramatically different in the sense that every argument that has been successfully put forward by mining companies in the past has been completely considered, discredited and rejected”. He said that included considering the impact of emissions from coal that was exported and burned elsewhere, as well as the argument that if coal was not dug up and burned from one mine, it would simply happen somewhere else. “We now have this anomalous situation that the most up-to-date and thoroughgoing analysis of the impact of new coalmines by an Australian court has adopted reasoning in a manner that’s inconsistent with the reasoning that has been adopted to support the approval of the Adani mine,” Sydes said. Comment was sought from the NSW Independent Planning Commission."

"This weekend, I think it’s productive to take you into the world of Coalition MPs as they pack their bags anticipating the return of federal parliament next week. The parliamentary weeks show the Morrison government at its most vulnerable because the Coalition no longer commands a majority in either chamber, but it’s not the resumption of parliament many MPs are fretting about.  It’s the looming campaign. Speaking generally, Liberal and National MPs are more buoyant than they were at the end of last year, when the mood around the government was funereal. People certainly aren’t predicting The Great Comeback – Labor remains the favourite in the contest – but people have rested, and they hope if the conversation turns to the economy, and Labor’s tax measures, that the contest will tighten. But the looming campaign creates significant anxiety. Labor and progressive third-party activists are already mobilising on the ground in marginal and less marginal seats. One government MP in a relatively safe seat in Queensland told me this week he’d never seen so much activity, so early. Government MPs report the Liberal party’s federal director, Andrew Hirst, is making strides trying to bring the Coalition’s campaign machine into modernity, but they still feel a long way behind their opponents. Coupled with the structural disadvantage created by Labor’s superior ground resources, there are also changes to voter behaviour, changes that are not particularly well examined, that increase the degree of difficulty in election seasons. The one you hear a lot about is the significant increase in pre-poll voting. Australians are casting their votes before election day in rising numbers and that trend changes the dynamic of campaigning. Elections used to build up, steadily, to crescendos in the final week, or weeks, and that pattern benefits political parties, because you can conserve finite resources at the beginning and reserve firepower for the closing week. It’s much harder to pace a campaign through to a late focal point when voters in increasing numbers are voting earlier in the contest. The behavioural shift means campaigns need to assume a different rhythm, and implicit in that challenge is having the resources to communicate with voters from day one until polling day. Having enough resources also means having enough volunteers to staff pre-poll booths for the duration. The purpose of this preamble is twofold. I want to point you to the practical concerns occupying the minds of government MPs hoping to be re-elected in May, and also tell you something about the psychology of the contest, because having some insight into that explains some of the behaviour we are seeing at the moment. If we boil it down, government MPs are looking for ways to try and level the playing field between themselves and their opponents. In practical terms, that means mobilising an army for an election campaign – an army motivated enough to not only vote for the government, but actively assist the re-election effort (that latter point being crucial). The Liberals see opportunity to rally their base, and harvest undecided voters, by banging the drum as loudly as possible about Labor’s tax measures, particularly the policy on franking credits, which has stirred up the retirees who will lose a benefit if Labor wins the election (unless of course they follow the advice of fund manager Geoff Wilson and restructure their affairs). The hunt for a very specific form of political fightback, a fightback centred on raising money, recruiting bodies to give practical help, encouraging the creation of Liberal-linked “grassroots” bodies to amplify the message, using data to better target communications to voters – all hallmarks of Labor’s efforts in recent years to professionalise its ground game – gives important context to the overreach we’ve seen from Tim Wilson, using travelling taxpayer-funded roadshows to leverage what is a privately-funded partisan campaign. When you are in a tearing hurry, when you need to recruit an army because the invaders are already in the field, you will be tempted to cut corners. When you are in a tearing hurry, and the need is great, senior people will also justify their decision to turn a blind eye to the consequences of this latest escalation, even if one of those consequences is your “clever” fightback morphing into yet another integrity crisis for the political class. Part of the problem is egregious escalations like Wilson’s are often viewed inside the political and media complex through the prism of political chess – as artefacts of the race call, rather than picked apart substantively. I suspect that gives politicians a level of comfort that they can continue to push the boundaries of parliamentary conventions with a certain degree of comfort, and often be rewarded for doing it. The impulse to dial everything up to eleven can be seen across a range of fronts: Scott Morrison’s thundering about pedophiles coming into the country if there are better procedures for medical transfers for people kept in indefinite detention; Peter Dutton swung so hard at Bill Shorten this week his left hook almost connected with his own jaw; the leaking of security advice to select media outlets – a development which appears to have troubled officials sufficiently to see them call in the cops. It’s clear that no one is going to die wondering in this election year, except perhaps, the voting public, who remain resolutely nonplussed at the whole freewheeling, self-justifying, shebang. A couple of final observations about the imperative of building fighting machines. The imperative does help to rapid set one of the more genuinely interesting dynamics of the looming federal contest. The whole boomers versus millennials motif is a generalisation that can be overworked to the point of cliche, but there will be an element of generational face-off in the coming contest, because the programs of the major parties are inviting that debate. If we think again about franking credits, and the government’s efforts to mobilise on that issue, Labor will attempt to counter with a mobilisation on a sustainable funding of public services message, and on climate change. The franking credits issue is hottest in the coastal communities where self-funded retirees cluster, but the risks of climate change is also red hot in those same coastal communities, where anxiety is currently at 2007 levels because of the wild summer. We are building, inexorably, towards a clash of clans in May."
"At least a third of the huge ice fields in Asia’s towering mountain chain are doomed to melt due to climate change, according to a landmark  report, with serious consequences for almost 2 billion people. Even if carbon emissions are dramatically and rapidly cut and succeed in limiting global warming to 1.5C, 36% of the glaciers along in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya range will have gone by 2100. If emissions are not cut, the loss soars to two-thirds, the report found. The glaciers are a critical water store for the 250 million people who live in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya (HKH) region, and 1.65 billion people rely on the great rivers that flow from the peaks into India, Pakistan, China and other nations. “This is the climate crisis you haven’t heard of,” said Philippus Wester of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (Icimod), who led the report. “In the best of possible worlds, if we get really ambitious [in tackling climate change], even then we will lose one-third of the glaciers and be in trouble. That for us was the shocking finding.” Wester said that, despite being far more populous, the HKH region had received less attention than other places, such as low-lying island states and the Arctic, that are also highly vulnerable to global warming. Prof Jemma Wadham, at the University of Bristol, said: “This is a landmark piece of work focused on a region that is a hotspot for climate change impacts.” The new report, requested by the eight nations the mountains span, is intended to change that. More than 200 scientists worked on the report over five years, with another 125 experts peer reviewing their work. Until recently the impact of climate change on the ice in the HKH region was uncertain, said Wester. “But we really do know enough now to take action, and action is urgently needed,” he added. The HKH region runs from Afghanistan to Myanmar and is the planet’s “third pole”, harbouring more ice than anywhere outside Arctic and Antarctica. Limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels requires cutting emissions to zero by 2050. This is felt to be extremely optimistic by many but still sees a third of the ice lost, according to the report. If the global rise is 2C, half of the glaciers are projected to melt away by 2100. Since the 1970s, about 15% of the ice in the HKH region has disappeared as temperatures have risen. But the HKH range is 3,500km long and the impact of warming is variable. Some glaciers in Afghanistan and Pakistan are stable and a few are even gaining ice, most probably due to increased cloud cover that shields the sun and changed winds that bring more snow. But even these will start melting with future warming, Wester said. The melting glaciers will increase river flows through to 2050 to 2060, he said, pushing up the risk of high-altitude lakes bursting their banks and engulfing communities. But from the 2060s, river flows will go into decline. The Indus and central Asian rivers will be most affected. “Those areas will be hard hit,” said Wester. Lower flows will cut the power from the hydrodams that generate much of the region’s electricity. But the most serious impact will be on farmers in the foothills and downstream. They rely on predictable water supplies to grow the crops that feed the nations in the mountains’ shadows. But the changes to spring melting already appear to be causing the pre-monsoon river flow to fall just when farmers are planting their crops. Worse, said Wester, the monsoon is also becoming more erratic and prone to extreme downpours. “One-in-100 year floods are starting to happen every 50 years,” he said. The new report highlights how vulnerable many mountain people are, with one-third living on less than $1.90 a day and far away from help if climate disaster strikes. Political tensions between neighbouring nations such as India and Pakistan could add to the difficulties. “There are rocky times ahead for the region. Because many of the disasters and sudden changes will play out across country borders, conflict among the region’s countries could easily flare up,” said Eklabya Sharma, the deputy director general of Icimod. Hamish Pritchard, a glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey and not part of the report, said it is “a substantial piece of work” that takes due note of the uncertainties resulting from the limited snowfall and ice measurements in the high mountains. He said glaciers currently provide an essential buffering role as their meltwater flows into the rivers during the summer, which is when water is in greatest demand downstream and periodic droughts have the deadliest impacts on populations. “Take the ice away and those people are exposed to serious water stress and the consequences of that are local, regional and potentially global, in terms of conflict and migration,” he said."
"Carl Shoupe, a 71-year-old who lives in Benham, Kentucky, at the foot of the tallest mountain in the state, does not feel well served by America. When he came back from Vietnam, he went to work in the coalmines. At 22, he was nearly killed by a roof collapse. He spent a year on his back in the hospital. When he was mobile again, he got a job with the United Mine Workers Union. But after 12 years his injuries flared up and he had to quit. Then Vietnam memories started coming back, and he took to alcohol and pills. “I was a wasted man for several years,” he recalled. In September 2005, everything changed. He went to church and got sober. When his mind was clear, he didn’t like what he saw. “Man,” he said, “I seen all this destruction the coal companies were doing, tearing the mountains down.” Since then, Shoupe has worked with Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a grassroots environmental and social justice group that wants to do things like insulate old camp homes and use the energy savings to pay the costs. It is also looking to create jobs to replace those that left with the mining companies as coal use declined. Such ideas could now form the backbone of a national strategy that more and more Democrats are supporting and which will also aim to help slow the pace of climate change: a Green New Deal. The concept has the backing of the 2020 presidential contenders Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren and the likely candidate Bernie Sanders. The New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts senator Ed Markey will soon roll out a brief outline. A Green New Deal will aim to spur jobs and tackle inequity. It will aim to help people of color and indigenous communities. And it will try to help places like Benham, Kentucky. But most importantly, people involved say, the document will push candidates for the White House to explain what they plan to do about climate change. “Where 2020 contenders stand on this legislation will make it clear who is using the Green New Deal as a buzzword and who is serious about transforming our economy in line with what science and justice demand,” said Varshini Prakash, founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate advocacy group. The concept is already entering the mainstream. Earlier this week, Harris declared her support, telling an Iowa town hall: “Climate change is an existential threat to us, and we have got to deal with the reality of it.” The California senator also touted statistics projecting huge growth in wind and solar power jobs. Behind the scenes, environmental groups, unions and climate justice advocates have been laying out their thoughts on what a Green New Deal should include. For people like Shoupe, it’s hard to get excited just yet. They need help now, while climate scientists stress that the world is already off the pace, having failed to begin phasing out coal and petroleum and working to limit greenhouse gas emissions from industry, agriculture and land use. Donald Trump is still president, still openly doubting climate change science. Then there is the legislative challenge a Green New Deal would present, even if all the groups involved could agree on the best way forward. So far, organizations are aligning around general aspirations, people familiar with discussions said. As concrete policy is generated, that will become more difficult. One conflict will come around whether a Green New Deal can include nuclear power, which is carbon-free but runs on mined uranium. Another will regard the use of carbon sequestration, a technology to collect and store emissions from power plants, thereby letting them keep running. Basav Sen, who works with a national consortium of groups, the Climate Justice Alliance, is against the inclusion of nuclear and carbon sequestration. “There can be disagreement about other things,” he said, “[but] those are things there’s no compromise on.” For Paul Getsos, national director of the Peoples Climate Movement, an umbrella group for community organizations and environmental justice and labor groups, the Green New Deal “has to be about reducing emissions” as well as building a more just economy. Working with unions, meanwhile, could make it hard to set specific goals for phasing out fossil fuels, because organized labor represents people working in coal, oil and gas, steel and concrete: all sources of greenhouse gases. The plan could also divide Democrats in Congress. Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland has been calling for a “green deal” including a carbon fee and dividend. “Enthusiasm on the Democratic side is overwhelming,” he said, adding that he favored “a comprehensive deal that commits us to meet goals [with] some detailed policy commitments built into it”. But he acknowledged: “I know some members of the House have concerns about overly ambitious goals built into the Green New Deal, such as trying to wean us off fossil fuels in a decade.” One such member was John Delaney of Maryland, who left the House last month in order to run for president. In January, he told the Guardian: “There’s a way of doing something really big on climate change in my opinion: it involves putting a price on carbon … That’s the best way to do it: it’s a market-based solution. But suddenly some people are saying, ‘No, no, that’s not good enough, we’ve got to go further, we’ve got to basically ban carbon in 10 years.’ Now, that’s just not going to happen. “I worry that they move the goalposts to a point where you can’t get anything done and I think that plays into Trump’s hands, actually.” Advocates insist nonetheless that they have an opportunity to overcome such obstacles. Ben Beachy, with the Sierra Club, said he has been happy “to see just how much alignment on the broad goals there has been”. Furthermore, for once, some say they might have an advantage in the messaging war. Julian Brave NoiseCat, a policy analyst for the climate group 350.org and a Guardian contributor, said: “Climate change and climate policy has been framed through tradeoffs, scarcity and sacrifice for so long. “But what’s powerful about the Green New Deal is it frames it as: ‘We can build and provide millions of jobs and do phenomenal things for everyday people through climate policy.’”"
"This piece of backroom intelligence shouldn’t come as a surprise, given the summer we are all still enduring. Record high temperatures, the hottest January on record; storms; floods in some places, droughts in others; mass fish kills in ailing rivers. Climate change is back as a vote-changing issue – top of mind for many Australian voters. Private polling conducted for the environment movement and for the major parties suggests community concern about climate change is currently sitting at levels not seen since the federal election cycle in 2007.  If you can remember the events of 2007, you’ll recall that John Howard was forced into a significant about-face on the issue. Within sight of the election that swept Kevin Rudd into power, Howard signed the Liberal party up to emissions trading, a “world’s best-practice” cap and trade scheme, and declared Australia must prepare for a “low-carbon future”. The research doing the rounds as the major parties bed down their war rooms for the May contest puts climate change in the top-two issues of concern nationally. Women, particularly, are alarmed by the ongoing policy inaction, and that’s bad for the Liberals because the party’s standing among women is already depressed courtesy of the unhinged shenanigans of the past 12 months. But there’s some nuance in the research. In marginal seats in outer suburban areas – the seats that often determine the outcome of federal elections – cost of living pressures still rank higher than climate change. But people insist that climate is registering in the top-three concerns in several outer suburban seats, where the issue is normally dormant. The political consequence of all this is pretty obvious. The strength of community concern about climate change leaves the Morrison government vulnerable. The Coalition’s policy record on climate change is appalling. There is no other word for it. Absolutely, indefensibly, appalling. The Liberals have opened the election year trying to put themselves back in contention. The government is desperately hoping that a full frontal, never mind the nuances, assault on Labor’s controversial tax measures is the pathway to a political fightback executed over the opening months of 2019. During the summer the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has led a morale-boosting offensive on Labor’s negative gearing and dividend imputation policies on social media, with enthusiastic amplification from cooperative conservative media outlets hungry to sharpen their own “campaign journalism” spears, given the apparent likelihood of a Labor victory. Frydenberg has endeared himself to colleagues for picking the tax fight. Nobody knows if all the thrashing about and train-crash gifs will resonate in the real world but two tangible things have been achieved. Labor has been forced to defend its tax policies after a long period of dormancy in the debate, and the joust has delivered a shot of adrenalin to the moribund Liberal base. (As an aside, perhaps we can note that Frydenberg, with the frenzy of activity, might also be positioning himself for whatever fate awaits the Liberals post-election. Bit cheeky but doubtless true). Coalition and Labor MPs report that the community backlash against dividend imputation is now a thing – a real and palpable thing rather than a febrile media confection – but Liberal and Labor MPs agree the anger is felt most keenly among Coalition supporters rather than people inclined to vote Labor. Smart people on both sides of politics don’t yet know whether the government can leverage the current softening in the housing market to make negative gearing a point of serious political vulnerability for Labor or not. As they say in the classics, only time will tell. While the tax fight has been good for internal morale, and may yet catch fire, smart people inside the government doubt it will be enough to turn negative sentiment, and believe it certainly won’t be enough if the government doesn’t try and fix its self-created disaster on climate change. Internal discussions are under way about what to do. Moderates are sounding out what conservatives can live with. An obvious course correction would be a cash injection for the emissions reduction fund, a vestige of the heavily criticised Direct Action scheme, and the environment minister has already flagged the ERF’s remit (which is currently paying for abatement) could be broadened to include the protection of threatened species. Liberals who favour more climate action, and pronto, also point to the potential to increase funding for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Arena (the agencies the Coalition once campaigned to abolish), as well as providing handouts to households – a new package supporting the uptake of renewable energy. But even if the Coalition manages to land some kind of repositioning without blowing the show sky-high (Hi Tony, happy new year), it’s unclear whether voters will buy it, given the gross stupidity of the past couple of terms, and given the Liberal party last year killed a prime minister in plain sight at least in part because he pursued a policy to reduce emissions in the electricity sector. Also unclear is how any climate revamp would sit with the government’s aspiration to have taxpayers underwrite new coal-fired power plants, and potentially indemnify them against future carbon risk. Even if voters are forgiving enough to look past the policy car crash and the dumb and dumber intrigues that led to the third leadership change in two terms – that’s a split personality that’s hard to explain. Climate change is not only a hot-button issue on its own terms. Some of the research suggests it has also become a proxy for political dysfunction, which is a lethal combination when voters are, as MPs report, viscerally angry at an incumbent government (although some Liberals will tell you Morrison isn’t loathed, according to their focus groups, and there’s some sentiment he should be given a chance). At the moment, most of the political class is talking about Victoria. This is unusual. Normally before a federal election, a collective obsession descends about Queensland. “Whither Queensland?”. Why Queensland? Because the state has a swag of marginals. Queensland remains front of mind, but Victoria is also turning up more often in dispatches. “Whither Victoria?” is on the agenda because of recent field evidence: the Liberals endured a rout in the state last year. Courtesy of that result, some in Labor think it’s possible Bill Shorten could take government with a southern states strategy, rather than embarking on the more typical mass genuflection to Queensland. Not everyone buys that theory. Some think the anti-Liberal swing in the state contest won’t translate federally, for a couple of reasons. The backlash in the Liberal heartland seen in last year’s state election was a cost-free protest vote. Liberals lost nothing by backing in Daniel Andrews, who had a concrete record to campaign on, and was a known quantity. If Liberals vote for Bill Shorten, there will be a hip-pocket cost – the loss of negative gearing and capital gains concessions, cash rebates from dividend imputation – in other words, Labor’s policy offering federally puts a brake on the scale of the protest vote that might be lodged in May. Liberals deeply depressed about the state of play in Victoria, and to a lesser degree in New South Wales, think Labor’s appetite to wind back tax concessions will be an automatic stabiliser on their heartland backlash to some degree – but they are conscious that a potent threat is coming from “small-l” liberal independents, which will require the diversion of scarce resources to supposedly safe seats. Independents such as Zali Steggall and Oliver Yates are thumping the government on climate change, both as a thing in itself and as a proxy for dysfunction within the Liberal party which is imposing costs on the citizenry. One live litmus test of whether Labor ultimately goes for broke with a southern states strategy – whether they think they can craft a pathway to victory without considering the parochial and materialist sensibilities of central Queenslanders – will be if Bill Shorten toughens Labor’s line on Adani. He went close to doing that last year but baulked at the last minute. Environment groups and GetUp want Labor to stop the project, and they offer the party valuable campaign resources, strengthening an already formidable on-ground machine, in the event there can be a meeting of the minds. Thus far Shorten hasn’t shifted and is remaining focused on hearts and minds in central Queensland, kicking off the election year campaigning in the state. This suggests the Labor leader and the brains trust around him aren’t convinced – at least not currently – that writing off central Queensland is a political risk worth taking. But this is a space to watch."

"The Perfect Storm is the true story of a fishing boat, the Andrea Gail, that headed out for tuna off Massachusetts and was hit by a violent natural event caused by the combination of two massive weather fronts. The perfect storm is also the metaphor most often used to describe the conditions facing Scott Morrison and his government at the coming federal election.  Dr Jill Sheppard is an investigator for the Australian National University’s Australian Electoral Study (AES), a major post-election review that has been tracking voter sentiment since 1987. She is also author of the ANU poll and focuses on why people participate in politics and the opinions they hold. “What we have in 2019 is a perfect storm,” she says. “Where we are seeing independents get prominence, they fill a gap that major parties aren’t filling. “The major parties are in state of disalignment. As much as left and right in Liberals, there is a coalition of factions not only for different policies but different leaders.” After the 2016 election, the AES found key measures, including satisfaction with democracy, trust in government and loyalty to major parties, at record lows. Like the Andrea Gail, the good ship Coalition is facing two approaching fronts: the rise of the high-profile independent and mounting concern about climate change policy as Australia tackles a drought and associated water shortages. The Australian electorate has come a long way in its views since rural and regional independents Tony Windsor, Rob Oakeshott and Andrew Wilkie carved out their agreements to support Julia Gillard’s government in the 43rd parliament. The anger Windsor and Oakeshott faced in parts of their conservative electorates at the time has subsided, as voters have seen the fruits of those agreements. At the heart of that agenda was action on climate change, connectivity via the national broadband network and infrastructure investment, all of which remain at the centre of national debate. In 2019, voters are prepared to look again at independents after a decade of climate policy failure. This has interlinked like-minded independents with outside players, including tech billionaires, the next generation of corporate giants, political disrupters such as GetUp and assorted community groups determined to drag governments by the scruff of the neck. The difference too is that Turnbull’s national energy guarantee (Neg) brought business, farmers and the community together but was opposed by a vocal minority in the Liberal party room. This highlighted the contrast between the public and parliament, and now the Coalition is in danger of being left behind as cashed-up forces are ready to help independents to enter and force change, including Turnbull’s son Alex and the Atlassian co-founder, Mike Cannon-Brookes. While conservative seats have had six years of the Coalition finding reasons not to act on climate change, independents are offering a starkly different policy position – testing which side of the Liberal party is most in line with their constituents. Field evidence, including surveys by the Lowy Institute, the Australia Institute and private companies, find that most Australians want decisive action on climate. The 2018 Lowy Institute poll, for example, finds that 59% of Australians say “global warming is a serious and pressing problem” about which “we should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs”. Lowy describes it as a “dramatic reversal” on 2013 when Tony Abbott prosecuted the carbon tax scare campaign. One environmental philanthropist, who asked not to be named, says all his donations this year will go to funding “quality candidates who are committed to climate action”. He says it will be a six-figure sum and he knows of other like-minded philanthropists who are doing the same. There are currently seven independent or minor party MPs in a federal house of representatives of 150. Cathy McGowan (Indi), Andrew Wilkie (Denison), Rebekha Sharkie (Centre Alliance), Kerryn Phelps (Wentworth), Bob Katter (Katter’s Australia party) and the Greens’ Adam Bandt have all won elections. Julia Banks (Chisholm) was a Liberal who defected after Malcolm Turnbull was toppled. In May, McGowan is retiring, hoping to hand the baton on to health researcher and midwife Helen Haines. Banks will challenge health minister and the Peter Dutton leadership co-conspirator Greg Hunt in Flinders. Former Olympian Zali Steggall is the most high-profile challenger of several independents pushing Abbott in Warringah. Former Clean Energy Finance Corporation chief executive and former Liberal member Oliver Yates will challenge treasurer Josh Frydenberg in Kooyong. Oakeshott is having his second go at Cowper, albeit with a much longer run than his previous surprise announcement at the start of the 2016 campaign. The Nationals are facing challenges from two local councillors – Jason Modica and Ray Kingston – in Mallee, where Andrew Broad is retiring after the “sugar baby” scandal. There are nascent community groups springing up in rural seats, such as the Voices for Farrer movement in Liberal frontbencher Sussan Ley’s seat on the New South Wales southern border. Former Liberal leader John Hewson believes the anti-Liberal sentiment is driving the rise of independents. “The background to this is the drift against big parties and as it drifts away, we are getting better quality independents standing,” Hewson says. “There is a range of sentiments but the centre is always going to win politics in Australia. What Abbott and his cronies don’t understand is that you will never win as a hard right or hard left candidate. “There is the likelihood of a balance of power among the independents because some will get up and that will make a difference to the complexion of government.” While the publicity surrounding them is intensifying, there remains a deep caution about the independents’ capacity to win a ground campaign against major parties. Independent analysis commissioned to test the capacity of challenges in safe seats, obtained by Guardian Australia, looked at 30 election results since 2007 where the final preference count was between the Coalition and an independent (excluding optional preferential voting systems). It found the lowest recorded primary vote for a winning Coalition candidate was 42.7% for Rowan Ramsay in the South Australian seat of Grey in 2016 against Nick Xenophon Team (now Centre Alliance) candidate Andrea Broadfoot (she is running again this year). Apart from that contest, it’s safe to say that if a sitting MP gets a primary vote above 45%, the MP wins but if an independent can push the MP below 45%, the independent wins – albeit by sometimes tiny margins. Previously successful independents have combined a well-organised campaign, good local community support and an unpopular sitting MP and/or a federal government on the nose. These elements are not uniform among the big-name races in 2019. Oliver Yates, for example, has a strong track record on climate change and has spoken to forums in the seat but has no formal community organisation. Yet when former Liberal state member John Pesutto lost his seat in the Victorian election, the former attorney general blamed the federal government’s stance on climate change. Banks owns a family home in the seat of Flinders but has been working as the member for Chisholm. While Banks and Yates have presented themselves to their electorates, in Warringah the community rallied to find a candidate. Voices of Warringah, Vote Tony Out and other groups have come together into a well cashed-up and organised machine to stand behind a quality candidate, with help from progressive campaigning tools from GetUp. But Dr Peter Brent, an adjunct fellow at Swinburne University, thinks the belief that Steggall will romp home is wishful thinking. “I guess you would have to have a heart of stone not to want Abbott tossed out of Warringah and I must admit, when Zali Steggall announced, like many I thought she does tick all boxes,” he says. “But that doesn’t mean she will necessary win. Most people in Warringah are voting on front-of-mind issues and most don’t want Labor. They will probably hold their nose and vote for Abbott.” Brent does believe, however, that Oakeshott can capitalise on the retirement of Nationals MP Luke Hartsuyker in Cowper, possibly replicating Wilkie and Bandt, who won when there was no existing sitting member contesting.  Sheppard also hoses down the conclusions we should draw. Commentators have assumed the conditions mean a landslide for Bill Shorten even as polls tighten. However, she believes the rash of independent candidates and the climate focus simply make the competition more unpredictable. “A hung parliament is not out of the equation at all,” she says. “There is a frustration with major parties and a contempt for their leaders. It seems after every election, we chart historically unpopular leaders and yet there seems to be no one on the horizon who can fix it. “Yet there are not many voters who view themselves as ideologically independent, it is more that they view themselves as not fitting into either major parties.” Sometimes called Liberal-Lite, the independents challenging in conservative seats have impressive CVs. Yates is an ex-Macquarie banker, Steggall is a barrister and elite athlete, Haines was a director of the Rural Health Academic Network and has a PhD in medical science. Kerryn Phelps is a medical doctor and former president of the Australian Medical Association. Hewson says the major parties’ preselection processes are failing because the current candidates should be attracted and chosen as the next ministers. “Instead we are seeing higher qualified substantial people standing than you see getting preselected because the skills to get preselected and rise to become a minister in a major party are not the same as outside it,” he says. The Liberal MP for Mackellar, Jason Falinski, rejects Hewson’s argument, referencing the preselection of the energy minister, Angus Taylor, in Hume, who was a former partner at global consulting firm McKinsey & Co. “I think there is a perception out there that to get preselected you need to join when 16 years and 1 day, toil on polling booths and then when you are in your 30s you are rewarded with a seat as payback without the capability to represent the community,” says Falinski. “I out and out reject that. So many times people have done that but then the local MP retires but if say, a Rhodes scholar and a partner in a major management consulting firm who has worked around the world for the good and great turns up, the party usually says we will give him a go.” But Falinski does concede the party has failed to implement a basic corporate human resources functions to actively identify, recruit and provide professional development for good candidates, and if they are no good, to find a way of replacing them. “It is a hard conversation to say to a member of 20 years that your capacity will run out in three to six years’ time and we need a succession plan,” he says. He believes the only way to fight independent challengers is for the party to continue to improve and also explain issues. Sheppard says the appeal for voters has been the rise of independents who have proven they can get things happening from the crossbench. They have pushed issues forward such as the banking royal commission and a national integrity commission, and forced major parties to consider removing children from Nauru. “They are popular, smart, articulate and if there is a sizeable contingent they can get stuff done without the factional intrigue, without having to bow to tight party discipline and the electorate have felt starved of this,” she says. Whether they are a trend or a blip, they are acting in contrast to business as usual in the major parties. For example, McGowan’s decision to retire after two terms shows a capacity to not treat the job as a lifetime sinecure. Independents are no longer just saying yes or no to major party legislation. They are drafting their own legislation, mustering their numbers and brokering peace deals on unresolved issues between the main parties. Yet Sheppard does not see the current rise of independents as a long-term trend; rather they are filling a void that the parties cannot currently fill. The big parties will have to decide which direction to take. “In Australia, due to the political system, the centrifugal pull is towards major parties and the independents will lose their usefulness when their positions are replicated by the major parties,” she says. “Apart from Katter … I don’t think he will ever be replicated by a major party.” And she warns that a Labor government that fails to produce results could also result in Labor-style independents breaking away, if a future Labor government is on the nose. Falinski remains sanguine about competition from independents, saying more choice in all seats is a good thing. “I’m a Liberal so I believe choice is a good thing; so I can’t have it both ways,” he says. “The advantage of Liberal democracies is freedom and fairness and political campaigns allow us to distill the hopes and concerns of voters. “So if [discontent] builds up and organisations like banks or political parties are failing, democracy provides a safety outlet and gives parties the chance to say we can’t ignore it anymore, we need to respond. “That might be a chance to change positions on some issues that aren’t working or change our communication or explanations that isn’t working. That is, not spinning better but looking at it in a different way.”"

"A UN body tasked with cutting global aircraft emissions is covertly meeting this week for discussions dominated by airline industry observers. The environment committee of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) meets on Monday in Montreal behind closed doors to discuss measures to reduce emissions from international aircraft. Domestic and international flights emitted 895m tonnes of CO2 last year – 2.4% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, according to Carbon Brief. In terms of emissions, if aviation were a country it would be the sixth largest in the world.  But the body in charge of reducing the carbon footprint of international aviation has little or no public scrutiny. Its agenda and discussion documents are not released to the public or the international press, and the meetings are not open to the media. Anyone who leaks documents being discussed faces “unlimited liability for confidentiality breaches”, according to ICAO rules. Key observers at Monday’s meeting of the committee on aviation and environmental protection (CAEP) are a number of industry bodies. They include the International Business Aviation Council, the International Federation of Air Line Pilots’ Associations, the Arab Civil Aviation Commission, the International Coordinating Council of Aerospace Industries Associations, the Airports Council International and the International Air Transport Association. The only non-governmental body not linked to the airline industry allowed into the meeting is the International Coalition for Sustainable Aviation, made up of a small group of international environmental NGOs. Nadja Kostka, climate project coordinator at Transparency International, said: “Agencies which set common global standards for large, international industries have to be transparent in order to prevent capture by corporate interests, or even the appearance of undue influence. “The ICAO currently meets behind closed doors, including for discussion about emissions, which affect the entire planet. We’ve seen similar situations at other UN agencies … we strongly believe that all UN bodies need to commit to transparent ways of working in order to gain the public’s trust.” The key discussions on reducing emissions come amid growing pressure from some countries – and their airlines – to open the doors to all types of biofuels, including those which cause environmental destruction, such as palm oil-based fuels. Indonesia, one of the largest palm oil producers in the world, is one of 24 member states whose representatives will be deciding in secret to recommend whether future new airline fuels have to be sustainable. Malaysia, which is not a member of CAEP, is pushing a campaign – Love my Palm Oil – to extend it to non-food use, supported by its three main airlines. Twenty-four countries, including the UK, France, Canada, Singapore, Russia and the US, have representatives at this week’s meeting. This year international aircraft will for the first time have to start monitoring their emissions as part of ICAO measures to reduce emissions with a market-based system of purchasing emissions offsets – rather than by directly reducing aircraft emissions. They can reduce the amount of carbon emissions they have to offset by using biofuels, but as yet there has been no agreement by member countries on restricting the new fuels to those which are sustainable. The scheme was agreed in 2016 by the ICAO countries. But few believe it will have the required impact on cutting emissions in a growing aviation industry in which passenger numbers are predicted to double to 8.2 billion in 2037. The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) said it could only be expected to “modestly reduce” the net climate impact of international aviation up to 2035. Andrew Murphy of the NGO Transport and Environment, said the lack of transparency gave little confidence that the ICAO would tackle emissions, adding: “Media are free, and in fact encouraged, to cover similar meetings in other UN agencies … “It’s well past time that ICAO brought its media practices into line with the rest of the UN family, a move which would help raise confidence in its decision-making.” Last year Saudi Arabia – with the backing of the US – secured a new definition at the ICAO of alternative fuels to include “clean oil” because the refinery producing the oil was run on renewable electricity – something Murphy said amounted to “greenwash oil” and was “an awful deal for the climate”. The environmental NGOs are calling for the ICAO and all its committees to open to the public and remove threats of “unlimited liability” for members who release documents. “At present, state and observer submissions to CAEP remain unavailable to those outside of CAEP,” they said. “When such submissions contain commercially sensitive information, such secrecy may be acceptable. However, this justification oftentimes deserves to be challenged, as information from manufacturers which is submitted to CAEP is, as a matter of course, available to other manufactures, and therefore no harm can be identified from making it available to a broader range of actors. “Such a level of secrecy stands in contrast to other UN agencies.” Under the Paris climate change agreement, emissions from international aviation are not specifically included in national climate targets required by countries to pursue efforts to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C. This leaves ICAO as the primary body for reducing airline emissions. A spokesman for ICAO provided the Guardian with a list of attendees to the meeting and said the meeting results would be made available, but not the discussion papers. “Only the CAEP members and recognized observers are permitted in the room for said discussions,” he said.

"Protesters from the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion disrupted the third day of London fashion week, forming human blockades on roads around event venues to highlight the spiralling throwaway culture in the UK’s clothing market and to urge the British Fashion Council (BFC) to declare a climate emergency. Groups made up of scores of demonstrators wearing black to mourn those whose lives have been devastated by environmental destruction caused traffic standstills for seven-minute intervals, unfurling banners saying “Rebel for life” and holding placards inscribed “Climate change = mass murder”.  Models and protesters mingled outside the main venue at 180 Strand in central London throughout Sunday, with lighthearted impromptu catwalks staged while leaflets were passed to motorists and bystanders warning of the catastrophic consequences of unsustainable growth and inaction over climate change. Taking a bit of time out for some #ExtinctionRebellion #London pic.twitter.com/Ve1unm91ni Attendees outside the events said that ethical considerations had become fashionable, even mainstream, though campaigners contended they had always been trendy. “Minds in fashion are changing right now,” said Jonas Aucher, a French fashion student. “Fast-fashion brands like Zara have a huge impact, and the protesters are right that the industry has to change.” However, he added: “Recycled products are too expensive.” Roxanne Murray, a stylist on her way in to an event, emphasised that most people were sympathetic to the need to be more environmentally conscious and that fast fashion needed to slow down. “We don’t have to buy new, cheaply made clothes,” she said. Shop at secondhand stores and wear vintage. Fashion isn’t just about you, it’s about all of us. If we all change together, it will have a great impact.” Some fashionistas dismissed the protesters’ concerns, while others questioned whether climate change was indeed a man-made phenomenon. “We are in a diabolical situation and it’s too late to convince climate deniers,” said Caroline Vincent, a scientist. “We do need to engage, but we really don’t have the time: we must convince the people who already recognise there is a problem to do something about it.” Protestors now blocking road adjacent to Tate Modern for seven minute intervals, with some motorists turning their engines off and others defiantly revving pic.twitter.com/rFpGUI1dhW The afternoon of civil disobedience by about 150 people passed peacefully with no arrests, as organisers stayed in constant contact with police on the ground and allowed emergency vehicles to pass when required. Following one of the constructive conversations between protesters and drivers halted by the traffic, a liaison officer said the action had been a pleasure to police, adding: “You are getting the point across.” Shortly after, one motorist who refused to turn off his engine during the stoppage shouted, “Fuck off back to Richmond. Can’t you move these soapy bastards?” However, most people waited patiently and read the leaflets, and the sound of horns swiftly subsided as chants of “What do we want? Climate justice. When do we want it? Now!” echoed down the street. Extinction Rebellion met the BFC on Tuesday to discuss the action it planned to take. The group also discussed how the industry body could use its influence to transform fashion into a force for cultural change that would stop the trend for excessive consumption and respond to the “urgent and existential threat of climate change”. This is your #lfw extravaganza served up with substance. The fab @lucysiegle opines about Swarm London Fashion Week at 180 The Strand #extinctionrebellion #techstylercrew pic.twitter.com/W7CoAoqd9Y Clare Farrell, a fashion designer and co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, said: “We need to hold thought leaders and creators of culture to account. The fashion industry’s influence permeates deep within culture and radiates globally. “While the fashion industry is not responsible for the unsustainable system it exists within, it is a key driver of global trends and a significant source of ecological devastation.” She said global clothing consumption had doubled in the past 15 years, while utilisation – how often clothes are worn – had decreased by 36%, with total greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production, at 1.2bn tonnes annually, exceeding those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined. “There are no signs that this is slowing, and events such as London fashion week contribute to and encourage this continued unsustainable growth,” Farrell added, saying that the fashion industry was the most influential on earth. The BFC said it showcased British businesses engaging in sustainable practices and that it believed shifts within London-based brands could spearhead changes within the wider industry. “We are committed to supporting businesses to do more to develop through green growth and our hope is that London fashion week becomes synonymous with responsible business in the years to come,” a spokesperson said. “We believe that more than any other capital, London has an opportunity to be a part of a cultural change around sustainable business practices that put creative product at their core.”"
"A pioneering scientist who raised early alarms about climate change and popularised the term “global warming” has died aged 87. Wallace Smith Broecker, a Columbia University professor and researcher died on Monday at a hospital in New York City, according to a spokesman for the university’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. He had reportedly been ill in recent months.  Broecker brought “global warming” into common use with a 1975 article that correctly predicted rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced warming. He was also an advocate for political action to deal with the problem. In 1984, he told a House of Representatives subcommittee that urgent action was required to halt the accumulation of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere because the climate system could “jump abruptly from one state to another” with devastating effects. His theories have subsequently become proven by events and are almost universally accepted by climate scientists. He was also a pioneer in radiocarbon and isotope dating and became the first person to recognise what he called the ocean conveyor belt, a global network of currents affecting everything from air temperature to rain patterns. “Wally was unique, brilliant and combative,” said the Princeton University professor Michael Oppenheimer. “He wasn’t fooled by the cooling of the 1970s. He saw clearly the unprecedented warming now playing out and made his views clear, even when few were willing to listen.” In the ocean conveyor belt, cold, salty water in the North Atlantic sinks, working like a plunger to drive an ocean current from near North America to Europe. Warm surface waters borne by this current help keep Europe’s climate mild. Otherwise, he said, Europe would be a deep freeze, with average winter temperatures dropping by 20F or more and London feeling more like Spitsbergen in Norway, which is 600 miles (965km) north of the Arctic Circle. Broecker said his studies suggested that the conveyor belt was the “Achilles heel of the climate system” and a fragile phenomenon that could change rapidly for reasons not fully understood. It would take only a slight rise in temperature to keep water from sinking in the North Atlantic, he said, and that would bring the conveyor to a halt. Broecker said it was possible that warming caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases could be enough to affect the ocean currents dramatically. “Broecker single-handedly popularised the notion that this could lead to a dramatic climate change ‘tipping point’ and, more generally, Broecker helped communicate to the public and policymakers the potential for abrupt climate changes and unwelcome ‘surprises’ as a result of climate change,” said the Penn State professor Michael Mann. In in his 1984 address, Broecker said the buildup of greenhouse gases warranted a “bold, new national effort aimed at understanding the operation of the realms of the atmosphere, oceans, ice and terrestrial biosphere”. Broecker said that by dumping into the atmosphere huge amounts of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, “we are conducting an experiment that could have devastating effects”. “We’re playing with an angry beast – a climate system that has been shown to be very sensitive,” he said. Broecker received the National Medal of Science in 1996 and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Among his many awards were the Vetlesen Prize in 1987 and the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement in 2002. He also served a stint as the research coordinator for Biosphere 2, an experimental living environment turned research lab, during which time he briefly worked under Steven Bannon, who went on to become a strategist for Donald Trump.  Broecker was born in Chicago in 1931 and grew up in suburban Oak Park. He joined Columbia’s faculty in 1959, spending most of his time at the university’s laboratory in Palisades, New York. He was known in science circles as the “grandfather of climate science” and the “dean of climate scientists”. In the 1970s, he worked as a consultant for Exxon and wrote several papers on the effects of carbon dioxide for the oil company. His 1975 paper “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?”, which predicted rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to pronounced heating of the planet. This built on earlier studies and helped to push the subject to a wider audience. More recently, he advocated the mass deployment of carbon capture and storage technology because he felt it was already too late to rely only on a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy, but too early to take dangerous gambles on geoengineering. “His discoveries were fundamental to interpreting Earth’s climate history,” said Oppenheimer. “No scientist was more stimulating to engage with: he was an instigator in a good way, willing to press unpopular ideas, like lofting particles to offset climate change. But it was always a two-way conversation, never dull, always educational. I’ll miss him.” Associated Press contributed to this report"
"A scientific panel investigating the causes of three mass fish deaths at the Menindee lakes has pointed the finger squarely at those managing the Murray-Darling river system, saying the lack of flows was caused by a combination of drought and over-extraction, leading to the environmental disaster. Up to one million native fish, including hundreds of thousands of small bony bream, Murray cod, up to 20 years old, and silver perch were killed in the three events. While there had been other fish kills during droughts, these were on an unprecedented scale, the report found.  “The conditions leading to this event are an interaction between a severe (but not unprecedented) drought and, more significantly, excess upstream diversion of water for irrigation,” the panel of scientists convened by the Academy of Science said. “Prior releases of water from Menindee Lakes contributed to lack of local reserves.” Unless urgent steps are taken to restore flows in the Darling, Prof Craig Moritz, who chaired the panel, warned: “The Darling will die.” “No one expects the river to run every year but they have cut the water so hard, the river is dying,” he said. The report will again focus attention on the massive expansion of irrigated cotton farming in northern New South Wales, and the state’s commitment to the Murray-Darling basin plan. The panel has called for an immediate effort over the next six months to restore flows, combined with a Menindee Lakes restoration plan focused on restoring its ecology, not saving water, as NSW hopes to do with its Menindee Lakes water saving plan. The Darling below Menindee weir has stop flowing, friends from the town sent me the top photo this morning, the bottom picture of the same part of the river was taken by me during the first mass fish kill in January (top pic Graeme McCrabb) @AmyRemeikis @GuardianAus pic.twitter.com/vmVsebU9P0 It says there must be meaningful consultation with the Indigenous people who have native title along the river, as well as with local communities, to tap into local knowledge. It is also calling on the federal government to immediately reverse last year’s decision to cut the environmental water recovery target for the northern basin by 70 gigalitres, a move the panel warns will further degrade the river. But Moritz acknowledged there were limited options to prevent more fish deaths in the short term. Without “truckloads of rain” , there was almost no environmental water in storage upstream and letting small amounts of the bad-quality water go could make it worse. The report, under the auspices of the Australian Academy of Science, was commissioned by the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, and released on Monday morning. “I promised Australians I would get them answers on how this ecological disaster took place, and that’s what this report does, Shorten said. “There is simply not enough environmental water held in the Darling River to meet critical environmental needs in times of drought,” he said. “The Murray Darling Basin Plan was well designed by Labor, but its implementation has been mismanaged by the Liberals. That’s hurting the river, hurting farmers and hurting the environment,” he said. Labor is now supporting the removal of a 1,500GL cap on water buybacks, which will clear the way for more purchases of water from farmers. But he did not say whether Labor would support a reversal of the 70GL cut to environmental water recovery in the Northern Basin – something it has supported to date. The scientists made a point of saying they had consulted with the government’s rival panel, headed by Prof Robert Vertessy, and shared data and conclusions, which suggests it too will make similar findings when it is released in a few days. The Murray Darling Basin Authority said it would study the report. “The key academy finding, that flows in the northern rivers needs to be improved, is exactly what the Basin Plan sets out to achieve. As noted in the AAS report, this is especially challenging during drought,” it said. It did not address the recommendation that the 70GL cut should be reversed. The academy scientists agreed with the NSW Department of Primary Industries finding that the immediate cause of the fish deaths was stratification of the water column in the weir near Menindee, which led to blue green algae outbreaks in the warm surface water during a run of very hot days over 40C, and deoxygenated water below. When the temperature dropped during a cool change, the algae died and the water column mixed, depleting the river of oxygen and causing the mass fish deaths. After the initial fish kill just before Christmas, the dead fish and algae on the bottom may have added to the problem. But the academy report goes much further in analysing what has happened to long-term flows in the Darling. “Increasing diversions are related to pumping of environmental water, increased floodplain harvesting, policy changes in NSW in relation to the Barwon-Darling Water Sharing Plan and access to low flows and theft,” the report says. “As a result of water resource development in the Barwon-Darling and its tributary catchments, maximum dry periods between low flow events have doubled and are sometimes 10 times longer, severely stressing ecosystems.” The panel based its conclusions on the Murray-Darling Basin Authority’s own scientific work on flows from 2018. It also cited a report to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Office which identified that low flows have reduced by 70% across most sections of the Barwon-Darling since 1990. Decisions by the NSW government to drain the lakes meant there was no local reserves of water available. The scientists said regular, low flows in the Darling were important in ensuring that native fish and invertebrate populations survived during dry periods, and upstream and downstream connectivity were maintained. The panel was particularly critical of NSW and its 2012 water sharing plan. “The NSW Barwon-Darling Water Sharing Plan, and changes to it in 2012, contributed directly to the decline of low flows, independent of rainfall, and hence to the recent fish kills,” it said. The scientists also warned that the implementation of the NSW floodplain harvesting policy would potentially legitimise growth in diversions. They said the take of groundwater was also likely to be contributing to the problem. NSW said it was studying the report but immediately rejected two recommendations: that the cap on buybacks should be lifted as well as the assertion that the Northern Basin review should be repealed. The Australian Conservation Foundation called for immediate action on the academy’s recommendation. “The Australian Academy of Science has sounded a warning that the management and implementation of water recovery across the Murray-Darling Basin is deeply flawed, finding that excess diversion of water for irrigation was a root cause of this summer’s mass fish kills. “More than a million dead fish floating in our rivers is a clear sign something must change. Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick also called for action. “The findings of the academy’s expert panel are absolutely clear, and absolutely consistent with the findings of the Murray-Darling Basin Royal Commission - too much water is being taken for irrigation and not enough is being allowed to flow down the Darling River.” The scientists were also asked to comment on whether climate change was contributing to the problems of the river system. “The Murray-Darling Basin has increased in temperature by ~1 °C since 1910 and there is high confidence that the Northern Basin will continue to warm, towards a further 1–2 °C increase over the coming one to three decades. These large changes cannot be explained without anthropogenic emissions.” But so far there was no detectable long-term change in observed annual precipitation. “While climate change linked to increasing emissions has contributed to hotter conditions, it is unlikely that the observed reductions in flows is attributable to climate change alone,” they said."
"The Youth Strike 4 Climate gives me more hope than I have felt in 30 years of campaigning. Before this week, I believed it was all over. I thought, given the indifference and hostility of those who govern us, and the passivity of most of my generation, that climate breakdown and ecological collapse were inevitable. Now, for the first time in years, I think we can turn them around.  My generation and the generations that went before have failed you. We failed to grasp the basic premise of intergenerational justice: that you cannot apply discount rates to human life. In other words, the life of someone who has not been born will be of no less value than the life of someone who already exists. We have lived as if your lives had no importance, as if any resource we encountered was ours and ours alone to use as we wished, regardless of the impact on future generations. In doing so, we created a cannibal economy: we ate your future to satisfy our greed. It is true that the people of my generation are not equally to blame. Broadly speaking, ours is a society of altruists governed by psychopaths. We have allowed a tiny number of phenomenally rich people, and the destructive politicians they fund, to trash our life-support systems. While some carry more blame than others, our failure to challenge the oligarchs who are sacking the Earth and to overthrow their illegitimate power, is a collective failure. Together, we have bequeathed you a world that – without drastic and decisive action – may soon become uninhabitable. Every day at home, we tell you that if you make a mess you should clear it up. We tell you that you should take responsibility for your own lives. But we have failed to apply these principles to ourselves. We walk away from the mess we have made, in the hope that you might clear it up. Some of us did try. We sought to inspire our own generations to do what you are doing. But on the whole we were met with frowns and shrugs. For years, many people of my age denied there was a problem. They denied that climate breakdown was happening. They denied that extinction was happening. They denied that the world’s living systems were collapsing. They denied all this because accepting it meant questioning everything they believed to be good. If the science was right, their car could not be right. If the science was right, their foreign holiday could not be right. Economic growth, rising consumption, the entire system they had been brought up to believe was right, had to be wrong. It was easier to pretend that the science was wrong and their lives were right than to accept that the science was right and their lives were wrong. A few years ago, something shifted. Instead of denying the science, I heard the same people say, “OK, it’s real. But now it’s too late to do anything about it.” Between their denial and their despair, there was not one moment at which they said, “It is real, so we must act.” Their despair was another form of denial; another way of persuading themselves that they could carry on as before. If there was no point in acting, they had no need to challenge their deepest beliefs. Because of the denial, the selfishness, the short-termism of my generation, this is now the last chance we have. The disasters I feared my grandchildren would see in their old age are happening already: insect populations collapsing, mass extinction, wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, floods. This is the world we have bequeathed to you. Yours is among the first of the unborn generations we failed to consider as our consumption rocketed. But those of us who have long been engaged in this struggle will not abandon you. You have issued a challenge to which we must rise, and we will stand in solidarity with you. Though we are old and you are young, we will be led by you. We owe you that, at least. By combining your determination and our experience, we can build a movement big enough to overthrow the life-denying system that has brought us to the brink of disaster – and beyond. Together we must demand a different way, a life-giving system that defends the natural world on which we all depend. A system that honours you, our children, and values equally the lives of those who are not born. Together, we will build a movement that must – and will – become irresistible. • George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist"
"I stood behind a worn shopping center outside of Crystal River, Florida, looking for the refuge where a hundred manatees were gathered for winter. I found them clustered in the emerald-colored spring, trying to enjoy a wedge of sunlight and avoid the hordes of people like me, boxing them in on kayaks and tour boats, leering over wooden decks. The nearby canals were lined with expensive homes and docks with jetskis. One manatee breached the water for a breath, and I could see the propeller scar on its back. 2018 was the second deadliest year on record for manatees. Like many of our coastal species, they’re vulnerable to habitat loss and warming seas, which are more hospitable to algal blooms and red tide. Science has given us the foresight we need to make decisions that will reduce the future suffering of other species and ourselves, but we don’t heed it. Why?  Studies show that humans don’t respond well to abstract projections. We overvalue short-term benefits, such as driving SUVs, burning coal and building waterfront real estate. We choose these extravagances even though they impede beneficial long-term outcomes, such as saving threatened species, or reducing the intensity of climate change. Humans tend to respond to immediate threats and financial consequences – and coastal real estate, especially in Florida, may be on the cusp of delivering that harsh wake-up call. The peninsula has outsized exposure: nearly 2 million people live in coastal cities. On the list of the 20 urban areas in America that will suffer the most from rising seas, Florida has five: St Petersburg, Tampa, Miami, Miami Beach and Panama City. In 2016, Zillow predicted that one out of eight homes in Florida would be underwater by 2100, a loss of $413bn in property. I flew into Miami in early December and the risk was visibly apparent from the airplane window. Aerial views of Miami and South Beach show high density construction on flat, sandy slivers of land. A recent National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts Miami streets will flood every year by 2070. South Beach was vibrant and populated, with mega-yachts docked in front of luxury homes, sorbet-colored art deco-era hotels rising a block from the water, cafes misting customers on the sidewalks, neon signs flashing bright in the night sky. But I wondered: given the forecasts, why are people still building new condominiums? In Florida, you will see a bewildering mix of optimism, opportunism and denial in the real estate market: luxury condominiums going up in flood-prone South Beach, and property values rising in the vulnerable Keys, post-Hurricane Irma. And though the House of Representatives passed a bill to require real estate agents to disclose flood risks, the Senate has not reviewed it, and a culture of “systemic, fraudulent nondisclosure” persists in high flood risk areas. You will see the massive benefits of privilege, and the way it allows a homeowner, particularly a second home owner, to afford the risk. You will see emerging issues like Miami’s climate gentrification, where previously low-income neighborhoods like Little Haiti are rising in value and under pressure from developers because of their higher ground, resulting in the displacement of people and place-based culture. Haitian playwright and bookstore owner Jan Mapou recently told a reporter: “Gentrification is coming forcefully: developers buying the major corners, raising the rents, forcing renters onto month-to-month leases … We’re not against development or modernization … but respect the people living there, their culture, their history.” I spoke with a developer who wanted to remain anonymous, given business interests. He told me that he’s surprised that people are still buying, building and investing in coastal Florida. He estimated that a decade ago, only one in 10 buyers asked about the property elevation, or expressed concerns about rising seas. Today, nearly six of 10 ask and many decide not to buy in these same critical areas. “I’m worried we’re one bad storm away from a rush for the exits,” he told me. I sought input from the environmental community as well. “Real estate is a huge economic driver here,” Laura Geselbracht, a senior marine scientist with the Nature Conservancy, said. “And it’s at risk from sea level rise. People don’t want to believe it. That’s a normal human condition – suspension of belief. “If you’re not a millionaire and you own a property in a vulnerable area, it may be a wise decision to think about moving before the masses think about moving,” Geselbracht said. She also owns waterfront property on a canal in Fort Lauderdale, and is deeply invested in her community, but has cautioned her child not to expect the same lifestyle in the future. She wonders why she doesn’t see more people of means in south Florida buying electric cars, getting solar panels and living more sustainably. “The quicker we take action, the better. We’ve got to be leaders so that we have a longer horizon of survival here,” she said. When she’s approached community leaders in the past, asking them to take steps toward sustainability, she often hears the same response: “Technology will solve it.” It’s a high-stakes gamble. Consider innovative mitigation in action: raising roads, shoring up sea walls, adding pumps and drainage upgrades, beginning dredging projects, offering complex insurance structures. Proximity to these short-term solutions are not always pluses in a home buyer’s column, but acute reminders of vulnerability. While Geselbracht is optimistic about developments like Orlando’s zero emissions goal, and Miami’s forward-looking Forever bond, she’s not ready to pin all her hopes on innovation. She also wonders about the fallacy of “safe” investments elsewhere. “There are air quality issues and forest fires out west, and extreme heat inland.” I spoke with young farmers who recently decided to purchase a farm away from the coast. “As we looked for farmland to buy, we certainly thought hard about what the climate would be like in 10, 20, 30 years,” one of the owners of Ten Mothers Farm told me. “We knew we didn’t want to be near the coast, and we wondered whether even being in the south-east was a bad idea. Ultimately we decided that the most important thing was to be in a community that’s supportive and that we believe will be resilient.” While baby boomers may be slow to adjust spending behavior to climate change, the Florida developer told me, millennials will not, and that shift will likely impact the market in the decade to come. I grew up in two eastern North Carolina towns, Rocky Mount and Atlantic Beach, that have been bludgeoned by hurricanes. There, friends have real estate that falls into an increasingly common, and expensive, pattern: flood, repair, rebuild. Many are locked into this expensive, emotionally draining pattern because they can’t sell their homes, which have been flooded multiple times. Browsing real estate in nearby New Bern, which was dramatically flooded by Hurricane Florence last year, reveals the terminology indicative of this practice. Homes are presented as a “blank canvas” and “waiting to be brought back to life”. There are optimistic takes, too, like “circumstances have created great potential”, and “great fishing”. According to a 2018 report from the Union of Concerned Scientists, it’s not just houses that will flood, but also “roads, bridges, power plants, airports, ports, public buildings, military bases and other critical infrastructure along the coast”. Furthermore, the report indicates that financial markets have not accounted for this future downturn. The economic impact will be “staggering” and the window for towns to maintain creditworthiness and build resilience is “narrowing”. The Union of Concerned Scientists point out that “nearly 175 communities nationwide can expect significant chronic flooding by 2045” and of those “nearly 40% – or 67 communities – currently have poverty levels above the national average”. States with areas of particular concern are North Carolina, Maryland and Louisiana, where a significant percentage of at-risk properties are owned by people of color. The climate change-induced real estate crisis is imminent in the south, and it’s going to have a brutal impact on those who can’t afford new insurance, relocation, lowered property values, or bandages such as private sea walls. It will have an outsized impact on homeowners who live in flood zones or near over-heated superfund sites and toxic factories, and those who can’t afford to pay taxes on submerged land where they can no longer make a home. I look at real estate listings and wonder, what if the places you love most are no longer a good investment? What if we’re so focused on denial, data and property that we fail to grasp the human side of the situation? The moral imperative to act is not about salvaging expensive second homes on the waterfront. It is about taking responsibility for human action, helping frontline communities solve a complicated economic and cultural challenge, and doing what we can to help species whose survival is imperiled by our lack of foresight. • This article was amended on 19 February 2019.

"The school climate strikes that have led to tens of thousands of young people taking to the streets around the world over recent months are poised to arrive in the UK next Friday. Thousands of pupils are expected to walk out of lessons at schools and colleges across the country amid growing concern about the escalating climate crisis.  The movement started in August when the 16-year-old schoolgirl Greta Thunberg held a solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament. Now, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week are taking part in 270 towns and cities worldwide. Individual protests have been held in the UK, but next week a coordinated day of action is expected to result in walkouts in more than 30 towns and cities – from Lancaster to Truro, and Ullapool to Leeds. Jake Woodier, of the UK Youth Climate Coalition, which is helping to coordinate the strikes, said Greta’s message about the need for radical, urgent change had struck a chord with hundreds of thousand of young people in the UK. “The images of what Greta did and then the huge strikes by schoolchildren in other countries have been widely shared by young people on social media and have really inspired people.” He said young people were becoming increasingly radicalised by the environmental crisis and understood the need for urgent political action. “Young people see what is happening – especially since the IPCC report last year, which spelled out that we only have 12 years left to avoid catastrophic climate change … they realise that politicians are nowhere near where they need to be on this and want to do something to change that.” There has been some pushback against the strikes by climate deniers and politicians. Last week, Belgian’s environment minister was forced to resign after falsely claiming the country’s intelligence services held evidence that the tens of thousands of children skipping school were being directed by unnamed powers. So far those planning to protest in the UK say they have had broad support. Zoe Bonnett, 14, is organising a strike in Bristol next week. “People seem to think this is an issue that can be solved another time, but there is no other time,” she said. “I know this is a drastic action, this is quite a big step that I am taking, but I do feel strongly that we have to solve it now … I have to do something. ” Bonnett, who heard about the movement after seeing a video of Greta online, said young people had a special stake in the unfolding crisis. “At the moment I am having to make my choices for GCSEs, and I realised that if there is going to be a bad future ahead those sort of choices are not really that important unless we do something urgent now.” Bonnett’s mother, Joanna, said she supported her daughter’s decision to walk out of school. “I was a bit reticent at first because I am more of a rule-keeper than a rule-breaker but as she became more enthusiastic and learned more about it and decided to set up her own strike we became very supportive.” Bonnett said she was planning to write to the headteacher of her school to outline her plan and offer to discuss the strike. The UK walkouts are being billed as a chance to build towards a global day of school strikes on 15 March. Greta has already confronted world leaders with the movement’s demand for radical climate action, first at a climate meeting in Poland in December where she accused them of acting like irresponsible children; then in Davos for the World Economic Forum when she told the gathered global elite that the climate crisis was real, adding: “I want you to panic.”"
"Here’s the bad news. We are quite in a lot of trouble. A new study by the Institute for Public Policy Research suggests that a series of crises – from global warming to soil infertility – are set to hit us at the same time. The consequences could include massive destabilisation, not just in individual countries but on a global level. From the damage inflicted on human health, to a possible economic meltdown caused by mass insurance claims if the US is ravaged by floods and forest fires, we are not remotely prepared. Consider just one scenario. According to Laurie Laybourn-Langton, the lead author of the report, climate crisis could lead to 10 times more refugees from the Middle East than the 12 million who fled during the past few years of upheaval and turmoil. The far right skilfully manipulated and inflamed backlash over this last refugee crisis: that’s partly why Donald Trump is now president of the US, why the far right are in coalition governments in Italy and Austria, and why Viktor Orbán’s Hungarian regime has been able to consolidate its authoritarian rule. What will happen when refugees come in far greater numbers? A twisted irony beckons: that extremists in the Trump administration, aptly labelled climate change “arsonists” by writer Naomi Klein, will make mass forced migration more likely because of their environment-wrecking policies, and then reap perverse political benefits by whipping up hatred against the resulting tide of human misery.  But there is hope. That’s important to state, because the danger with exclusively focusing on apocalyptic climate change scenarios is that much anxiety is caused, but nothing else: it is demobilising, demotivating, because it seems to present an insurmountable challenge. It is too late to stop many of the adverse consequences of overlapping environmental crises, but not too late to stop catastrophe. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s game-changing political ascent has transformed the conversation on climate change in the US: the Democratic establishment has been forced to embrace her Green New Deal agenda, such as committing to zero carbon emissions, repairing and upgrading national infrastructure, making all buildings energy efficient, and investing in affordable public transportation and high-speed rail. The magic of the Green New Deal is it argues that confronting the environmental crises cannot be separated from social and economic justice: its other proposals include guaranteeing every American a job with decent wages and conditions, as well as high-quality healthcare, affordable housing and economic security. This is critical. Climate change, to many, seems important in the abstract, but too technical, and seemingly in competition with what seem, superficially, to be more immediate concerns. When confronting environmental crisis becomes a bread-and-butter issue, about housing, jobs and living standards, public enthusiasm is all the more likely. Investing in renewable energy, after all, could create millions of secure, skilled jobs across the world. Environmental crisis risks exacerbating existing inequalities; a just transition would reduce them. The Labour MP Rebecca Long-Bailey has done admirable work in developing ideas for a so-called Green Transformation. But the party as a whole – and the wider left and labour movement – is failing to put sufficient emphasis on tackling the impending crises, and needs to be more radical in its answers. Ocasio-Cortez has shown that even in the age of Trump, a national debate on tackling the existential crises facing humanity can be triggered. Labour must follow her lead, and passionately make the case that saving the planet will help free it of the social and economic injustice that blights it. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"
"Labour is to set out how the UK can move swiftly to a decarbonised future to tackle the unfolding climate crisis and put “meat on the bones” of its promise to create hundreds of thousands of high-skilled, unionised green jobs. Trade unionists and industry leaders will come together with academics, engineers and public institutions to build detailed regional plans setting out the challenges and opportunities ahead.  The proposal, due to be outlined on Wednesday by Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, will involve a national call for evidence and a series of regional events to build “a detailed action plan” to maximise the benefits of moving to a zero-carbon future. “A decade of austerity and decades of neoliberalism have left many in our country asking: what is Britain for?” Long-Bailey told the Guardian. “This has been brought into focus by the government’s handling of Brexit, which is at its core deeply pessimistic, with nothing to say about the future.” She said a future Labour government would oversee an economic revolution to tackle the climate crisis, using the full power of the state to decarbonise the economy and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs in struggling towns and cities across the UK. “We believe that together, we can transform the UK through a green jobs revolution, tackling the environmental crisis in a way that brings hope and prosperity back to parts of the UK that have been held back for too long.” Last year a UN report said there were only 12 years left to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown. And this week a report said insects were facing extinction, threatening a “catastrophic collapse of nature’s ecosystems”, and another said climate change posed a “systemic risk” to the economy and society. Labour’s pitch echoes the Green New Deal that is gaining ground in the US, backed by leftwing Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. Long-Bailey said Labour was determined to move beyond rhetoric about a green revolution and work out exactly how that could be achieved, and how it could translate to new well-paid, unionised jobs across the UK. “We’re launching an unprecedented call for evidence about what this means for your town, your city, your region,” she said. “We want to bring unions, industry, universities, the public sector and others together to build this vision out into a practical reality.” Labour says a key plank of its plan will be to ensure a “just transition” to high quality green jobs for those currently working in carbon-emitting industries. To do that it will have to persuade its trade union backers, who represent people in high-carbon industries, that there is a viable economic alternative. The party hopes that once the evidence has been collected it will form the basis of a green paper to be published in autumn 2019 at party conference, with plans for how each region might move to a decarbonised future. Long-Bailey told the Guardian last year that the climate crisis was “incredibly dangerous” and said the UK’s entire society and economy needed to be refocused to meet the looming challenge. She said Tuesday’s announcement was a key step to realising that ambition. “This is not a blithe promise,” she said. “This is about the jobs at the end of your road. From the Clyde to the Humber to the Mersey. This about our future.”"

"One of the strange things that happens when you start work on a novel is that you realise what’s been preoccupying you – sometimes without you knowing it. I was about a third of the way into my new novel, The Wall, when I discovered that I was completely obsessed by intergenerational inequality. In particular, by the question of intergenerational inequality linked to climate change. Who knew? Certainly not me. Now, there’s nothing wrong with intergenerational inequality. At least, there’s nothing wrong with the version of it that existed in the developed world for much of the 20th century. That kind of inequality was based on the idea that life should be gradually better, from one generation to another – more secure, more prosperous, healthier, longer. That means that children got a better deal than their parents, but that was fine; indeed, in this version of the social contract, that was the whole point.  This model for a relationship between the generations has broken down. There are numerous reasons for this, and some are side-effects of positive social trends. When the UK state pension was introduced in 1908, it kicked in at the age of 70; but only one in four people lived past that age. In other words, most people died before they were able to collect any state pension at all. Today, life expectancy at birth is 82.9 years for women, 79.2 for men. This is, it goes without saying, a hugely positive development, but it plays havoc with the actuarial mathematics. Our state pension system resembles a benign Ponzi scheme, in which people in work are paying for liabilities accrued by the generation older than them who have now retired. When the retired generation is bigger than the working generation, there are obvious problems with making the sums work. You end up with different versions of the welfare state being experienced by different generations. A huge body of social science has been done on this subject, and you can sum it up in seven words: the baby boomers ate all the pies. This fundamental shift in demographics, and the consequences it has had for intergenerational inequality, has been severely compounded by other trends in our society and politics. Austerity has made the welfare state less generous. Perhaps even more importantly, through the deliberate use of bureaucratic cruelty in the form of practices such as sanctions, it has introduced a darkness to the welfare state. In a landscape of food banks and fit-for-work tests, the experience of state assistance has a fundamentally different tone from the one summed up in the idea of cradle-to-grave care. That’s not all. Brexit is the most intergenerationally divisive issue this country has ever faced, and that dividedness stares at you when you look at a breakdown of how people voted, with over-65s twice as likely to have voted leave as under-25s. For the first time, age is a better predictor of a person’s politics than income – which shows how intergenerationally divided our country now is. It gets worse. The central premise of capitalism, the idea that work was the means to a escape from poverty and towards a decent standard of living, has been broken by the stagnation of pay growth and the use of in-work benefits to subsidise corporate profits. And finally, the grotesque inflation in property prices has caused the collapse in levels of home-ownership among the young, and the directly linked phenomenon of housing poverty, in which a huge proportion of people’s earnings are consumed by housing costs. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, 47% of the poorest fifth pay more than a third of their income on rent. The Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that among young middle earners, home ownership has fallen from 65% to 27% in the last two decades. When it comes to housing there is no question that the young have a dramatically worse deal than their parents. It’s at this point that somebody needs to speak up for the boomers. It’s not like all of this was a plan. The shift in demographics was foreseeable, but austerity, Brexit and our housing madness were all, essentially, historical accidents. In addition, although the postwar welfare state looks pretty good in retrospect, it’s easy to forget that life didn’t seem all that great at the time. The paradise of state provision was only relative, and life was at least as fractured and anxious as it is today. When I turned 20, more than three million people were unemployed, three times as high a percentage as now; inflation had recently been in the high teens, and interest rates still were. If you were able to put down a deposit on a house, you would be sweating about that double-digit compound interest mortgage payment every month. And then, for lots of us in the late 80s, no sooner did we buy a place but the housing market imploded. In the south-east, real, post-inflation house prices fell by 46% in the early 90s. That left millions of people in negative equity, a horrible experience forgotten by everyone except the people who lived through it. The emotional and political landscape was difficult, too. We lived and dreamed the threat of nuclear war, which, with President Reagan in charge of the developed world, seemed more likely than it ever has since. Oh, and with the arrival of Aids, and before the invention of retrovirals, sex could kill you. Growing up as a boomer, life in the first world was harder for women, for ethnic minorities, for the LGBTQ community. In most respects, life for young people is better today than it was then. We didn’t know the cold war was going to end, that the cruise missiles were going to go home, that the Berlin Wall would fall, that interest rates, inflation rates and unemployment would all drop. We didn’t know that our homes (for those of us who had homes) were going to shoot up in value. We didn’t know things were going to improve. Yes, the state of the UK housing market is flagrantly unfair to young people, but an intergenerational score card is a complicated thing. A horrible plot twist is coming, however. If you look at the reports from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the projections of what a warmer world is going to look like, and how quickly it could arrive, you realise we are facing the prospect of the most radical form of intergenerational inequality the world has ever seen. That would be a world in which different generations don’t just have different versions of the social and economic contract, but instead grow up with fundamentally different maps of the world. A world four degrees warmer – the world for which we are heading, in some of the worst-case scenarios – is a world of floods, droughts, drowned cities and coastlines, crop failures, unprecedented levels of mass migration, and all of it arriving in the gap between three or even two generations. Of course, it’s possible we will get lucky, in the way that my generation got lucky, and that warming comes in at the lower estimates. The world would be hotter, but not uninhabitably, unimaginably so. But I don’t think we can just cross our fingers and hope for that. The need for intergenerational justice on the issue of the climate could not be stronger. The prospect of leaving a broken world for our descendants is the clearest call to action on climate change we will ever get. • John Lanchester is a journalist and author.

"We, the undersigned academics, stand in solidarity with the children going on school climate strike on 15 February, and with all those taking a stand for the future of the planet. Nelson Mandela once said: “Our children are our greatest treasure. They are our future. Those who abuse them tear at the fabric of our society and weaken our nation.” Human planetary abuse is, in a very real sense, child neglect.  As many of us and other fellow academics have indicated previously in this newspaper (Letters, 27 October 2018), the scientific evidence of climate change is clear. For example, the summer of 2018 has been confirmed by the Met Office as the hottest on record for England. The heatwave adversely affected crops across Europe, with wheat and potato harvests reduced by one quarter, which in turn impacted upon food prices. Australia is similarly experiencing “hottest on record” weather events. As citizens across the globe will know and testify, many comparably disturbing examples could be given. We cannot nurture our children without Nature. We are rapidly losing sea ice in the Arctic. The warming of the ocean, the melting of land ice and the ensuing rising sea levels will threaten coasts. In 2018, the European Drought Observatory noted a high deficit in soil moisture across Scotland, Ireland and much of northern Europe. This increases the risk of wildfires, such as those we saw across England in 2018. As well as posing a direct threat to life, fires produce toxic smoke, which is a significant health risk to young and old alike. Sir David Attenborough has warned: “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon.” Many other organisations, like Extinction Rebellion, are now working to bring the truth about the ecological crisis to the public’s attention. It is with these tragic and desperate events in mind that we offer our full support to the students – some of whom may well aspire to be the academics of the future – who bravely plan to strike on 15 February to demand that the UK government takes climate action. They have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken. We are inspired that our children, spurred on by the noble actions of Greta Thunberg and many other striking students all around the world, are making their voices heard.Alison Green, PhD (Psychology), National Director (UK) ScientistsWarning.orgSir Tim Smit Co-Founder, Eden Project & Exec Chair Eden Project InternationalProfessor Kevin Anderson, Joint chair of Energy and Climate Change at Manchester and Uppsala UniversitiesProfessor Tony Watts OBEMolly Scott Cato MEP, Professor of Green Economics, University of RoehamptonChris Rapley CBE, Professor of Climate Science, UCLProfessor T.

"The high-profile independent taking on Tony Abbott in Warringah at the coming federal election says Labor’s climate change policy needs to be more ambitious and include an explicit commitment to block the Adani coalmine. In an interview with Guardian Australia’s political podcast, Zali Steggall said the current policy outlined by Bill Shorten was on the right track, but she challenged the opposition to go further. “I don’t think it’s ambitious enough.”  Steggall said Labor, given the potential for a change of government later in the year, needed to include a commitment to block the controversial Queensland coal project. “Our financial institutions aren’t prepared to lend or invest in coal projects, why should the Australia people’s money be invested?” She said Labor, if it wins this year’s federal contest, needed to use whatever regulatory powers it had available to it to stop the project. “We need an orderly retirement of coal, I don’t think we should be entering new projects,” Steggall said. “The attention should be with renewables, technology, clean transport, clean energy – not projects like Adani.” Steggall, a barrister, and former Olympic ski champion, is one of a group of small l liberal independents taking on government frontbenchers in the federal election contest expected in May, and has put Abbott and the Coalition’s record on climate change front and centre of her campaign in the Sydney seat. The environment movement, and activist groups like GetUp, also want Labor to strengthen its position on the Adani project, an idea Shorten countenanced seriously last year, before stepping back. Private polling conducted for the environment movement and for the major parties suggests community concern about climate change is currently sitting at levels not seen since the federal election cycle in 2007. In political terms, Labor strategists think strengthening the current position on Adani would be beneficial to the election effort in the southern states and in south-east Queensland, but could write off the party’s chances in central Queensland. Steggall said voters were desperate for action on climate change. The issue she said, had become “a political football” and that had led to “up and down results”. “I’ll be advised by experts, I’m not an expert on climate change, I’m a concerned resident … to me, this is something that needs to be bipartisan, [the policy] needs to be supported by facts and experts and across industries so we can come up with a strategy that has longevity – a long-term plan. “The last four years has seen increased emissions because everyone goes on their agenda.” Steggall entered the contest in Warringah in late January. Well known in Manly, she is regarded as a real chance against Abbott if her insurgency can depress his primary vote in the contest. Her candidacy has already prompted Abbott into engaging more forcefully on local issues, and he is attempting to characterise her as “the carbon tax candidate”. “It’s all very well saying we’ve got to do more but there is a cost to doing more, a very heavy cost as we’ve seen,” Abbott told 2GB last week. Steggall said her fundraising goals and volunteer sign-ups were running ahead of expectations. Steggall is aiming to secure a primary vote of 50%. “Everyone would have said that being a ski champion from Manly was impossible, and that was possible, so nothing is ever impossible,” she said. “It’s a huge mountain to hope to climb, but you’ve got to set the goal high, and if the current level of dissatisfaction is high enough, that’s how people can really make their voice heard.” Steggall’s campaign is implicitly negative, centred on a time’s up push against Abbott, but she said she wanted to keep her messages positive. She wanted to win, she said, “with the positivity of the message”. She said it was obvious that in Australia negative campaigning cut through with the public, but she said “that’s something we have to address”. The ceaseless negativity of intraday politics was fuelling disengagement with institutions, including representative democracy, and the conversation “infiltrates the mood of the nation”. “You have to be offering up some hope, as corny as that sounds,” she said. She was also the recipient of help locally from Liberals concerned that if Abbott held the seat but the Coalition ultimately lost the election, he would want to take back the party leadership. “I’ve got a huge support base from moderate Liberals who feel incredibly disenfranchised. Something has to change,” Steggall said."
"The revival of the Green New Deal framework (first developed in a report published in 2008) and popularized by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Justice Democrats in the US, is a huge advance for green campaigners and, hopefully, for our threatened species. That is because it has a single radical ask: an ecological and economic transformation of the current system to end our addiction to fossil fuels and endless consumption of the earth’s finite assets.  The Green New Deal demands major structural (governmental and inter-governmental) changes (not just behavioural change) in our approach to the ecosystem. In addition, and as in the 1930s, such change to be driven by radical structural transformation of the finance sector, and the economy. It was developed on the understanding that finance, the economy and the ecosystem are all tightly bound together. Protecting and restoring the ecosystem to balance cannot be tackled effectively without transformation of the other sectors. Financing the transformation of the economy away from its dependence on fossil fuels cannot be achieved without a transformation of the finance sector. Way back in 2009, before the Copenhagen conference on climate change, I watched in dismay as a “green” demonstration assembled in London’s Trafalgar Square. A relatively small group of people (I had witnessed many much larger demonstrations descend on that famous square) were there to demand that world leaders do something to protect societies from climate breakdown. But it was not at all clear what exactly was wanted of those leaders. This was because they, and their leaders had not arrived at a consensus behind an “ask” of the rich and powerful gathered in Copenhagen. There was no slogan akin to “give women the vote”, “cancel poor country debt by 2000” or “repeal apartheid laws”. The reason why was plain to see. Like a football ground covered in advertising by competing brands, Trafalgar Square was covered in the banners and posters of many different non-governmental organisations – some green, some not. Despite all the “messaging” these organisations were preoccupied with their own survival and had failed to cooperate to unite behind a single demand of world leaders. Instead, like brands displayed in any football ground, they were involved in a competitive game of raising profiles to secure additional funding. The green movement, dubbed the “largest movement on earth”, is vast, disparate, atomised and marginalised. As the ever-vigilant Paul Hawken notes, it “cannot be seen … by anyone”. It has failed to connect with movements against the “globalist” establishment – and against austerity and insecurity. One reason is that its advocates tend to focus on individual (“change your lightbulbs”) or community (“recycle, reuse, reduce, localise”) action. They have been weak at understanding and promoting the need for radical structural change across sectors and at a global and national level – change that involves state action. And such structural change cannot just be undertaken at the level of international negotiations on the environment. It has to embrace, as the Green New Deal does – the need for structural change to the global financial and economic system. Its ambition is on a much grander scale than Roosevelt’s 1930s New Deal. (Recall that his administration also faced an ecological catastrophe: the dust bowl). The climate threats we face are on a scale beyond the imagination of New Dealers. Still we must learn from Roosevelt’s administration. To tackle climate change we need simultaneously to tackle the root cause of growing toxic emissions: a self-regulating, globalised financial system that injects exponential supplies of unregulated credit into the hands of speculators and consumers. Credit that is used in turn to inflate the prices of existing assets, and to fuel consumption of the earth’s finite assets extracted via the energy of fossil fuels. Only once we switch off, regulate and moderate the “tap” of “easy money” will it be possible to regulate and “switch off” the toxic emissions of fossil fuels. The realism of the Green New Deal demand is precisely because it harks back to an era in which the global economy was transformed (almost overnight) by the revolutionary Keynesian monetary policies of an American president. These enabled his administration to deploy fiscal policy to transform both the domestic economy, but also the dust bowl. This was done by creating millions of jobs via the Conservation Civilian Corps, whose workers planted more than  3bn trees and constructed trails and shelters in more than 800 parks nationwide during nine years of existence. The experience and success of the New Deal – deeply flawed in many respects – nevertheless assures us that transformation is possible. After all, it has been done before, and within living memory. And we know that can be done, because it was done before – by the popular will that backed Franklin D Roosevelt’s administration as it began (on the night of his inauguration in 1933) to dismantle the globalised gold standard system. That is the broad, conceptual framework offered by the Green New Deal. An “umbrella” for mobilising and unifying the efforts of millions of people tackling climate breakdown, financial sector failure and globalised economic insecurity. An umbrella that will hopefully unite and inspire vast numbers of green activists across the world – and in turn trigger state action to subordinate finance to the interests of society and the ecosystem – and thereby ensure a livable planet for future generations.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is releasing a broad outline of a vision for the Green New Deal, a plan to battle economic and racial injustice while also fighting climate change. The new congresswoman’s blueprint, co-introduced by Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey, aims to develop a carbon-neutral economy in 10 years, which would require huge strides in reducing the US’s reliance on oil, gas and coal. It does not set a date for ending the use of fossil fuels.  Specifically, the resolution says it is the duty of the federal government to craft a Green New Deal “to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions”. That includes getting all power from “clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources”. The document also endorses universal healthcare, a jobs guarantee and free higher education – a huge shift in messaging from nearly a decade ago, when Democrats were advocating for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gases by allotting industry permits for pollution. Sixty members of the House and nine senators are co-sponsoring the resolution, including several presidential candidates, according to a fact sheet from congressional aides that did not include a list of supporters. However, any legislation would be dead-on-arrival with Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House, and would be difficult for Democrats to implement even if they controlled government. In supporting documents staffer acknowledge the investment required would be “massive”. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said a select committee on climate change, which she has announced the members of, will not be tasked with writing a specific bill and called the Green New Deal a “suggestion”. “It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,” Pelosi said in an interview with Politico. “The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they’re for it right?” Discussions on what shape the plan would take also involved major environment, justice and labor organizations, as well as the youth-run Sunrise Movement. Backers hope the six-page resolution will push Democrats vying for the White House in 2020 not just to sign on to the general idea, but to lay out specific legislative goals. Some environmental groups, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, said they were encouraged by the movement on climate change but that the resolution does not do enough to confront fossil fuels. The Sierra Club, however, welcomed the document. Ocasio-Cortez, a democratic socialist from New York who has been in Congress for just over a month, centered her campaign on climate change and a Green New Deal. But the resolution itself focuses on the tenets of a progressive policy platform as much as it does on climate change. It is both a framework for a cleaner-energy future and a plan for a large-scale mobilization that would rival in scale and scope the progressive New Deal policies ushered in under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. One of its goals is “to promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, deindustrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth”. The resolution says significant portions of the American population are suffering from declining life expectancy, exposure to pollution, and lacking access to healthy food, healthcare, housing, transportation and education. It spotlights wage stagnation, lacking socio-economic mobility, income inequality, a racial wealth divide, a gender pay gap and weakened bargaining power for workers. The resolution text comes as Donald Trump frequently questions the science that shows humans burning fossil fuels are causing temperatures to rise and exacerbate extreme weather. He did not mention climate change in his annual address to Congress this week, despite increasing warnings from scientists. Democrats, who hold a majority in the House, are trying to raise awareness of climate change as an impending crisis, with two committees holding hearings this week and a third to follow next week. But Republican lawmakers remain resistant to any legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Republicans in dual climate change hearings called by House Democrats yesterday attacked the as-yet unwritten Green New Deal, charging that it would be far too expensive and would worsen poverty. Ocasio-Cortez and her supporters say the strategy is designed to do the opposite – to create jobs in a green economy. Meanwhile, Trump’s agencies continue to roll back climate regulations enacted by the Obama administration. US carbon emissions increased last year, according to analysis by the economic firm Rhodium Group. Ocasio-Cortez elevated the Green New Deal when she joined activists at a protest outside the then minority leader Nancy Pelosi’s office last year. The activists are planning to protest at Democratic debates in an effort to ensure the proposal, which was until now largely a liberal rallying cry for action on climate change, is a prominent issue for the 2020 election. Before the text was released, several presidential candidates had already embraced the notion of a Green New Deal, including senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand. The former San Antonio mayor Julián Castro committed to the plan during his campaign announcement. The Democratic congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, who is the co-chair of the House progressive caucus and a sponsor of the legislation, said the resolution defined the scale and scope of what must be done to combat global warming. “We really need an urgent and comprehensive approach,” said Jayapal. Such legislation has little chance of becoming law as long as Republicans control the Senate and Trump is president. But Jayapal said Democrats would continue to lay the groundwork for a Green New Deal while pushing more incremental legislation. “This is a moment for us to push a comprehensive view of the challenge before us,” she said, “and therefore to offer the solution that we need to address that challenge.” The world has already warmed about 1C since the industrialization in the 19th century and is barreling toward exceeding a 1.5C increase, which climate scientists say will significantly worsen the risks of extreme heat, drought, floods and poverty. Already, the process for drafting the brief documents has outlined the fights ahead, even among progressives who want climate action. A background summary prepared by staffers said the plan “sets a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, at the end of this 10-year plan because we aren’t sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example, emissions from cows or air travel before then”. But climate justice advocates who represent the communities seeing the worst of environmental damages and pollution already want to quickly phase out all fossil fuels. Many also oppose nuclear power that uses mined uranium but represents a huge portion of the US’s zero-carbon energy. Angela Adrar, the executive director of the Climate Justice Alliance, a coalition of communities dealing with environmental problems, said her group supported the vision of the Green New Deal, even though members were concerned about what they saw as loopholes to allow some fossil fuels use."
"New research finds Australia is installing renewable energy faster than any other country, a trend that will allow Australia to meet its economy-wide Paris targets five years ahead of schedule if politics doesn’t derail the trend, according to new research from the Australian National University. While emissions have been rising across the economy since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price after winning government in 2013, they have been falling in the electricity sector because of the closure of ageing coal plants and the rapid uptake of renewables.  The lead researcher, ANU professor Andrew Blakers, says Australia is currently installing renewable power four or five times per capita faster than the European Union, Japan, China and the United States. That finding is based on preliminary data available for installations globally last year. Blakers says that trend is expected to continue, unless politics intervenes. “The electricity sector is on track to deliver Australia’s entire Paris emissions reduction targets five years early, in 2025 – without the need for any creative accounting,” he says. “Australia is on track to reach 50% renewable electricity in 2024 and 100% by 2032,” he says. “The Australian renewable energy experience offers real hope for rapid global emissions reductions to preserve a living planet.” The research notes that in the year to June 2018, total Australian emissions increased by 3.4 megatonnes substantially due to increased liquefied natural gas exports, but predicts that will moderate “because of stabilisation of emissions from LNG, the government’s Direct Action program and increased uptake of electric water heaters and electric vehicles”. The research assumes emissions outside the electricity sector will increase annually by 2 megatonnes a year “which is much smaller than decreases in the electricity sector from the uptake of wind and PV”. “The overall decrease of 10-11 MT per year is fast enough to reach Australia’s entire Paris target in 2025,” it says. The ANU research suggests the net cost of achieving the Paris targets is zero, because renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels. The co-researcher Matthew Stocks says the price of electricity from large-scale solar PV and windfarms is currently about $50MWh “and steadily falling”. “This is below the cost of electricity from existing gas-fired power stations and is also below the cost of new-build gas and coal power stations,” Stocks says. “Nearly all of the new power stations are either PV or wind. We anticipate that this will continue into the future, provided that energy policy is not actively hindering development.” The Morrison government has flagged using a controversial underwriting program to have taxpayers subsidise new coal plants, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, has signalled new plants could be indemnified against the future risk of a carbon price. Industry stakeholders have criticised the short timeframe for the program, and the Australian Industry Group has warned it could leave taxpayers exposed to liabilities “with a net present value of billions of dollars” because the government could indemnify projects against the costs of new climate change policies. A mix of coal power plants, pumped hydro and gas-fired power have been presented to the government as options for new electricity generation. The coal baron Trevor St Baker is proposing a $6bn plan for two new coal power plants. But the proposal has been criticised by the Victorian energy and environment minister, Lily D’Ambrosio, who has criticised the Morrison government for seeking to promote fossil fuels. The government says it is pursuing new generation projects to ensure sufficient dispatchable power is available to the grid to ensure power can be delivered reliably around the clock. But the new ANU research says stabilising the electricity grid when it is comprised of 50-100% renewable energy is straightforward using “off-the-shelf techniques” that are already widely used in Australia. The techniques referred to are storage, demand management, and strong interstate interconnection using high voltage transmission lines to smooth out the effect of local weather. The report says government subsidies for solar and wind are no longer required, but it would be valuable for governments to facilitate new private investment in storage and new transmission lines."
"The president of the International Ski Federation has apologised after an interview in which he questioned climate change and said he preferred countries run by dictators to host competitions. In an interview published in the Swiss newspaper Tages Anzeiger earlier this week, Gian Franco Kasper said “dictators can organize [big] events ... without asking the people’s permission”. He added that “from the business side, I say: I just want to go to dictatorships, I do not want to argue with environmentalists.” The 75-year-old, who has been president of the federation since 1998, and was a member of the IOC until last year, said his comments had been as a result of a “misunderstanding” explaining they “were not meant to be taken literally but this was not clear in the final story.” He also referred to “so-called” climate change in the interview. When asked to elaborate on his beliefs, he referred to cold temperatures at last year’s Winter Olympics. “We have snow, sometimes even a lot of it. I was in Pyeongchang for the Olympiad. We had -35C. Everybody who came up to me shivering I greeted with, ‘Welcome to global warming’.” He added that immigrants were to blame for the decline of winter sports in Switzerland. “The second generation of immigrants has nothing to do with skiing,” he said. “There are no ski camps anymore.” Kasper has made controversial statements in the past. In 2005, he said he was opposed to women competing in the ski jump. “Don’t forget, it’s like jumping down from, let’s say, about two meters on the ground about a thousand times a year, which seems not to be appropriate for ladies from a medical point of view.” Kasper’s latest comments came as the skiing world championships take place in Sweden. Norwegian skier Aksel Lund Svindal called Kasper’s remarks “stupid” and “complete gibberish”."

"Today, Friday 15 February, thousands of students from schools, colleges, and universities all around the UK will be going on strike, and I’m one of them. I’m taking part in the Youth Strike 4 Climate movement because I want to make a difference. I want my generation’s voice to be heard and listened to. We stand to lose the most from catastrophic climate change, yet we’re the ones who’ve been excluded from the most serious conversations.  I don’t believe that previous generations wanted to create a world that faces such catastrophe, but when confronted with the stark reality, many have pushed it to one side because it doesn’t seem an immediate threat. We can’t run down the clock on this issue. Twelve years – the amount of time climate scientists have given us to keep global warming in check – seems like a long time to me: it’s two-thirds of my life. But it’s no time at all to instigate the sort of radical change that we need. It scares me to think that my life could be defined so rigidly from so early on. In the space of 12 years, we could have three separate governments, each with their own agendas. This issue cannot be one that is used for popularity contests, it’s one that requires immediate, unified and urgent action. Politicians are gambling with the future of all known life. I’m often asked if I think my actions will make a difference. How can students skipping school change anything except our grades? Only time will tell, but what I do know is that the nation is suddenly talking about climate change again, and that’s because of our actions. Greta Thunberg’s individual action has shown we can get noticed, and conversations are starting. Imagine how much attention the climate crisis will get when thousands of us demand our right to a healthy planet and a future to look forward to. I’m not striking because I know how to tackle climate change, I’m striking because I want the people with the power to do something to start addressing it. They need to listen to the scientists who have been warning us about climate change for years – and who understand how best to solve this mess. We’ve been called truants and snowflakes, but if we were really involved in this because we wanted a day off school, there are much easier ways to go about it. Standing in the cold, demanding that those in power take our futures seriously isn’t something we’re glad we have to do. I wish that the burden didn’t fall on any of our shoulders. We are being asked to write our epitaphs before most of us are even able to vote, but I refuse to be passive in the face of catastrophe. Several of my friends and classmates are striking with me, and many who aren’t are supportive. We are aware that we will be skipping lessons for something that may not make a big difference – and we’re all conscious of how precious our education is. It’s only due to the severity of the issue that we are jeopardising it.  My college has been less than supportive, as it believes that there are better ways to make a difference than encouraging students to participate. I sent a college-wide email to let people know what I was doing and how they could get involved. I was quickly told by a staff member that I wasn’t allowed to use the college system to spread political messages. It saddened me that demanding a say in my future, and the future of all life on Earth, was regarded as a political message. Surely me doing nothing would be a breach of my duty of care for future generations, just as our leaders doing nothing now is a failure to live up to theirs? I want the people in power to wake up, become leaders, and realise that they only have 12 years to change their legacies. The fact that the movement so far has received so much positive attention gives me hope that it will prompt change – because we need drastic and immediate action. Even if the climate strike doesn’t prompt the change we need and demand, it has given so many young people across the country a chance to raise their voice and make it heard. This movement is allowing young people to realise they’re not alone, that others care about the climate, and are worried about the future. I will continue to raise awareness of the climate crisis, and I will continue to demand change – starting with the global school strike on Friday.  • Rosie Smart-Knight is a 17-year-old student"
"The Nationals leader Michael McCormack has made his first visit to Menindee since the ecological disaster which led to the death of up to a million fish, claiming “we’re all experts in hindsight”. The deputy prime minister visited the fish-kill ground-zero site with local Nationals MP Mark Coulton, who was also making his first visit since the mass death was reported early last month. McCormack, who attempted to limit the water returned to the environment even further in the 2012 Murray-Darling Basin plan, calling it an “assault on regional Australia”, and had earlier prescribed the mass deaths to “it just hasn’t rained”, told reporters “we’re all experts in hindsight” when asked if the river could have been managed better. “The fact is it hasn’t rained in some catchments for seven long years,” he said. “Everybody will have a different opinion on what should or shouldn’t have been done – the fact is the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, with the CEO, Phillip Glyde, he’s putting into place what the Water Act of 2007 asked him. “The authority is an independent statutory body, it’s doing what is legislated and been passed in a bipartisan way between all the states and the commonwealth.” A royal commission ordered by the former South Australian Labor government into issues with the Murray-Darling River at its end found gross maladministration, negligence and unlawful actions in creating and administering the basin plan had led to the river system’s poor health. The senior counsel to the royal commission, Richard Beasley, has subsequently said politics, not science, dictated how the Murray-Darling Basin plan was implemented, which led to irrigators receiving too much water at the expense of the environment. McCormack, who has followed his predecessor’s lead in defending irrigators in the wake of the fish kill, said the blame pointed at cotton and rice farmers was “not entirely fair”. “The fact is in the Cubby Station area there’s only been 300 hectares of cotton grown and they’re growing 1% of cotton across the basin that they could in a generally good season. “They’ve had no water allocations – the fact is it is dry and governments can’t make it rain. If we could, we could. It’s a dire situation. “It will be solved through better water sharing access and we appreciate that. That is why the federal government has asked to have a chair of an independent panel which will look at the fish kill, to look at other provisions of the plan and he will report back to government, back to the agriculture and water resources minister federally, David Littleproud, by 31 March. “We will take action on his recommendations. I know there are other inquiries going on as well. He also said the government was doing “everything we can”, acknowledging it was “a crisis”. “Mark and I acknowledge that,” he said. “So we’re doing everything we can. Mark, as a good, responsible, local member, has turned up today. We have, in good faith listened to the passion and seen the determination and we’ve heard about the devastation that this fish kill incident has caused.” Asked if he would be visiting other towns in the region which are now running out of water, McCormack said he heard from people “in Walgett and other parts”, but made a point of mentioning his workload. “That’s why I’m pleased I have such a good local member, Mark, who is getting out and about in his region and reporting back,” he said. “The fact is it’s a big nation. You know, I’m dealing with fires in Tasmania, I’m also, you know, hearing about the devastation of the floods in Townsville and Julia Creek and Queensland. “So, as the deputy prime minister and minister for infrastructure, transport and regional development, it’s a very big nation. When asked about climate change, McCormack pivoted to attack Labor over energy policy differences. “We are looking at climate, of course, climate has been changing since year dot,” he said. “We’re more than meeting our emissions targets. We don’t want to deindustrialise Australia, or stop farmers from their agricultural pursuits. “What we don’t want is what the Greens and Bill Shorten would have us do, and have 45% emissions targets which are unrealistic. “We don’t want to go down a path of renewables, which is not going to solve anything, apart from de-industrialising Australia and making sure we don’t do manufacturing here and push electricity bills into the unaffordable state.”"

"David Wallace-Wells’s apocalyptic depiction of a world made uninhabitable by climate chaos caused an outcry when it was published in New York magazine in 2017. Based on the worst-case scenarios foreseen by science, his article portrayed a world of drought, plague and famine, in which acidified oceans drown coastal homelands, dormant diseases are released from ancient ice, conflicts surge, economies collapse, human cognitive abilities decline and heat stress becomes more intolerable in New York City than in present-day Bahrain. Critics called this irresponsibly alarmist. Supporters said it was a long-overdue antidote to climate complacency. Whatever your view, it was among the best-read climate articles in US history. Now he is back with a book-length follow-up.  Jonathan Watts: You have written a hell of a book. Your now-famous opening lines – “It’s worse, much worse, than you think” – are like a voice from a nightmare. Are you deliberately upsetting people about the climate? David Wallace-Wells: That is one of the intentions. My hope is first of all to tell the story as I see it. That has a couple of components. One is to show the crisis is happening much faster and is more all-encompassing than people think. And then also to think how those dramatic changes are going to cascade through the lives we live, the way we relate to one another, our politics, our culture, our psychology, all that stuff. I would like people to be scared of what is possible because I’m scared. And because I am motivated by fear, I also hope they will be motivated. The sense of speed comes across very strongly. It is as if people have got used to seeing the climate crisis as an old horror film with slow-lurching zombies but, in your version, the zombies are the much faster, scarier ones you see in modern horror films. You address the risks of heat death, hunger, drowning, wildfire, dying oceans, economic collapse and conflict, and suggest the climate problem driving them has super-accelerated beyond what many people think. That is the thing that first opened my eyes to the change. When I learned the astonishing fact that more than half of the carbon we have emitted into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels was emitted in the past 25 years, that really shocked me. This means we have burned more fossil fuels since the UN established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) than in all of the centuries before – so we have done more damage knowingly than we ever managed in ignorance. That is a horrifying fact. It also means we are engineering our own devastation practically in real time. How much will depend on how we act, how we behave, how we respond. The book is based on the piece you wrote for New York magazine last year that focused on worst-case climate scenarios. Were you prepared for the storm that caused? It had about 6m page views. Within a couple of days, it was the most-read article we had ever published. It was a true phenomenon. That was thrilling in a way because the conventional wisdom about climate writing – at least in American journalism – was that it was traffic Kryptonite, that nobody would read these stories. I felt that was in part because we had left a lot of storytelling tools on the table and weren’t embracing a certain kind of writing that might reach people dramatically. I felt the article was a proof of concept for that. In the book, you focus more on warming of around 2-4C, which is more likely than the worst-case scenarios, though still bad enough. Was this different approach an attempt to tighten up because there was quite a lot of scientific pushback on some of the claims you made in the original article? I had anticipated a pushback. I wrote in the original article about scientific reticence and the way many researchers were reluctant to talk about their own scary findings in public in the terms they might have included in their papers. But I do not feel the science of my story was irresponsible. We ended up publishing four corrections to the piece. What it motivated me to do – and not just me, but my fact checker and the editor – was to publish this fully annotated version of the piece within a couple of days, in which we footnoted every fact with a paper. I do believe that basically answered that first reflexive criticism of the piece as being scientifically irresponsible. There were also questions about rhetoric. Scientists said your article was “hyperbolic” and “exaggerated”, and your alarmism was as irresponsible as climate denial. In the book, you are unapologetic. You write: “The facts are hysterical” and the only way to address them is with the language of theology and mythology. Is this Armaggeddonising a way to reach new audiences and break down barriers? Yes, and to activate people who are only casually engaged. To me, that is the most important messaging mission. It is important to mobilise people who at the moment are concerned, but basically complacent, and turn them into people who are much more activated and essentially voting about climate as a first-order political priority rather than a third- or fourth-order priority – judging politicians on the basis of their climate policy. Disruption is important. But to what extent? You talk of last year’s UN IPCC 1.5C report. It is a science paper and it is sober. It spells out the huge – and horrifying – differences between 1.5C and 2C of warming, and the actions we need to take right now if we are to avoid the extra half a degree, which will require a 45% reduction in emissions by 2030. You say the message of the report is: “It’s OK now to freak out.” But I guess most scientists would say: “Don’t freak out! Act! Focus! Do not succumb to paralysing fear.” Is “freak out” what you really mean? The short answer is yes. We should not sit back and feel complacent that the world beyond us will figure this out without political pressure. We cannot continue on the path we are on and believe our future will be secure and stable. We need to dramatically change our climate policy globally. That was the very clear message of the UN report. You are right that, in a certain way, it was written soberly, but it is also the case that it was saying we need mobilisation on the scale that we saw in the second world war in Europe and the US – and that is not a keep-calm message. It is saying we have to light the fuse and get going. On the question of what kind of motivation is most effective, I don’t believe fear and alarm are the only options; there is a place for hope and optimism. There are many shades in between. But fear is what animated me. We do not tell people only about the positive benefits of quitting smoking. We tell them about what will happen to them if they smoke. And to go back to the second world war analogy, we did not mobilise in that way because we were optimistic about the future. We mobilised in that way out of fear, because we thought nazism was an existential threat. And climate change is obviously an existential threat and it is naive to imagine we could respond to it without some people being scared. I think it is silly to throw that rhetorical tool away. My basic perspective is that any story that sticks is a good one. If you can get people engaged, it is good, however you do it. But I also come to this subject not as an advocate, not as an environmentalist. I have been drawn into that role to some extent as a result of this work. I come into it as a journalist and as a storyteller and, at some level, the imperative for me is to tell the story true, to tell it as I see it. As you say, and as I wrote in the book, it is simply the case that the facts are hysterical. To shy away from that, I think, is irresponsible – in part because it would encourage complacency but also from the basic truth-telling level. We know these things are true to the extent that scientists can know them. I don’t think the public should be shielded from them. What struck me in the book was that you shake the reader up and say, “Look, wake up, get going!”, and yet there isn’t much there in terms of where to go next. You delved into solutions, but you didn’t give them much chance of achieving anything. Do you believe there isn’t much out there that could help us? I think the book does a fair amount of hope-giving. The most important thing anybody can do is vote. If people are mobilised, we can relatively quickly usher in – perhaps not globally, but in many of the more important nations – a much stronger commitment to a more aggressive climate policy. My hope is that the US and China, with support from some other countries, start making dramatic investments in [negative-emissions] climate technology in the near future. I’m sceptical of conventional decarbonisation. We will need these additional technologies. We need to invest in them quickly. Putting hope in technology is the excuse George HW Bush gave for not doing anything decisive in the late 1980s when he was president and it is the message of the Trump administration. You don’t sound as if you are aligned with them. What about a carbon tax? We have to do everything we can. I would absolutely support a carbon tax and what we are talking about now in the US: a green new deal of massive investment in renewable energy. But when you look around the world, small taxes on carbon haven’t had a meaningful impact. I think we have to learn from that and realise we need much more aggressive taxes or other solutions. In the past year, we have seen more radical action such as student strikers led by Greta Thunberg and protests by Extinction Rebellion. Do you think groups like this are useful? Absolutely. I’m an enormous admirer of Thunberg and I am in awe of how much energy and attention Extinction Rebellion has generated in such a short time. I think their imperative to tell the truth is very important and powerful. Would you join? They are organising another major event soon in New York that I will be going to. Temperamentally, and by background, I am not an activist and I still think of myself primarily as a journalist and storyteller. But no matter how disinclined you are, how temperamentally reluctant you are to be a joiner, it is hard to think about the state of the climate and not be called to action. What about individual choices? Early in the book, you state very clearly you are not environmentalist, you eat meat, and you think it is better to have economic growth than protect nature. But then you write: “Like many Americans, I am fatally complacent and wilfully deluded.” That was your starting point. How has writing this book changed you? Everybody should live according to their values. There are people who want to radically change their lives to reduce their carbon footprint, and there are people who want to make symbolic gestures. Air travel is the one thing that I really do feel guilty about. I make choices about travel with that in mind in a way that I didn’t even a year ago. And meat? Personally, I don’t feel that it is my thing. I admire people who give up meat for this reason. I think globally we need to be eating less meat, especially those of us in the wealthy parts of world who eat too much of it; for health reasons, too. But if I go from eating three hamburgers a year to zero, the impact on my carbon footprint is quite trivial. I have to say right now it feels so overwhelmingly the case that political action is the most important thing anyone could do, including me, that it overwhelms any of the other things. In the book, you ask whether it is moral to have children in this climate. In the past year, you have done just that. What hope do have that your child won’t live in the uninhabitable world of your title? I come at the question of hope from the perspective that truly total devastation is possible and something close to that is where we are heading now. So every degree cooler, every tick of temperature that we prevent, is an improvement and therefore a reason for hope. So, if we stabilise the planet at 3C that is better than 3.5C, 2.5C is better than 3C, and so on.  For reasons independent of climate, I wanted to have children. Most people do. I don’t think this is an impulse we need to disavow before we have finished the final act of this story. I think it is a reason to fight now so that we can continue to have those children and continue to live in the ways we want to live. It is possible regardless of how bad the news from science is.

"One of the classic science-fiction treatments of the end of civilisation was The Death of Grass, by John Christopher, in which a mysterious sickness struck down all the grasses on which most of the world’s agriculture is based, from rice to wheat. In the end, politics among the survivors of plague, war and famine was reduced to a bitter fratricidal struggle over a defensible potato patch. Like most of the so-called “cosy catastrophe” novels, this could be criticised for optimism. Grim though a future of famine and the war of all against all might seem, the consequences were largely confined to humans. The threatened extinction of insect populations around the world raises the prospect of a much more general catastrophe, which would implicate plants, birds, fish, small mammals, and everything else that depends on insects. That’s just the start. Other species, and we ourselves, depend on the animals and plants that need insects. When they go, we go. This is not just a greater catastrophe. It’s a much more plausible one. The most recent study concluded that insect biomass is decreasing around the world at a rate of 2.5% a year. At that rate, half the insects in the world will be gone in 50 years’ time, and all of them in a century – although no one will be keeping track of centuries then.  The chief driver of this catastrophe is unchecked human greed. For all our individual and even collective cleverness, we behave as a species with as little foresight as a colony of nematode worms that will consume everything it can reach until all is gone and it dies off naturally. The challenge of behaving more intelligently than creatures that have no brain at all will not be easy. But unlike the nematodes, we know what to do. The UN convention on biodiversity was signed in 1992, alongside the convention on climate change. Giving it the strength to curb our appetites is now urgent. Biodiversity is not an optional extra. It is the web that holds all life, including human life. The two main expressions of greed that hasten this apocalypse are global warming and industrial agriculture. It appears that most of the damage is being done in the developed world by farming practices. The use of giant fields, devoid of shelter for insects of any sort at all, whether they are harmful to human interests or not, and where the plants are drenched in long-lasting pesticides, has been fatal for uncounted billions of insects. The effects of this kind of farming reach beyond the fields immediately affected, too. There has been a huge loss of aquatic insect species from the rivers into which the products of industrial agriculture are flushed by rain. Even in German nature reserves, which are by definition protected from the use of pesticides, there have been steep falls in insect populations because so many of the most widely used ones are persistent and prevent breeding. In the tropics, the steady rise of global temperatures is already devastating whole ecosystems, starting at the bottom with the insects. Last year we learned of the disappearance of almost all the ground-dwelling insects from a rainforest in Puerto Rico, and three-quarters of the species of the canopy.  Some governments have done some necessary things. The EU has banned neonicotinoid pesticides. But the necessary change also relies on individual action. As individuals we must consume less in every way, which helps with climate change. We must also change our food habits. To eat less meat and more organic is not just piety. A little self-restraint in this generation will make all the difference to our grandchildren."
"More than 200 academics have voiced their support for this week’s school climate strikes, in which thousands of young people are expected to take to the streets in towns and cities across the UK. The academics, including almost 100 professors, say the “tragic and desperate facts” of the unfolding climate breakdown – and the lack of meaningful action by politicians – leave young people with little option but to take matters into their own hands.  In a letter to the Guardian, they write: “[Those taking part in the strike] have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them, if proportionate and urgent action is not taken.” The number of those taking part in Friday’s strike is growing rapidly, amid mounting evidence of the scale and impact of the climate emergency. There are more than 50 confirmed events from Fort William to Hastings, with more added each day. The UK day of action is part of a movement that started in August when Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old schoolgirl, held a solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament. Globally, up to 70,000 schoolchildren each week are taking part in 270 towns and cities. Individual demonstrations have already been held in the UK, but Friday’s coordinated day of action is expected to see the biggest protests by students and young people in the UK since the student strikes of 2010 over tuition fees. There has been some criticism of the strikes by climate change deniers and politicians who claim the strike amounts to little more than truanting. Earlier this month a Belgian environment minister was forced to resign after falsely claiming the country’s intelligence services held evidence that the tens of thousands of children skipping school were being directed by unnamed powers. But the strike has been backed by one of the UK’s leading teaching unions and the academics say the young people who are prepared to organise and take part in the strike are setting an example that others should follow. “We are inspired that our children, spurred on by the noble actions of Greta Thunberg and many other striking students all around the world, are making their voices heard.” The letter highlights the growing signs of climate breakdown, from the latest UN report that warns there are 12 years to avoid the worst impacts of global warming, to record-breaking droughts and heatwaves, warming oceans and melting ice sheets. The academics added: “It is with these tragic and desperate events in mind that we offer our full support to the students, some of whom may well aspire to be the academics of the future, who bravely plan to strike on 15 February to demand that the UK government takes climate action.”"
"The Australian National University has been making headlines for its analysis that, with the current rate of renewable energy growth, Australia will achieve its Paris agreement targets five years early – by 2025. Unfortunately, after a careful review, we find their analysis doesn’t stack up. The ANU briefing note has surprised, if not shocked, many in the expert and analytical community with detailed knowledge of Australia’s climate and energy policy.  Numerous international and national efforts to examine Australia’s climate and energy policy have all concluded that the government will not reach, on present policy settings, the 26-28% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030 it has put forward under the Paris agreement. To achieve a 26% reduction below 2005 levels in national emissions – the lower end of Australia’s Paris agreement target – would require about a 75% penetration of renewables in the power sector by 2024, whereas the ANU scenario projects 50%, which is not enough to reach the Paris target. The ANU briefing, possibly inadvertently, creates the impression that all that would be required is a continuation of the recent rate of renewable energy deployment. That is simply not the case, not without major policy interventions, which are unlikely – at least under the current government. The government’s claim that the ANU briefing note shows it will achieve the Paris agreement targets “at a canter” is manifestly false. The rapid and continued rollout of renewable energy into the power sector assumed in the ANU briefing paper is something that the Australian government actually opposes. The government’s policies are aimed at slowing the renewable energy rollout, and in particular maintaining coal in the power sector at any scale, which essentially contradicts the premises of the ANU paper. The present large and increasing rollout in the utility sector is driven by the renewable energy target. Given that this expires in 2020, that specific economic incentive will disappear. While the penetration of 50% renewables by 2025 may be plausible in the absence of further policy developments, it is not considered plausible that close to 90% penetration could be achieved by 2030 without substantial policy action. Such reductions would also require phasing out coal almost completely from the power sector by 2030, which is clearly not supported by a federal government that is currently trying to promote more coal power, not less. While the low cost of new renewable supply is also a clear driver, market barriers are already in evidence, along with grid connection issues that require active intervention. As the ANU briefing note argues – and as is shown in peer reviewed studies (including by the authors of the briefing note) – achieving renewable energy penetration rates in the power sector at this scale by 2030 is technically and economically feasible. However, there is a consensus in the expert community that these levels of penetration will not be achieved without further policy and grid development. An effective exit of coal from the power sector in Australia by 2030 would be one of the necessary steps in achieving this. There is a very important role for renewable energy in the non-power generation sectors, such as industry, mining and agriculture. While the recent growth rate of renewables in Australia’s power sector has been high by world standards, it is also the case that the penetration of renewable energy into Australia’s total primary energy supply has not progressed rapidly and is relatively stagnant. This would need to change for Australia to meet the Paris agreement goals, and as a further major opportunity for the renewable industry. The government’s own projections, updated most recently in December 2018 with present policies, show that by 2030, emissions will be at only 7% below 2005 levels. The other explanation for the ANU’s anomalous finding is what appears to be a substantial underestimation of the ~70% of national emissions outside of the power sector – the emissions from direct combustion, transport, fugitives, agriculture, industrial processes, waste, and land use and forestry (LULUCF). This is important, as the power sector only accounts for about 34% of national emissions (and declining), and overall emissions from these other sectors are growing. The ANU assumes an average increase from these sectors of 2 MtCO2e per year. However, government projections indicate this increase is likely to average around 5.4 MtCO2e a year, on average, to 2024 or 2025, and then about 4.0 MtCO2e per year to 2030 (all from post 2018). Given the underlying lack of policy, the historical growth rates and the trends in efficiency improvements of emissions in these sectors, the government projections look reasonable. The reduction rates the ANU paper assumes are far below any reasonable estimate. Finally, it is also worth noting that the Paris agreement targets put forward by the Australian government are insufficient to meet the agreement’s 1.5°C long-term temperature goal. The Paris agreement would require reductions of 45- 60% by 2030 for the whole economy.  • Bill Hare, a physicist and climate scientist, is the managing director of Climate Analytics"
"Headteachers across the country will this week be faced with a tricky dilemma: should they allow their pupils to go on strike? Thousands of schoolchildren are expected to absent themselves from school on Friday to take part in a series of coordinated protests drawing attention to climate change.  At a time when politicians fret that young people are failing to engage with the political process, a headteacher’s decision to take a hard line against the strikers could be counter-productive. But equally granting permission for a day off could set a dangerous precedent and lead to safeguarding issues, it is feared. Parents could be fined for taking a child out of school. One would-be striker, Anna Taylor, 17, from north London, said her school had given her “mixed messages”. “I chucked up a notice – ‘school strike in a few weeks’ – on the noticeboard in the common room and they wiped it off, said ‘you can’t actively publicise it in schools’ and ‘we’ll give you an unauthorised absence and detention if you strike’, but then they said ‘you can spread it by word of mouth and we do support your cause’.” A Department for Education spokeswoman said the decision was a matter for individual schools. “However, we are clear that pupils can only take term-time leave in exceptional circumstances, and where this leave has been authorised by the headteacher.” Supporters of the UK Student Climate Network, which so far has pupils in about 30 towns and cities signed up to the day of action, argue that the “exceptional circumstances” excuse is applicable when it comes to Friday’s day of action. A template letter drawn up by Youth Strike 4 Climate, one of the groups supporting the network, for parents of striking children to give headteachers, states: “I’m aware of UK law that permits parents to only give permission for their child to miss school on medical grounds or in a few other cases, one of which is under ‘exceptional circumstances’. My view is that having only 12 years left to cut CO2 emissions by 50%, as per the latest UN IPCC report, is pretty dire and exceptional circumstances to find ourselves in. And it in this light that I’m giving my child permission.” It continues: “I support her to attend the youth strike as part of active civic engagement, which is a core part of the curriculum. People under 18 years can’t vote, but with more of their life in the future, rather than the past, it’s they who are most affected by climate breakdown.” The letter is part of a cache of documents being shared with potential protesters ahead of Friday’s strike as the pupil-led grassroots movement gains momentum. Similar protests have been held in individual UK cities and other countries, including Australia, Belgium and the Netherlands, where tens of thousands of children refused to attend school so that they could take part in rallies to raise awareness about threats to the environment from global warming. But Friday will be the first nationwide day of action. Organisers were inspired by Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish activist who last August refused to attend school so that she could protest outside the Swedish parliament building, an action that shot her to global prominence. However, not everyone has been enthusiastic about the burgeoning movement. “The best thing you learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue,” Australia’s resources minister, Matt Canavan, told a radio station last November. Belgium’s environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, was recently forced to resign her position after suggesting that the strikes were being coordinated by unknown groups and were “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”. In the UK, Greenpeace is providing help with the construction of banners, while the UK Youth Climate Coalition, a 10-year-old campaign group, is helping coordinate media coverage and offering advice behind the scenes. But both organisations were keen to stress the movement was organic and led by young people. Formed in the UK only three months ago, it has grown rapidly as its message has been shared on social media. Its website was created by two 15-year-old supporters in under a week. “The wave of student strikes demanding action on climate change has been an inspiration for us all,” said Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven. “Theresa May promised our children that they’ll inherit a healthier environment than the one we found. Those children are now taking to the streets to remind her that unless we get serious about tackling the climate emergency, her promise will be broken. At the moment she is clearly failing.” How many children will take to the streets on Friday is open to debate. More than 10,000 students skipped school to protest in Belgium. A similar number went on strike in the Netherlands. Supporters suggested they expected a turnout in the low thousands for this Friday’s protest in the UK but believed a second day of strike action – on 15 March and in coordination with similar protests in other countries – would be considerably larger as the movement took hold. “I have faith it will continue to grow throughout the year,” Taylor said. “Hopefully the government will eventually listen to us because we have the greatest stake in our future and we’re doing this because we feel let down by them and we want to make a difference before it’s too late.”"
"A Belgian environment minister has been forced to resign after falsely claiming the country’s intelligence services held evidence that children skipping school to demonstrate over climate change were being directed by unnamed powers. Joke Schauvliege, a minister in Flanders, where the school-strikes movement first emerged, provoked a wave of criticism of the wider political class after suggesting the protests were a “set-up” and “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”.  “I know who is behind this movement, both of the Sunday demonstrations and the truants,” Schauvliege had told an audience of farmers. “I have also been told that from state security. I can guarantee that I do not see ghosts alone and that climate demonstrations are more than spontaneous actions of solidarity with our climate.” The comments prompted a rare denial by the Belgian state security services. “We have not reported anything about this to Schauvliege,” they said. “Neither verbally nor in writing.” The minister initially sought to hold on to her position insisting that she had not lied, but merely gone “too far”. “In recent weeks, I have slept little and I was overwhelmed by frustration, I am a human being and I could be wrong,” she told the Flemish channel Radio 1. But during an emotional press conference on Tuesday afternoon, Schauvliege announced that she could not continue in her post given the growing controversy. “It is difficult to continue to function as climate minister in these circumstances,” she said, between tears. Tens of thousands of Belgian children, inspired by the lone protest launched last year by Greta Thunberg, then 15, outside the Swedish parliament, have played truant from school in recent weeks to march on the streets of Brussels, Liège, Namur and Leuven. School strikes have been also been held in Germany, Switzerland and Australia and a global School Strikes 4 Climate Action march is set for 15 March. Belgium has four environment ministers – one for each region and at the national level – but it has no national policy to reach the 2030 goal set by the UN of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2C, and strive for 1.5C. Anuna De Wever, the 18-year-old Flemish student who first sparked the demonstrations in Belgium, had described the claims by Schauvliege, a member of the Flemish Christian Democrats, as “manifestly not true” and an “insult to the youth”. “It is very strange that a minister can lie about such a thing,” she said. “That’s just not the case. Can we stop doubting the movement?” The largest march so far in Belgium, two weeks ago in Brussels, saw 35,000 children demonstrate. A spokesman for Youth for Climate, the organisation set up by De Wever to organise the protests by schoolchildren, said the comments were in keeping with the Belgian authorities’ failure to commit to international climate change goals. “The minister’s allegation is an insult to the authentic engagement of so many young people,” they said in a statement before the announcement of Schauvliege’s resignation. The Flemish minister-president, Geert Bourgeois, had described the environment minister’s comments as “unfortunate”. The response of Flemish politicians to the climate change demonstrations has come under heavy criticism. The chairman of the Flemish nationalist party the New Flemish Alliance, which was until recently in government, last month urged the young protesters “not to believe in the apocalypse” but to go back to their books and have “confidence in the future and in the power of innovation”."
"When confronted by child protesters, politicians and other adults often reach for the age-based putdown, rather than engage with the substance of whatever it is they are protesting about. Often, the suggestion is that someone older has put them up to it. Flemish environment minister Joke Schauvliege took the patronising tactic much too far when she said that recent school strikes across Belgium were a “set-up”, and that security services knew who was really “behind this movement”. On Tuesday, after Belgian security services issued a rare denial, Ms Schauvliege resigned. On Thursday, the youth-led demonstrations spread to the Netherlands, as thousands of people marched in The Hague. Similar protests are scheduled to take place across the world in the coming weeks. They show that, in fact, young people are able to influence their elders. When a journalist asked Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg who was pulling the strings behind her school strike last summer, she replied: “Some people claim that my parents have brainwashed me, but it was the opposite: I brainwashed my parents. I convinced them not to fly and to stop eating meat.”  Ms Thunberg has said that her decision to picket the Swedish parliament in Stockholm last year was inspired by the March for our Lives gun control protests that began after the Parkland school shooting. But there are older precedents for the recent upsurge in youth activism, with children playing key roles in historic civil rights and labour struggles. School desegregation in the southern US states and the 1888 London matchgirls’ strike are two famous examples. Young people have a distinctive and valuable perspective. They deserve to be heard. Teenagers can already join British political parties, most of which grant full membership rights to mid-teens. In Scotland, 16-year-olds can vote in some elections. That should be extended to all elections across the UK. Few endorse politics professor David Runciman’s recent suggestion that the voting age should be lowered much further – to six. But many would acknowledge the sense in Scottish children’s commissioner Bruce Adamson’s criticism of the “absolutely ridiculous” double standard whereby children are held criminally responsible for their actions years before they are allowed to take part in elections. There are sensible questions to be asked about the influence exerted by parents and other adults on children professing strong opinions. But we should respect and welcome efforts by children and teenagers to make their voices heard and influence decision-making. After all, they will be living with the consequences for longer than the rest of us. Nothing throws all of this into sharper relief than the accelerating climate crisis, with figures from the UK Met Office suggesting 1.5C of warming could be reached in as little as five years. If children want to take to the streets and demand tougher action to avert disaster, who can blame them?"

"The US stands virtually alone in the world in having a leader who openly dismisses the reality of climate change. But amid growing concern among Americans about the overheating planet, one potential 2020 presidential candidate is aiming to hoist climate to the top of the agenda. Jay Inslee, the gravel-voiced governor of Washington, is poised to enter the throng of Democrats vying to dislodge Donald Trump as president in the 2020 election. He’s made some exploratory moves, visiting Nevada and New Hampshire, and said a definitive decision on running will be taken in “weeks”.  “He’s embarrassing. Even Republicans are embarrassed about him,” Inlsee said of Trump in an interview with the Guardian. “To fail to mention the greatest existential threat in the world is pathetic. He’s a blip in history we need to get over, and quickly.” Climate change will be the cudgel that Inslee will use in the ballot box fight, an issue he considers perniciously overlooked by America’s leading political figures even as the US is tormented by more powerful hurricanes, scorching wildfires and submerged coastlines. “We need a fundamental shift in our national priorities. There’s too much to risk to belittle climate change,” Inslee said. “You cannot overstate the scope of what needs to be done. We literally have to decarbonize our economy in the next few decades. That’s a huge transition. It’s the largest economic change in history. “I think there’s only one potential candidate who views this as the paramount issue, one candidate who wrote a book on it, only one candidate who has experience as an executive doing these things. That’s me. I sense timidity from others because it hasn’t been done before, but we need to go pedal to the metal.” Twelve years ago, as a US congressman, Inslee co-authored a book that compared the effort of eliminating planet-warming emissions to the Apollo space project launched by John F Kennedy. He’s since attempted to distill these ambitions into policy in Washington – he has been governor since 2013 – by pushing forward plans to expand renewable energy, cut emissions from buildings and promote electric cars. In a state stuffed with progressives who savor their lush forest surrounds, this agenda has by and large received nods of approval. Inslee was comfortably re-elected in 2016. The governor is now looking to an outsider’s run in 2020, centering his campaign on tackling the unfolding disasters of climate change while the worst can still be averted. He hopes that growing public concern over climate change will encourage people to view it as an existential emergency that requires a vast national mobilization. A record proportion of Americans – 59% in a recent Yale poll – say they are alarmed or concerned by climate change, having recently seen colossal hurricanes hurtle into Texas, Puerto Rico, Florida and the Carolinas, record wildfires raze vast tracts of California and a string of warm years spawn unbearable heatwaves across the country. Clear majorities, when asked, also support levying a carbon tax on fossil fuel companies and agree that protecting the environment is more important than economic growth. Despite this, many Republicans continue to ridicule climate science and paint any sweeping remedies as fanciful. Many Democrats, meanwhile, have been galvanized by the idea of a Green New Deal, headed by the new congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, although the leading presidential contenders have yet to make climate change a central issue. “We need to blow the bugle on this,” Inslee said. “The Green New Deal is exciting. It raises ambitions and alerts people to the scale of the problem, the scope of it. This wouldn’t be a one-note candidacy; it touches on everything from national security to asthma.” Inslee is attempting to drape the monumental challenge posed by climate change in comforting, familiar garb, pointing to his love of hiking, gulping in clean air gazing at snow-capped mountains and enjoying salmon fishing. These homespun enjoyments are under threat. “The forest fires were so grotesque last year that we had the worst air in the world in Washington,” Inslee said. “We were choking. It’s a very personal thing for me.” Inslee, 68, hopes Americans will be similarly inspired by the moon landings when contemplating a scenario in which, scientists say, the world must completely revolutionize the way we farm, transport ourselves and generate electricity within a few decades to avoid catastrophe. “This is about the American character as much as it is about chemistry and physics,” Inslee said. “It’s about igniting core convictions of Americans, that we can be innovators rather than anchoring ourselves to old industries.” It’s still unclear, however, whether Americans will want to vote for policies to enable this vision. In November’s midterm elections, voters in Washington state rejected a fresh attempt to implement the country’s first carbon tax. The Inslee-backed initiative lost following a hefty campaign against the measure funded by the oil industry. A separate cap on carbon is in place but may be removed by the state supreme court in March. Another setback in this green, economically robust state would raise further questions over the national viability of bold climate policies. Inslee is a “kind of a square peg in a round hole because he wants to be a carbon warrior”, said the Washington state senator Doug Ericksen, a Republican. “Washington state already has an extremely low carbon footprint.” Perhaps a more realistic goal for Inslee than capturing the Democratic nomination would be to help shift focus on to climate change following years of political and media inertia on the issue. “There will be a lot of lip service to climate change but a lot of the candidates won’t be able to tell a toaster from a solar panel,” said Nick Abraham, who campaigned for the carbon tax and now works at the Washington Environmental Council. “Jay Inslee has been nothing but consistent that this has been his No 1 priority. He’s walked the walk.”"

"The controversial Rocky Hill coalmine in the Hunter Valley will not go ahead after a landmark ruling in the land and environment court on Friday that cited the impact it would have had on climate change. Chief judge Brian Preston dismissed an appeal by Gloucester Resources, which was seeking to overturn a New South Wales government decision to reject an open-cut mine because of its impact on the town of Gloucester, north of Newcastle.  The Environmental Defenders Office joined the case last April, arguing on behalf of its client, Groundswell Gloucester, that the mine’s detrimental impact on climate change and on the social fabric of the town should be considered as part of the merit appeal. David Morris, the chief executive of EDO NSW, called the decision “momentous” and said it would be “profoundly influential” in the approval of future fossil fuel projects. “It’s very difficult to see how any future coal project avoids the judge’s finding about this being the wrong time for it,” he said. In his judgment, Preston explicitly cited the project’s potential impact on climate change, writing that an open-cut coalmine in the Gloucester Valley “would be in the wrong place at the wrong time”. “Wrong place because an open cut coal mine in this scenic and cultural landscape, proximate to many people’s homes and farms, will cause significant planning, amenity, visual and social impacts,” he wrote. “Wrong time because the GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions of the coal mine and its coal product will increase global total concentrations of GHGs at a time when what is now urgently needed, in order to meet generally agreed climate targets, is a rapid and deep decrease in GHG emissions. These dire consequences should be avoided. The project should be refused.” In a “first of its kind” hearing, the EDO had argued that the mine should be refused in part because of its impact on Australia’s commitments to the Paris climate agreement. In his judgment, Preston noted that while there was “no proscription” on the approval of new emissions sources such as coalmines under the agreement, approval of the project “cannot assist in achieving the rapid and deep reductions in GHG emissions that are necessary” to meet the goals of the agreement. “It matters not that the aggregate of the project’s greenhouse gas emissions may represent a small fraction of the global total”, he said. “The global problem of climate change needs to be addressed by multiple local actions to mitigate emissions by sources and remove greenhouse gases by sinks.” He rejected GRL’s argument that the project should be allowed because emissions from the mine would be abated by other emissions reductions schemes as “speculative and hypothetical”. “There is no evidence before the court of any specific and certain action to ‘net out’ the GHG emissions of the project,” he wrote in his judgment. “A consent authority cannot rationally approve a development that is likely to have some identified environmental impact on the theoretical possibility that the environmental impact will be mitigated or offset by some unspecified and uncertain action at some unspecified and uncertain time in the future.” The judgment also rejected the mine on the grounds of its visual impact and the social impact of factors such as dust and noise on the surrounding community. Morris said the ramifications would be felt by state and federal ministers and other decision makers who assess fossil fuel projects. “This is necessarily a case-specific judgment. It relates to this coalmine proposed in the Gloucester Valley,” Morris said. “It is persuasive, influential but it is not binding on any future decision. “But it will weigh heavily on the minds of decision makers.” He said the judge’s comment that the mine was being proposed at the “wrong time” was “applicable to every fossil fuel project that’s proposed in this country and internationally going forward.” Morris said Australia was increasingly approaching a moment when approval of a fossil fuel project could be considered “unreasonable”. “And unreasonableness is a ground of legal challenge,” he said. Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie also welcomed the decision. “The NSW Land and Environment court has effectively ruled that coal – just like tobacco and asbestos – is bad for us,” McKenzie said. “I’m thrilled to see the law catching up with the science. “If I was proposing to build a coal mine right now, I’d be feeling pretty nervous.” NSW planning minister Anthony Roberts was asked for the government’s reaction to the court’s decision. “That is the legal process and we respect the court’s decision,” he said. A spokesman for the NSW planning and environment department said the department was pleased the court had agreed with its recommendation on the proposed coal mine. He said the decision supported the current process of assessing developments on a case-by-case basis. In 2017, the independent planning commission rejected the mine because of its proximity to the town of Gloucester, its visual impact, and contravention of the city’s zoning plans. “The judgment confirms the Department of Planning and Environment was correct in its decision to recommend refusal of the application to the Independent Planning Commission, and the Commission was correct to refuse the application,” the spokesman said. “This decision shows NSW has a robust and transparent planning process that is delivering the best outcomes for the whole community.” "
"It is not just the insects that are in serious decline, but also the entomologists who study them (Plummeting insect numbers threaten collapse of nature, 11 February), both in terms of promoting and conserving beneficial species and combating pests. In 2016, I had an article published in the scientific literature entitled Insect biology – a vulnerable discipline?, highlighting the good that insects do as well as the bad, and how necessary research is on insects, but also how this has been eroded for many years by reductions in both government and industrial funding. For example, Rothamsted Research in Hertfordshire, where I spent most of my career, used to have a thriving entomological research community working on various aspects concerning the role of insects in the agroecosystem. However, especially since the early years of this century, most of this vital work has been terminated due to severe cutbacks in funding, with very few projects surviving. In my view, considering the importance of insects as described in your article, renewed funding is urgently required to continue such essential exploration of insect science in all its diversity.Hugh LoxdaleHonorary visiting professor, School of Biosciences, University of Cardiff  • A stark warning has again been issued by scientists over the catastrophic damage that intensive chemical farming and the use of agricultural pesticides is doing to wildlife, insects, nature and the environment. Not only that but these highly toxic agrochemicals are already known to be causing devastating damage to the health and lives of rural residents and communities around the world, as pesticides have been associated with a catalogue of chronic health conditions including neurological diseases, various cancers, respiratory problems and others. Pesticides are poisons and should never have been used in the production of food in the first place, and certainly not for spraying where people live and breathe, especially babies, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people already ill and/or disabled. A vital amendment to the agriculture bill has recently been tabled by Caroline Lucas for the prohibition of agricultural pesticides near residents’ homes, schools, nurseries, and hospitals, among other areas. Now is the time for MPs – especially those in rural constituencies – to also sign up to and support this crucial amendment. Removing toxic chemicals completely from food production would protect not only the health of rural residents and communities, as well as other members of the public, but also the environment, wildlife, pollinators, and other species that – as the new global scientific review has rightly identified – are being wiped out from the continued use of such toxic chemicals.Georgina DownsUK Pesticides Campaign, Chichester, West Sussex • Stating that the rate of extinction of insects is eight times faster than that of mammals, birds and reptiles is highly misleading. I have shown the rate of extinction of many insect groups is remarkably close to that of terrestrial vertebrates, at least for areas and insects for which we have good data. Indeed, birds may be the best indicators of rates of terrestrial species extinction overall – enabling rapid assessment of priority areas. Population loss, which is what you are describing, is of less concern than extinction, because extinction cannot be reversed. Fortunately, population loss can sometimes be reversed – particularly by rewilding. Moreover, some of the reported population “collapses” are disputable, as in Puerto Rico, because they confound insect abundance with reduced activity. It can be argued we are in a mass extinction event – but not on this evidence.Clive HamblerLecturer in biological and human sciences, Hertford College, University of Oxford • Your excellent editorial (A silent global catastrophe is under way among the insects all other life needs, 12 February) alerts us to this looming catastrophe. But you let us off the hook by suggesting that change relies on individual actions. These are not enough. The crisis needs more than this from us. We need to act together as warriors for a humanity threatened by gathering climate breakdown. Everything needs to change, as Naomi Klein spells out so brilliantly in This Changes Everything. We should eat organic food, of course, but also join a movement like Extinction Rebellion and harass our MPs to take the planet seriously.Alastair SawdayPublisher, Bristol • Your two editorials of 12 February expose the, perhaps insurmountable, problem in addressing the environmental catastrophes we face. The first editorial demanded policies to create more economic growth, ie more consumption, while the second stated a few paragraphs later that “we must consume less in every way”. No one seems to have noticed the blatant contradiction. It is a contradiction fundamental to all attempts by our current economic and social systems to address the existential ecological crisis confronting humanity.Stephen SmithGlasgow • If that innocent cow pictured in your article on insect decline had been an organic creature, she would have been outside eating grass, feeding myriad insects on her blood and cowpats. In turn swallows and swifts would be feeding on the same insects. If grazing animals are banished from fields and moorlands and mountains, the insects will never survive the predations wrought on them by pesticides in the arable fields. The answer is of course organic mixed farming. Crops in this system are grown without artificial fertilisers derived from petrochemicals but depend on healthy and vigorous soil nourished by animal manure. Growing strong on this, in a proper rotation, they resist insect damage.Penelope ReidWantage, Oxfordshire • Many of us Scots are hoping, always hoping, that the female highland midge will become extinct in Scotland.Alistair CantEdinburgh • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"It’s a very singular irony that in a world populated like never before, loneliness has become the disease du jour. But you are not alone, if you don’t want to be. No matter who you are and where you are, there is a like-minded soul out there, a sympathetic voice, a support group, a project, a fellowship.  That’s what young people in England found when it turned out medical interventions for mental illness in their region were inadequate. They formed a support group and helped each other. It’s also what struggling students from deprived communities have learned, thanks to an initiative that pairs them with successful professionals for a extra tuition. In a sense, the “you are not alone” message was also delivered live on television to the LGBTQ community by an international sports star, a bold act of principle that did more for his sport than any athletic prowess could.

"Environmental campaigners have issued a challenge to Pope Francis: go vegan for Lent and receive $1m for the charity of his choice. The purpose of the Million Dollar Vegan campaign, led by 12-year-old Genesis Butler, is to encourage people to eat less meat and dairy in order to fight climate change. Global warming cannot be beaten without huge cuts in meat eating in rich nations, research shows, while reducing consumption of animal products also tackles pollution and the destruction of forests and wildlife. The Pope, leader of the world’s 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, has been outspoken on environmental issues. “Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic [and] political,” he said in his 2015 encyclical. He also  told the UN in the same year: “The ecological crisis, and the large-scale destruction of biodiversity, can threaten the very existence of the human species.” Butler, from Long Beach, California, has been vegan since the age of six and has staged many protests against animal cruelty. She said there were many reasons for eating a plant-based diet. “There is an animal side, a health side and an environmental side,” she told the Guardian. “If I tell people about the damage that the animal agriculture industry is doing to the planet, then some of them want to go vegan. I also tell them about health and how when you go vegan it can help prevent cancer, heart, disease and diabetes, or how animals have to die or suffer.” The campaign is backed by celebrities including Paul McCartney, the actor Mena Suvari, the musician Moby and naturalist and TV presenter Chris Packham. Young environmental protesters are becoming increasingly high profile, with Greta Thunberg’s school strikes for climate inspiring tens of thousands of other students to follow suit. In her message to Pope Francis, Butler says: “In your encyclical letter, Laudato si’, you stated that every effort to protect and improve our world will involve changes in lifestyle, production, and consumption. I agree with all my heart and seek your support in tackling one of the largest underlying causes of the problems we face: animal agriculture.” Matthew Glover, CEO of Million Dollar Vegan and who co-founded the Veganuary campaign, said the Pope had been selected for his environmental leadership and influence, particularly in South America, where great forests continue to be cut down. “We are launching this deliberately bold, audacious campaign to jolt our world leaders from their complacency,” Glover said. “We are thankful that Pope Francis has spoken out and that is why we are humbly asking him to try vegan for Lent, and set an example of how each of us can align our principles of caring and compassion with our actions.” The $1m has been donated by the Blue Horizon International Foundation, the charitable arm of the Blue Horizon Corporation, which invests in companies producing plant-based foods and aims to “accelerate the removal of animals from the global food chain”. Lent is a period of about 40 days that ends just before Easter and during which many Christians practise abstinence of some kind. It reflects the Bible story of the 40 days Jesus spent fasting in the desert and in 2019 runs from 6 March to 18 April. The Vatican had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Daniel Hale, at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “Pope Francis has been the standout world leader on climate change this decade. Like all Christians, the Holy Father will make his own choices about how to give, act and pray this Lent. “It’s a period of reflection for all Catholics and a chance for us to respond to the Pope’s call for us to live a simpler and more sustainable lifestyle in various ways,” he said. “For some, that will mean cutting down on meat, while others are switching to renewable energy or campaigning for action to reduce emissions.” Packham said: “We’ve made an enormous mess of this precious little planet in all sorts of ways. [Million Dollar Vegan] is important, brilliant and audacious. If the head of the Catholic church can be vegan for [Lent], think of the message that will send to all of those followers across the world.” Butler’s activism began early. “When I was about to turn four I asked my mom about where we got our chicken nuggets from, because I would always eat them,” she said. “I was devastated. I told her that I never wanted to eat meat again. But I still love chicken nuggets – the vegan version – and I love vegan mac’n’cheese.”"
"One minute we are all in court watching interminable CCTV footage of me in a car getting pulled over by police on Bondi Road, and the next minute we are all sitting in darkness. The power is out. The courtroom has gone black. It’s a brown-out – caused by stress on the electricity grid due to the Thursday’s extreme heat in Sydney. In the sun all the cops, defendants, solicitors and a TV crew stand under a paltry few trees. The temperature is around 40 degrees and the air feels viscous and substantial. Our case is eventually moved into the main courtroom in the city. There would be millions of these tiny vignettes being told all over Australia this summer, small stories of the things that happen to us (and happen to our infrastructure and our environment) in the heat. They are stories about the way things break down, or are interrupted or are made difficult because of the heat. But these vignettes all add up to something, a sort of mosaic that shows us what it is like to live in this country at this moment. In this heat we live cautiously and reactively. We plan around the weather. Even if it’s not as dramatic as a court being closed mid-case, the rhythms of our daily life are changing. We’ll avoid going outside, particularly when the heat is at its most intense. We’ll use our cars more instead of walking, we’ll head to a shopping mall rather than the beach. We’ll move slower, do less. Psychologically the heat is also having an effect. Over 35 degrees, and our sleep is interrupted, we exercise less, and feel more irritable. Domestic violence cases rise.  I’ve had only two nights at my house this summer. I’m a climate change refugee of sorts In extreme heat, our worlds shrink to a manageable size. Give us a chilled room and a cold drink, and we can sit there all day, waiting for a cool change. Without the chilled room, there is discomfort – even suffering. I’ve had only two nights at my house this summer. I’m a climate change refugee of sorts. I can’t stay there right now, it’s too hot – and so I’ve sought out places that are around 10 degrees cooler, and on the coast. My house is old and not air-conditioned in inland Victoria, and for almost two months now the temperature there has been in the 30s and 40s. The mornings start cool but the days heat up and reach their zenith around 6 or 7pm and don’t drop much at night. Relief from this type of heat used to be found up the road in a dam, but when I swam there last week, the water was warm, thick and brackish, like swimming in something with the consistency and temperature of blood. My garden is fried, while inside the fans turn warm air but provide little relief. I suppose I’ll relent and get air conditioning – but isn’t that the sort of thinking that got us here in the first place? Australia in summer is morphing from what currently exists in our popular imagination of long days at the beach, to long days indoors. January has been our hottest month on record. In short, we are becoming more like Dubai and less like the version of ourselves that existed 10 year ago. Dubai, where the summer temperature hits 50 degrees, is a hellscape where life is lived mostly indoors. Residents, particularly moneyed expats, don’t so much live in Dubai over the summer as exist in a climate-controlled version of it. They spend time in cars going between their offices, homes and the mall - and buildings are connected via air conditioned walkways. Leisure time is spent not outdoors or in nature, but in indoor play centres and gyms or enjoying long hotel brunches, where for a fixed price (and fixed temperature) it’s bottomless glasses of Veuve and all-you-can-eat buffet. Dubai shows you can build an alternate reality that ignores the actual reality of what is happening out there – that it is 50 degrees and dangerously hot. And of course building that reality around the climate is an intensely neo-liberal exercise. The rich are comfortable in the cool indoors, the poor bake outside, on boiling building sites and in substandard accommodation. Australian summers have long had their heatwaves and the odd day that is freakishly hot but this summer feels different. It feels different because it is. The run of hot days in a row are longer, and hotter. The minimum temperatures are rising, and it doesn’t cool down dramatically at night. Records are tumbling all over the place. In Melbourne last week, when I left the tennis to get a tram, it was 41 degrees at 6pm, and the air was so hot and dry that being outside felt like being placed in a kiln, and the idea of anything more than five minutes in it seemed dangerous. The streets of Melbourne that evening were empty except for people like me, scurrying as quickly as they could from one cool place to the next. But yet there still exists in the popular imagination this idea of Australia being the land of the glorious summer. Of long beach days and life lived outdoors. Instead it’s been the summer of dead fish clogging warm rivers, while we watch the devastation on television, inside our chilled houses. When will we acknowledge that our summer selves are more akin to those of Dubai’s residents than our former all-day-at-the-beach selves? That we seek cool, dark places now? That Australia has become too hot? Because things are only going to get worse. • Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"As part of a pioneering move to reduce plastic waste, the Guardian’s print edition will no longer be sold in plastic packaging. Behind the scenes, the team behind this big change were Richard Furness, managing director of reader revenue and publishing, Mylene Sylvestre, director of publishing, Roger Clapham, head of supply chain, and Dave Kirwan, the production director for publishing. Here they explain how they did it.  Richard We are in a constant, inquiring conversation with our readers about what they’d like to see from us, and the genesis of this project really came from conversations with them in which they asked how we might adapt our product to be more environmentally friendly. We introduced polybagging about 20 years ago, when our weekend edition started to get bigger and bulkier with extra supplements. It was the only way we could get them out on time and guarantee they would survive the British weather! Over time we tried to improve the plastic we were using, making it thinner, more recyclable, etcetera, but it was still plastic, and still not good enough. It took a bit of time to get the project off the ground – we are always very conscious of balancing commerciality with our values. It’s clear 2019 is a hugely important year in terms of cutting plastics use across the board. It felt urgent, so we didn’t want to wait for regulation or wait and hope someone else solves the problem. Dave Last year we used approximately 25 tonnes of plastic for wrapping, which is about half a tonne a week. We knew we had to find an alternative. The newsprint we use for newspapers, however, is more than 70% recycled, and sourced in a way that retains biodiversity, which is really important to us. The new compostable wrapping film we now use is made from waste potatoes left out of the food chain in Eastern and Northern Europe, it is processed to release the starch and manufactured into granules.Mylene The decision to do away with our plastic wrappers came at a time when the Guardian was trying to cut costs, and when we had just completed a transition to the new tabloid format, so it had to be as inexpensive as possible. In the end, the overall wrapping cost has gone up a little, but we see it very much as an investment and decided to invest in compostable wrapping despite increasing our operations costs. Mylene It’s been about 10 months in the making, all told. We needed something that could be produced quickly for each edition, so as not to delay distribution of the paper. We originally tried to move to a paper substitute for the wrapper, but found that it wouldn’t stand up against the elements too well, so wouldn’t be suitable for home deliveries. It was actually our environment journalists who suggested we try potato starch – a material they had seen being used by the RSPB, the National Trust and others. Richard It’s been really fascinating to learn about the process. Our early prototypes underwent intensive tests to see how quickly they could move through the printing presses, how the text looked, how robust it was. We discovered we were only allowed to have ink covering a maximum of 5% of the surface of the wrapper in order to keep it compostable, so that was a challenge too. Dave The material itself is called Bioplast 300 and is made using compounded potato starch, mixed with the other ingredients (biodegradable polyesters and additives). Bioplast 300 does not contain volatile or GM ingredients and is 100% biodegradable. The bio granules are extruded and blown into film, in the same way conventional plastics are made. Richard We decided to launch it in London and the home counties first, as a live test to see how it was received. But after the overwhelmingly positive response we have had from readers, we plan to roll it out nationally from April this year. Guardian Weekly subscribers across UK and Europe will also start seeing the new wrapper on their editions very soon. Mylene It needs to go in the compost bin or garden waste after it’s been used. Some councils still don’t offer proper facilities for this, so people need to lobby their local councils to implement these services as soon as possible! Mylene Happily, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. We didn’t have a huge PR drive around the new wrapper as it hasn’t quite yet been rolled out to all our readers, and so many people got in touch to say it had been a lovely surprise when they got to the newsagent. It made me laugh when one reader commented on Twitter that she thought this was “the most Guardian thing ever!”.Richard There has been a global reaction, as word has spread about the project online, with people sending us messages – often copying in their local publication and lobbying them to follow suit. Several publishers have been in touch to ask about our suppliers. We are actively sharing our methodology and details of our partners: the environment is an issue that’s extremely close to our hearts and it would be great if more publications followed suit. I think many simply didn’t know the technology exists – and, similarly, this project has highlighted the lack of general knowledge around composting. So there’s a lot of work to be done by readers too, in getting the word out there! Richard We are always looking for ways to innovate and improve the supply chain. We have recently moved one of the magazine production sites from mainland Europe to the UK, and we share our distribution routes with other papers, so we no longer have our own vehicles. Our distribution manager Roger Clapham is instrumental in making this process work so efficiently. Richard Readers have a deep attachment to the paper, and understandably so – it’s news at a different pace to so much of modern life, and as such, it can provide a bit of respite from it. The chance to carve out some time at the weekend for the papers is one of life’s pleasures, and we know from research that our print readers really value the tangible nature of print.  "
"Tony Abbott is in danger of losing his seat of Warringah to independent candidate Zali Steggall, according to a poll. The barrister and former Olympic ski champion is leading the former prime minister 54% to 46% on a two-party-preferred basis, according to a ReachTEL poll of 622 residents commissioned by activist group GetUp and published in the Sun-Herald and the Sunday Age on Sunday.  In the poll, 60% of the residents canvassed rated Abbott’s performance as a local member as “poor”. And 78% of those who had voted for him previously said they would vote for someone else. GetUp is campaigning to oust Abbott from the Sydney northern beaches seat he has held for 25 years. In an interview published on Sunday, Abbott criticised his opponents in Warringah as “all negative”. “I’m very much aware that one of the mooted independent candidates said that she was running to stop me becoming leader of the opposition and prime minister,” he said in reference to Alice Thompson, a former employee of Malcolm Turnbull, who has since pulled out of the contest to back Steggall. “These people just can’t help themselves. They are all negative. They don’t know what they’re for, but by God, they know what they’re against.” Steggall, who has vowed to fight Abbott on his stance on climate change, has also challenged Labor to adopt a more ambitious climate change policy and commit to blocking Adani’s Carmichael coalmine. “The attention should be with renewables, technology, clean transport, clean energy – not projects like Adani,” she told Guardian Australia last week. But on Sunday Abbott said “if you look at the polls, climate change rates no more strongly today than it did a decade or so back” and he also questioned Steggall’s climate change policy. “What’s her policy on climate change? My government presided over policies which mean that we will overachieve our Kyoto target and we’re well and truly on track to achieve the Paris target. What’s her policy?” Abbott said. “It’s quite possible [the Coalition] might go back to Direct Action and renew the Emissions Reduction Fund.” Private polling conducted for the environment movement and for the major parties suggests community concern about climate change is currently sitting at levels not seen since the federal election cycle in 2007. Steggall told Guardian Australia last week that climate change had become “a political football” and voters were desperate for action. “I’ll be advised by experts, I’m not an expert on climate change, I’m a concerned resident,” she said. “To me, this is something that needs to be bipartisan, [the policy] needs to be supported by facts and experts and across industries so we can come up with a strategy that has longevity – a long-term plan.” Steggall, who entered the contest in Warringah in late January, said her fundraising goals and volunteer sign-ups were running ahead of expectations. She described the contest against Abbott as “a huge mountain to hope to climb, but you’ve got to set the goal high, and if the current level of dissatisfaction is high enough, that’s how people can really make their voice heard”."
"BP has bowed to pressure from investors, including the Church of England, by backing a plan to explain how its strategy and investments are consistent with the Paris climate agreement. The UK oil and gas company supported a resolution, put forward by a group of shareholders including the investment arms of HSBC, Legal & General and the C of E, forcing it to be more transparent on climate change.  But BP urged investors to reject a tougher climate resolution brought by a Dutch shareholder activist group, which it said was too prescriptive. The moves are part of a wider, growing wave of shareholder power being exerted on oil and gas companies to be clearer about their contribution to rising carbon emissions, and what they are doing about it. BP will encourage shareholders at its AGM in May to back the resolution organised by the Climate Action 100+ group, which represents 320 investors managing more than $32tn (£24tn) of assets. The proposal calls for BP to publish a business strategy in line with two of the Paris deal goals by the end of its 2019 financial year: holding temperature rises to well below 2C and reducing carbon emissions to net zero by the second half of the century. The company has also been told to justify how capital expenditure in fossil fuel projects was consistent with the landmark climate deal, and set new metrics and targets. BP and the investors spent months in talks over the resolution, leading to some changes to the proposal but not on the core demand of a business strategy in line with Paris. The two sides disagreed on whether the company had shown it was consistent with the goals of the climate accord. Investors said BP was yet to demonstrate that. Helge Lund, BP’s chairman, said: “The additional reporting specified in the resolution will build on BP’s history of progressive action in this area.” The company agreed four years ago to be more transparent about reporting on climate risks. The resolution said: “Investors remain concerned that the company has not yet demonstrated that its strategy, which includes growth in oil and gas as well as pursuing low-carbon businesses, is consistent with the Paris goals.” The company’s contribution to climate change could also undermine its stated mission of lifting people out of poverty because of the impact of global warming on the world’s poorest people, the investors added. However, Bruce Duguid, the lead coordinator of the resolution and the head of stewardship at Hermes EOS, welcomed BP’s decision to back the proposal. “This is good news for both investors and the planet,” he said. BP has not specified what metrics and targets it might set if the resolution is passed, but they could include targets for the carbon intensity of its products and linking executives’ bonuses to carbon emission cuts. But the company will not be setting targets any time soon for “scope 3 emissions” produced by customers using its products, such as burning petrol in a car. These emissions are much bigger than those from the company’s operations. BP said it was not supporting a separate resolution, brought by the Dutch investor group Follow This, seeking to make BP set a goal for scope 3 emissions. The group has previously been credited with influencing Shell’s decision to set such targets."
"Spend enough time in Churchill, and you will hear the stories. Of hearing a noise outside, pulling open the drapes and seeing a polar bear looking in through the window.  Of walking around a corner at night, coming face-to-face with a bear and, implausibly, scaring it off with the strobe light on a cellphone. Of encountering an old man with a walker, determinedly clacking past a puzzled bear that peered at him from behind a rock and muttering defiantly: “If it gets me, it gets me.” Of being about to, against all better judgment, walk the couple of hundred yards from restaurant to hotel room at night, only to be pulled back by a warning that a pair of polar bears had been spotted across the street. (OK, the last story is mine. The line between being a teller of tales and the subject of an obituary can be thinner than one might like.) Such is everyday life, particularly during October and November, in this small town on the shores of Canada’s Hudson Bay. A little more than 1,000 miles north of the provincial capital of Winnipeg, Churchill is not just remote, it is defiantly so, accessible overland only by rail, its residents bonded by the conjoined challenges of living on the fringes of the Arctic and sharing their streets with the largest land carnivore in the world. “If you were to build a town today, you would never put it here,” explains Geoff York of Polar Bears International, a research and advocacy organization whose members, understandably, spend much time in Churchill each year. “Polar bears are creatures of the sea ice, and they come ashore in the summer here when the sea ice on Hudson Bay melts and then they wait for the ice to return.” That return tends to begin sometime in November; by October, the bears are already stirring, wandering in anticipation toward the bay along a route that takes them past, and sometimes directly through, Churchill. From a cold war peak of about 5,000 people, when it hosted a military base, Churchill is now home to roughly 900 year-round inhabitants, slightly more than half of whom are Native. Theirs can be a harsh and at times tenuous existence, one that is leavened by the income from tourists who come to gaze at the northern lights in the winter, paddle among the hundreds of belugas that throng the river in summer and, in October and November, visit the polar bear capital of the world. Polar bears have made Churchill famous, and led to it being dubbed the “jewel of Manitoba” and one of the top destinations in Canada. But as it emerges from the most testing two years in its modern history, Churchill may be about to embark on an entirely different path, as this frequently frigid community considers embracing a warmer future. It is estimated that about 10,000 people descend upon Churchill annually during the five- or six-week “bear season”. The bulk of bear viewing takes place on the tundra outside of town, from the safety of bespoke vehicles approximately the size of school buses atop airport fire truck wheels, the immense size of which enables the trucks to traverse treacherous terrain and keep their occupants beyond the reach of even the largest and most curious bear. The challenge for Churchill residents is to encourage the bears to head to the tundra without tarrying in town. In the past, the policy was less one of deterrence than immediate destruction. “When I was growing up, it was common for conservation officers to shoot 25 bears a season,” explains the mayor, Mike Spence, who is of Cree and Scottish descent. These days, the community, in conjunction with the Manitoba department of conservation, employs a different approach: the Polar Bear Alert Program. Signs around the town remind residents and visitors alike to exercise caution and report bear sightings on the hotline – 675-BEAR. Culvert traps, baited with seal scent, line the perimeter of the community; bears that are caught in them are taken to a holding facility, popularly known as the polar bear jail, where they are held for up to 30 days (without food, to enhance the deterrence factor of the experience), before being drugged and helicoptered to a spot safely away from town – or, if late enough in the season, on to the sea ice. If a bear does make it past the perimeter defense and into town conservation officers’ first plan is to help it on its way, motivating it to leave by firing cracker shells (loud, blank shotgun shells) and following it with vehicles. Only the recalcitrant and the repeat offenders are incarcerated. For residents, living with polar bears is an unavoidable fact of life, and one that instils an understandable caution. As one former resident once said to me with a chuckle: “In Winnipeg, they say you can tell when someone is from Churchill because they always look carefully before walking around a corner.” House and vehicle doors are always unlocked, should anyone need to fling one open and leap to shelter. As much as they can, residents simply avoid peak bear sites – anywhere along the coast or the riverbanks, in the willows on the edge of town, alleyways – especially at night, and particularly during peak bear season. For some, however, that isn’t always an option. Parker Fitzpatrick works for Manitoba Hydro, the provincial utility company, and if a line is down, he and his team have to repair it, no matter when and where. As a result, they exercise due caution. “You try your hardest to not put yourself in that predicament,” he explains. “But if you have to go out in an area that’s a bad area or where bears have been spotted, and there’s a line down, I always get resources: set up security fences, for example, and carry shotguns with cracker shells. Ninety per cent of bears won’t bother you at all, but there are some who are hungry or are curious and want to bat you around like a baseball.” Since the establishment of the Polar Bear Alert Program in 1983, serious attacks have been rare. There has been just one fatality, during the program’s first season: a homeless man, Tommy Mutanen, was rummaging through the freezer of a fire-damaged motel, stuffing meat into his pockets, when he rounded a corner and bumped into a bear. Nearby residents heard his screams, but although they rushed to his aid, they could not make the bear stop his attack, and by the time they shot it, Mutanen was dead. There has, however, been one exceptionally close shave. Erin Greene first arrived in Churchill from her native Montreal in 2012; she planned to spend a few months working at a local restaurant and then go back home, but she liked it so much she returned to stay the following summer. “And then,” she said, “I got mauled by a polar bear.” On Halloween night 2013, Greene and two friends were walking home in the early hours from a party when, she later recalled: “We all looked and there was a polar bear that was barreling down the street, just running towards us. Our first instinct was to run.” Her friends escaped, but the bear caught Greene and grabbed her by the head and shoulders, tearing off part of her scalp as it tossed her around like a rag doll. As blood poured down her body, Erin was convinced she was going to die, and she might well have done, had it not been for a 69-year-old man with a shovel named Bill Ayotte. Ayotte heard Greene’s screams and, clad only in a sweater and his pyjamas, ran toward the scene and brought his shovel down as hard as he could between the bear’s eyes. The bear dropped Greene, who scrambled toward the safety of Ayotte’s house, and turned its attention to Ayotte instead, tearing off an ear and clamping down on a leg. Other residents arrived, firing cracker shells and, ultimately, driving at the bear with headlights flashing and horn blazing, sending it off. Greene and Ayotte were airlifted to Winnipeg. Greene’s scalp was repaired; Ayotte’s ear was reattached. Both spent weeks recuperating in the hospital; both returned to Churchill. Today, Greene teaches yoga in the community; during bear season, she works at a gift shop and, in the summer months, leads standup-paddleboard tours on to the river when the belugas are at their peak. She could not, I suggest, have been blamed had she elected not to return to the scene of such an ordeal. “I was trying to heal myself from the trauma I had experienced, and I believe that facing it head on is the way to do it,” she said. Besides, the community had helped pay her medical bills; she could hardly abandon them. “Knowing that this community produced someone who would risk their life to save another person’s, I definitely wanted to be somewhere where humans turned out like that.” The sense of community, of a populace that bonds together and looks out for each other, is a common theme among residents. It was both tested and strengthened over the last two years, when the very viability of Churchill was threatened as never before. It all began with the largest blizzard anyone could recall. The blizzard began on 7 March 2017 and lasted for 57 hours. As the snow fell, it was driven by 120 km/h winds into massive drifts. By the time it was over, drifts in some places were 25 to 30 feet high; “huge stretches” of roads were buried under eight to nine feet of snow. “We had to tunnel out of our house, tunnel up and out,” recalls Sandra Cook, a local artist. “My son Max was 13 at the time, so we figured he was the strongest and the thinnest. So, we dug this tunnel up and sent Max up there. He had to lay down on the top of the snow pile, because he couldn’t stand up [because of the wind], and shovel until [Sandra’s husband] Kevin could get out. Then Kevin and Max went out and started shoveling out others. People were looking out across the street, looking out for neighbors. The whole community came together. Our streets were like tunnels. It was an extraordinary amount of snow.” The response to the blizzard, said Cook, “brought out the best in people”. But the community would face a bigger challenge two months later, one that stretched it to the limit. The snow melted. The melt caused massive flooding which, among other things, damaged the final 249km stretch of the railway track connecting Churchill to Winnipeg and thus the world. An engineering study found 20 washouts and damage in 130 places. The estimated repair bill was $43.5m. OmniTrax, the Colorado-based company that owned the track and which was already looking for a way to offload it, said it couldn’t afford to foot the repairs and wouldn’t. The federal government took the company to court. And Churchill found itself effectively isolated. A week without the train became a month. A month became two, then three, then six, then 18. With no road connection to the outside world, the only way out for residents was a $1,200 round-trip air ticket that few could afford. Everything that the town needed – every nail and screw, every can of beer, every pallet of produce – had to be flown in at exorbitant cost. Residents found themselves with far less cash on hand. Business at some stores in town dropped 90%. The hit to the community was not just financial. “There are kids in this town who haven’t seen their grandparents for a year and nine months,” said Dave Daley, a Métis community leader and owner of a dog mushing company that caters to tourists. “A lot of families constantly go back and forth; there’s been none of that.” The school hockey team had to content itself with practice, because there was no way for them to travel and compete. For some, the uncertain future was too tenuous to risk staying. “I think there were 40 less kids in the school last year,” said Daley. “There were some people struggling with addiction, some families breaking apart,” said Cook. “We had a spurt of crime, which is normally very low here.” The impasse was finally broken when a consortium of industry and First Nations communities banded together as the Arctic Gateway Group to buy the rail track and the port in late August. Repairs to the rail line began almost immediately, and on 31 October last year, the still of the Churchill night was pierced, for the first time in 18 months, by the whistle of an approaching train. “People were just stunned,” recalls Cook. “I was handing out Halloween candy and I suddenly thought, ‘What am I hearing?’ The smiles plastered on people’s faces were unbelievable.” The following day, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, flew into town to formally announce the restoration of the railway and increased funding to improve the line and repair and redevelop the port. A street party celebrated the start of a new chapter. On the deck of the Seaport Hotel, owned by Spence, a sign declared: “The hostages are free.” But with new beginnings come new challenges, and as it emerges from its darkest hour, Churchill finds itself at a crossroads. “I think there’s a bright future for us,” asserts Daley. “But we have to be careful: we don’t want Churchill to lose its identity. I don’t want a road here. The minute we get a road here, we lose our identity and who we are.” Even without a road, that identity may ultimately face a reckoning. The challenge isn’t posed by a renovated railway, but by the prospect of a refurbished and revitalized port, the decrepit husk of which looms over the town. In the past, the port regularly exported grain and provided diesel fuel to remote Nunavut communities, but the new owners have a much grander vision: of links to Europe and India and the possible export of oil and gas. “A few years ago, OmniTrax raised the prospect of shipping oil through the community, and unequivocally the community was resolutely against doing so for a number of reasons, the biggest one being that the shipping industry at the time was ill-equipped to deal with the prospect of accidents or disasters,” said John Gunter of Frontiers North Adventures, one of the premier ecotourism companies in town. “So, it looks like we’ll have to deal with that prospect again in the future.” Of course, for a port in an Arctic environment to become truly viable, it will require shipping lanes that aren’t clogged with ice much of the year; and so Churchill may ultimately find itself as both the most famous home of the ultimate icon of climate change and a community that, in the words of Spence, “will have to take advantage” of that warming climate. “The Northwest Passage offers a 7,000km shortcut from New Jersey to Shanghai,” Murad al-Katib, CEO of Arctic Gateway, said at the railway reopening ceremony. “Churchill is the only commercial deep-water port in northern Canada, and climate change has extended the shipping season.” It is a view cautiously echoed by many in town, even as they express anxiety about not losing what makes Churchill unique. “I’m not against oil, because I think it can be done safely,” said Daley. “With global warming and the strait open more often, I think there’s a market for it. But this is the jewel of Manitoba – it’s the jewel of Canada – and we have to protect it. The port will in time become viable, but our economic future is tourism.” For a community that in the last two years has been buried by snow and cut off from the world, and that even in the best of times must beware of polar bears around the corner, it is just the latest challenge among many. But at least, for now, with the sound of the train whistle regularly reminding the community of its re-connection with the outside world, there is hope. “We find a way; it’s what we do,” saids Cook. “We hang in there, and we’re going to find a way.”"

"Tax authorities across Europe are increasingly asking themselves why, in the digital age, an ordinary citizen would pay tax if they could avoid doing so. Amazon, Facebook, Uber, eBay and Google do all they can to avoid tax. They employ thousands of staff to check every loophole. They also retain the services of the big accounting and global law firms with the sole aim of driving down the effective rate of tax they pay wherever they operate.  So why wouldn’t everyone else do what they could to play the same game? It’s a question that has leapt up the list of pressing issues for tax authorities across Europe. Last week, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is attempting to standardise tax rules across the world’s 34 richest nations, said that its members had agreed to consider benchmarks for taxing digital services. “Countries and jurisdictions will step up efforts toward reaching a global solution to the growing debate over how to best tax multinational enterprises in a rapidly digitalising economy,” it said. It might not seem like much of a victory. The 34 nations in question, ranging from the UK, US and France to Mexico, South Korea and Slovakia, look like climbers that have just reached base camp on their way to conquering Everest. For Pascal Saint-Amans, the OECD director’s of tax policy, it is an obvious move now that digital businesses are viewed by many voters as undermining the very fabric of the tax system. That may be true, but his scheme has become attractive because it represents the slowest route to the summit. Other proposals get there more quickly, and much more painfully for the jurisdictions that play host to tax avoiders – for example Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. To all the EU countries involved, it is a better option than the more draconian rules proposed by Brussels. Just before Christmas, the European commission reheated plans to adopt majority voting for tax rule changes with a view to implementing a new digital tax. This tax, which would tackle corporation tax and VAT avoidance by companies based in Ireland and Luxembourg, is likely to stay tethered to its moorings all the time unanimous voting governs tax issues. Take the case of Ireland. There are corporation tax receipts in its budget, but they are small relative to the number of wealthy companies in Dublin and Cork. The tax-to-GDP ratio in Ireland has decreased from 30.8% in 2000 to 22.8% in 2017. The Irish have already suffered an adverse tax judgment courtesy of the European court of justice, which ruled that it had allowed Apple to avoid €13bn of tax, which must now be collected. The last thing Irish officials want is a switch to majority voting on tax that would trigger a wider clampdown. Britain, in or out of the EU, has promised to press ahead with a modest digital tax. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, says he will join the OECD scheme when it comes to fruition but can’t wait for that moment without making a move. It is a measure of the way digital companies have destroyed a sense of fair play on tax that a Tory government that presides over a financial centre built largely on clever wheezes to avoid tax has stepped forward with a plan in advance of Brussels and the OECD. Hammond knows there is more to gain from righting a wrong on tax than he could lose by upsetting major digital businesses. Other countries should follow his lead. BP has thrown its weight behind an initiative by its own investors to make the company spell out how corporate strategy is compatible with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. That is welcome news. BP has been something of a laggard compared with European peers such as Shell and Total in its efforts to transition away from oil and gas, and reduce its global warming impact. The company and investors, which include Hermes EOS, Legal & General Investment Management and the Church of England, hailed agreement on the resolution as “good news for the planet” and giving “investors better clarity”. Action to tackle climate change is clearly a good thing. But there’s also a risk of dressing up business-as-usual fossil-fuel extraction as progressive action. With that in mind, what exactly is BP committing to here that is new? The main requirement is a business strategy in line with the Paris agreement’s demands of holding temperatures “well below 2C” and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of the century. BP believes its strategy is already consistent with those goals. So why will it feel moved to make any substantive changes when it publishes the new version? The other requirements are that BP weighs how expenditure on new projects, including drilling for oil and gas, is compatible with Paris, and sets metrics and targets to keep in line with the accord’s goals. This is all useful, but it’s debatable whether it will materially change the fact that the company’s investments in solar power and electric cars are a drop in the ocean of its hydrocarbon-dominated $15bn-$16bn spending last year. Or that it wants to be producing 25% more oil and gas by 2021. The growing wave of investor pressure on oil and gas majors to do more on climate change is good news – but the BP resolution also lays bare the limits to engagement. ‘I didn’t think I would end up owning House of Fraser,” Mike Ashley said last year, soon after his Sports Direct paid £90m to buy the department store chain out of administration. And he surely never expected to enter the world of upholstered furniture by buying Sofa.com. Yet the latter deal happened on Friday and is Ashley’s most baffling in his current buying spree. Sofa.com is a supplier to House of Fraser, so one can see the superficial logic, but the business wouldn’t have been up for grabs for a nominal sum if it weren’t struggling. Ashley now has one more headache to solve – this time in an alien (for him) corner of the retail market. He’s getting in deeper and deeper. It is tempting to ascribe a grand plan to this dealmaking, in which the next arrival could be HMV. Is Ashley on a mission to save the high street? Does he just spy cheap opportunities that others are afraid to take? The price tag for House of Fraser suggested Sports Direct got the stock at about 15p in the pound, which certainly has short-term appeal, even before one counts the opportunity to beat up landlords over rents. There will definitely be cold commercial appraisal at work, of course. But one also suspects this is a case of one damn thing leading to another. The losses Ashley suffered on the original 11% stake in House of Fraser will have hurt. He made a bad bet, just as he did with a near-30% stake in Debenhams, on which Sports Direct took a £85m writedown last year. Maybe the motivation (or part of it) is just the gambler’s desire to get even by making bigger bets. It would be a fine thing if Ashley succeeds in his attempt to rejuvenate so many ailing retail businesses, but chasing your losses is rarely a winning strategy."
"If there is one political subject that remains neglected and underestimated because of how we have for centuries run our societies, economies and families, then it is children. Although the experience and process of growing up has in many ways profoundly changed through history, our understanding of children has failed to keep pace. Nothing makes this clearer than the children’s climate strikes. These protests, involving school-age children refusing to attend class to focus the attention of political leaders on the global climate crisis, have spread from Australia to Germany, from Sweden to Belgium; the first strikes in the UK take place on Friday 15 February and in the US later this month. But instead of taking themseriously, many “adults” (usually, though not exclusively old men in leadership positions) are still dismissing them with the utterly paternalistic argument that all these protests are nice and cute, but skipping school? Why can’t the children protest in their “free time”, instead of endangering their own education and their future which we, the adults, supposedly have provided for them.  The most absurd reaction has emerged from Belgium, where an environment minister, Joke Schauvliege, has been forced to resign after claiming that the Belgian children skipping school were being directed by unnamed foreign powers. Schauvliege suggested that the protests were a “set-up” and she falsely claimed that Belgian intelligence had knowledge that the children’s actions were “more than spontaneous actions of solidarity”. There was a paternalistic dismissal of the school protests too from the Australian resources minister, Matt Canavan, who said in a radio interview that the action was setting the children up for failure: “Walking off school and protesting, you don’t learn anything from that.” Meanwhile, consider an interview the German news magazine Der Spiegel did with Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish mastermind of the school strikes movement, who travelled 32 hours by train to get to Davos while the “adults” who were supposed to meet to talk about climate change there arrived in 1,500 private jet flights. The Spiegel journalists flew (although at least not by private jet) to Sweden just to meet Greta and their most pressing question was: who is really behind the girl who’s become an inspiration for children across the world? So, after suggesting to the child that her speeches seem a bit too good to have been written by a kid, they then asked her directly: “Who stands behind Greta”? She patiently answered that she herself is “behind Greta”, and added an important lesson to the journalists and adults: “Some people claim that my parents have brainwashed me, but it was the opposite: I brainwashed my parents. I convinced them not to fly any more and to stop eating meat”. When the journalists asked her whether she found it acceptable that tens of thousands of children were skipping school, Greta, fully aware that the school strikes are the only effective but also somehow “traumatic” part for most of the adults (or world leaders) who are otherwise fine with co-opting the children’s leader as a sort of entertainment at Davos, simply answered: “You have to stop destroying our future.” Faced with the same paternalistic complaint that children shouldn’t be skipping school, 13-year-old US pupil Alexandria Villasenor, who has started walking to the UN in her own climate strike every Friday, speaks in blunt terms: “If we’re not going to have a future, then school won’t matter any more.” She couldn’t be more right. While in Belgium tens of thousands of children have been skipping school to join demonstrations for action against climate change, at the same time, in another corner of Europe, the children of Macedonia have been forced to skip school because of air pollution. This shows that some children are denied school because of the way “adults” manage the world.  What the children’s protests are bringing back is a sort of universalism (children in Belgium are also protesting about the future of the children in Macedonia), but a much-needed debate about the very notion of a common future. For this reason we have to understand this wave of children’s disobedience (even skipping school) as an attempt to literally take back time (the future) from a system that is founded on extraction not only of natural resources, but of time and the future itself. There is a wonderful children’s fantasy novel published in 1973 in German with the full title Momo, or The Strange Story of the Time Thieves and the Kid Who Brought Back Stolen Time to Humans, which deserves new recognition. Not just because it actually imagined such children’s protests, but because it offers a much-needed inversion of “adults” and “children”. It was written by Michael Ende, the author of the more famous The Neverending Story. Momo is not just a surprisingly accurate depiction of the world of acceleration and indebtedness in which we are living today, but a rallying call to resistance to young people. Now it seems, the children’s climate strikes are precisely an answer to the events that started to be unleashed in the 1970s and were best summed up by the famous Sex Pistols song from 1977 No Future. In an interview on German television in 1993, Ende predicted that the world was headed toward either an economic or an ecological catastrophe, that we are, in fact, waging war against our children.  The first war against our youngest citizens is the destruction of the planet, which is the theft of their future; the second war is the overreaction to the current children’s protest. It reflects our western cultural tendency to simultaneously treat children like pets – sentimentalising and infantilising them while at the same time dismissing their concerns. The billionaire business leaders of Davos applauded the Swedish girl at Davos, but from the outside it looked like a sideshow, a piece of diversion, rather than anything that would really cause them to change direction. But what if the children today were considered the true grownups, and the “adults” who are leading the world into an ecological catastrophe – as they fly into an Alpine resort in 1,500 private jets to pay lip service to climate change – were considered the spoiled and dangerous children? If we want to have a future at all, the children of the early 21st century have to be taken seriously – and the adults should join their protests. • Srećko Horvat is a philosopher from Croatia and one of the founders of the Democracy in Europe Movement • This article was amended on 7 February 2019 because the date of the UK school strike was wrong.

"In the wake of mass fish kills in the Menindee Lakes in January and scorching criticism of its stewardship of the Murray-Darling Basin, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has announced that it will upgrade its scientific work on climate change and the river system. The authority’s chief executive, Phillip Glyde, has invited the scientific community to collaborate on its work on climate change.  “The overwhelming scientific consensus is that climate change is currently affecting the Basin so more work is needed to inform future management strategies,” Glyde said. “The MDBA’s discussion paper kicks off the next phase of work to better understand the likely impacts of climate change on the Basin in the future and to identify where the information gaps are.” But the MDBA has strongly rejected the findings of the South Australian Royal Commission into the Murray Darling which accused it of gross maladministration of the plan. It said the royal commission effectively proposed abandoning the basin plan and starting again. “The MDBA considers this would be a reckless act – setting back progress towards a healthy and sustainable Basin, and causing substantial uncertainty for Basin communities,” Glyde said. “While many people support the concept of a Basin Plan, there is often sharp disagreement up and down the rivers, and across different stakeholder groups, about the most appropriate settings,” he said. The MDBA’s role was to apply the best available science, feedback from the community and expert judgement to administer the plan and propose amendments. On Monday a group of eminent scientists convened by the Academy of Science released a report saying that the fish kills at Menindee, which killed up to one million fish, were due to the low flows, caused by over-extraction upstream and exacerbated by the drought. “Our review of the fish kills found there isn’t enough water in the Darling system to avoid catastrophic outcomes,” they warned. The scientists pointed to serious deficiencies in governance and management, which have eroded the intent of the Water Act 2007 and the framework of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. One of the main criticisms of the basin plan by the royal commission and by scientists has been that the MDBA’s models use historical data to assess the variability of flows in the river, but do not take account of how climate change may be permanently altering rainfall and flows in the river system. The models and the whole basin plan was based on work done in 2009 and it did not include any mechanism for taking account of climate change. It is due to be reviewed in 2026, but scientists say there is an urgent need to update the plan and the models that inform it, in light of what is actually happening to the river. The Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists released a report last week, which studied the actual flows at two sites along the river – Wilcannia and Chowilla. It found that actual flows were much lower than those predicted to occur as a result of the plan being implemented. The MDBA says that’s because the plan is partway through but in the case of the floodplains at Chowilla, none of the targets for environmental inundations needed to keep river red gums alive had been reached. Glyde said the basin plan was drafted “as an adaptive plan with climate change in mind” though almost every decision to amend the plan has been about reducing environmental water targets in favour of irrigators. Glyde acknowledged that the information about climate change, particularly in the northern basin, had advanced. “We now know more. Rainfall patterns are changing and these changes will increase pressure on the health of the basin’s environment, its communities and its economy,” he said."
"In your conversation between Oxfam’s Winnie Byanima, Rutger Bregman and Anand Giridharadas (Bursting the billionaire bubble, Review, 9 February), I’m surprised that Byanyima does not take issue with Giridharadas when he says people in Davos say nice things to rich people in the hope of getting invited back. She has been coming since 1996 and hasn’t minced her words once. I doubt too that Greta Thunberg, the environmental activist, had next year’s invite at the forefront of her mind when she accused a room packed with adults of “stealing our future”. Or Guy Ryder from the International Labour Organization, when he called for universal protection for workers in the face of an automation onslaught.  Our own work last month saw us calling out governments for climate inaction, urging businesses to reskill their workers faster and encouraging everyone to eat less meat to reduce carbon emissions. We hold our annual meeting in January to set an agenda for the year ahead. This is why we will keep on inviting people like Byanyima and Bregman to help us define the priorities. Now that Davos is over, it’s time for the real work to begin – redesigning social safety nets, taxation, job creation and bringing about a reskilling revolution. If we can build a fairer, more inclusive society we have a chance of solving climate change and other longstanding problems. Not even Giridharadas could deny that would be a win-win.Oliver CannWorld Economic Forum  • Thank you for your article about the school climate strikes movement started by Greta Thunberg (Thousands of pupils to strike across UK next week, 9 February).

"Australia sweltered through the hottest month in its history in January, spurring mass deaths of fish, fire warnings and concerns among climate scientists that extreme heat is hitting faster and harder than anticipated. For the first time since records began, the country’s mean temperature in January exceeded 30C (86F), according to the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), which said daily extremes – in some places just short of 50C – were unprecedented. “There’s been so many records it’s really hard to count,” said Andrew Watkins, a senior climatologist at BoM, after January registered Australia’s warmest month for mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. This followed the country’s warmest December on record, with heatwaves in every Australian state and territory. With colour-coded heat maps of the country resembling blazing red furnaces for much of the month, the authorities have recently issued a special report on the extraordinary heat. A persistent high-pressure system in the Tasman Sea that blocked cold fronts and cooler air from reaching the country’s south, and a delayed monsoon in the north, contributed to the heatwave. Climate change is the long-term driver. “The warming trend which has seen Australian temperatures increase by more than 1C in the last 100 years also contributed to the unusually warm conditions,” Watkins said. The bureau’s monthly report said the heatwaves were unprecedented in their scale and duration. The highest temperatures of the month were recorded in Port Augusta in South Australia, where thermometers registered 49.5C , but the most relentless heat was in Birdsville, Queensland, which endured 10 consecutive days above 45C. Tasmania, where emergency services have been battling bushfires throughout the past month, had its driest ever January. Watkins said Borrona Downs in north-west New South Wales broke the record for hottest minimum temperature, registering one night at 36.6C. This has a major impact on ecosystems that have not been able to cool down during the night as is normally the case. This was compounded by drought. Large parts of Australia received only 20% of their normal rainfall, particularly throughout the south-east in Victoria and parts of NSW and South Australia. Menindee in far-west NSW had four days in a row of temperatures above 47C. This was the site of December and January’s mass fish kills on the Darling River. Hundreds of thousands of native fish, including Murray cod, golden perch and bony bream, died around the Menindee weir. The authorities blamed “thermal stratification” as sudden shifts in temperature – first hot, then cold – caused algae blooms and choked the water of oxygen. After the most recent fish die-off on 27 January, the Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said the Murray-Darling was “facing the makings of an ecological disaster”. He said: “This is not standard, this is not normal. This is a disaster.” In parts of western Queensland and western NSW, there have been long strings of more than 40 days of temperatures above 40C. Cloncurry had 43 days in a row that exceeded 40C. Birdsville had 16 days in January of temperatures higher than 45C including 10 days in a row. NSW, the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and the Northern Territory all had their warmest January on record. The meteorological agency has warned that temperatures are set to rise further in the years ahead as a result of climate change. In its report last month, it said warming was contributing to a long-term increase in the frequency of extreme heat, fire weather and drought. “Australia is already experiencing climate change now and there are impacts being experienced or felt across many communities and across many sectors,” said Helen Cleugh, the director of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, which collaborated on the report. The study, which is updated every two years, found that Australia’s fire seasons have lengthened – in places by months – and become more severe. From April to October, there has been a broad shift to more arid conditions in south-eastern and south-western Australia. Sea levels have already risen by 20cm and ocean temperatures are up by 1C, which is causing acidification – 10 times faster than at any time in 300m years – which has damaged the corals of the Great Barrier Reef."

"Dramatic rises in atmospheric methane are threatening to derail plans to hold global temperature rises to 2C, scientists have warned. In a paper published this month by the American Geophysical Union, researchers say sharp rises in levels of methane – which is a powerful greenhouse gas – have strengthened over the past four years. Urgent action is now required to halt further increases in methane in the atmosphere, to avoid triggering enhanced global warming and temperature rises well beyond 2C.  “What we are now witnessing is extremely worrying,” said one of the paper’s lead authors, Professor Euan Nisbet of Royal Holloway, University of London. “It is particularly alarming because we are still not sure why atmospheric methane levels are rising across the planet.” Methane is produced by cattle, and also comes from decaying vegetation, fires, coal mines and natural gas plants. It is many times more potent as a cause of atmospheric warming than carbon dioxide (CO2). However, it breaks down much more quickly than CO2 and is found at much lower levels in the atmosphere. During much of the 20th century, levels of methane, mostly from fossil fuel sources, increased in the atmosphere but, by the beginning of the 21st century, it had stabilised, said Nisbet. “Then, to our surprise, levels starting rising in 2007. That increase began to accelerate after 2014 and fast growth has continued.” Studies suggest these increases are more likely to be mainly biological in origin. However, the exact cause remains unclear. Some researchers believe the spread of intense farming in Africa may be involved, in particular in tropical regions where conditions are becoming warmer and wetter because of climate change. Rising numbers of cattle – as well as wetter and warmer swamps – are producing more and more methane, it is argued. This idea is now being studied in detail by a consortium led by Nisbet, whose work is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council. This month the consortium completed a series of flights over Uganda and Zambia to collect samples of the air above these countries. “We have only just started analysing our data but have already found evidence that a great plume of methane now rises above the wetland swamps of Lake Bangweul in Zambia,” added Nisbet. However, other scientists warn that there could be a more sinister factor at work. Natural chemicals in the atmosphere – which help to break down methane – may be changing because of temperature rises, causing it to lose its ability to deal with the gas. Our world could therefore be losing its power to cleanse pollutants because it is heating up, a climate feedback in which warming allows more greenhouse gases to linger in the atmosphere and so trigger even more warming. In 2016, in Paris, nations agreed to cooperate to hold global temperature rises to 2C above preindustrial levels and, if possible, to keep that rise to under 1.5C. It was recognised that achieving this goal – mainly by curbing emissions of CO2 from fossil fuels – would always be difficult to achieve. Accelerating increases in a different greenhouse gas, methane, means that this task is going to be much, much harder. This point was backed by Martin Manning of Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. “Methane is the gas ... that keeps us to a 2C rise in global temperatures. And even more significantly, we do not really know why.” If nothing can be done about this, he added, then even more cuts will have to be made in CO2 emissions. Continued increases in methane levels will only make this situation worse, he said. This point was backed by Nisbet. “It was assumed, at the time of the Paris, agreement, that reducing the amount of methane in the atmosphere would be relatively easy and that the hard work would involve cutting CO2 emissions. “However, that does not look so simple any more. We don’t know exactly what is happening. “Perhaps emissions are growing or perhaps the problem is due to the fact that our atmosphere is losing its ability to break down methane. “Either way we are facing a very worrying problem. That is why it is so important that we unravel what is going on – as soon as possible.”"

"Harrison Ford has launched a scorching attack on Donald Trump and other world leaders, for denying science in order to justify doing nothing to face the “moral crisis” of climate change. The actor best known for fighting off Imperial stormtroopers as Han Solo and writhing in snake pits as Indiana Jones has now taken on the combined might of climate change deniers, with Trump a top target. Though Ford did not mention the US president by name, the subject of his speech at the final day of the World Government Summit in Dubai was beyond doubt. “Around the world,” he said, “elements of leadership including in my own country to preserve their state and the status quo, deny or denigrate science. They are on the wrong side of history.” Ford, at 76 four years Trump’s senior, has long been a campaigner for global environmental protection. He prefaced his speech at the summit with a short film, narrated in his trademark lion’s growl, featuring the character of Nature speaking about the future. “If I’m not kept healthy, humans won’t survive, simple as that,” Nature says. “I could give a damn with or without humans, I’m the ocean. I covered this entire planet once, and I can always cover it again.” Climate change denial and skepticism about established scientific truth have long been embraced by Trump. He has been propagating conspiracy theories about global warming since at least 2012, when he claimed it was a ruse by China to gain an unfair manufacturing advantage over the US. In June 2017 Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement to limit global pollution levels and control temperature rise. Last November he responded to a dire US climate assessment by 13 government agencies and top scientists with the blunt words: “I don’t believe it.” Only on Sunday, Trump issued yet another denigrating tweet in which he sought to mock the Democratic senator from Minnesota Amy Klobuchar, who had just launched a 2020 presidential bid, but ended up mocking climate science. He noted that Klobuchar had addressed global warming in her speech as snow fell around her. “Bad timing,” Trump said. In an interview with CNN before his Dubai appearance, Ford criticized directly the Trump administration for being “bent on dismantling all of the gains we’ve made in the protection of the environment”. He lamented the “isolationism, nationalism that’s creeping into governments all across the developed world. The problems require attention on nature’s scale not on the scale of the next election.” In his address to the summit, Ford called climate change “the greatest moral crisis of our time. We need nature now more than ever because nature doesn’t need people, people need nature.”"

"Hot in the footsteps of Art UK’s ambitious attempt to document every publicly owned artwork in Britain on a single website, a new online project has launched to repeat the project for the world’s watercolours – in particular those that, accidentally or on purpose, documented that world. Watercolour World is the brainchild of former diplomat Fred Hohler, whose first large-scale digitisation endeavour, the Public Catalogue Foundation, laid the groundwork for Art UK. The idea came to Hohler when he embarked on a tour of Britain’s public collections and realised quite how much there was to do on watercolour alone: Norwich Castle Museum held about 4,500 paintings by a single artist; the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, meanwhile, had somewhere between 200,000-300,000 watercolours in its drawers.   The value – and excitement – of the Watercolour World project, is that it views these historic paintings as documents, not aesthetic objects: visual records of the world at large, in colour, spanning a full 150 years before photography took over as our primary documentary medium. Between the invention of the spool camera around 1900 (which instantly superseded the pocket watercolour box as documentary tool of choice) and the advent of mass commercial colour photography in the 1950s, we lost, in a sense, half a century of colour. The website, which has launched with about 80,000 works, focuses on pre-1900 documentary paintings: archival information gathering often duly kept in binders and boxes ever since. Some of the artists on the site were professional painters. Others were military draughtsmen, official expedition watercolourists, botanists, surveyors, as well as the untold numbers of amateurs – which Hohler suspects will turn out to have mostly been women, unpaid for their time and skill – who picked up a paintbrush to record the world around them. The website has started with already digitised pieces from public collections: the Rijksmuseum, Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Musée des Beaux-Arts d’Orléans, to name some. Hohler is most excited, though, about what’s hiding in private archives, if only because most owners don’t even realise what they’ve got. “They all say the same thing,” he says: “‘Oh, we don’t have much.’” But often they do – hidden away in an attic or empty trunks in the living room. This unintentional neglect is why many of the works are in sterling condition: light and handling threaten both pigment and paper; forgetting about artworks doesn’t. While official draughtsmen used the best archival paper, amateurs worked on whatever they could find. Which lends an added incentive to the digitisation Hohler’s team is undertaking: many of these paintings have a shelf life, yet what they depict is potentially of vital importance. Hohler goes so far as to say that once the collection reaches the critical mass of 1m images, it will be an “absolutely indispensable tool to help us understand today”. From coastal erosion and ice-cap melt to loss of fauna and flora, not to mention direct human destruction (of Palmyra in Syria, say, by Islamic State, or the Seti tomb in Luxor, by tourists) these watercolours serve as an invaluable reference. Hohler cites the recently reported projected loss of a third of the Himalayan ice-fields. Most of the visual records we have of what those glaciers looked like 150 years ago is in watercolours. Among the images on the website is the first known, yet accidental, picture of Mount Everest, from the 1840s: it’s not even labelled Everest. A lot of the value in these images is similarly accidental. Often it’s the context – replete with treelines, snowlines or waterlines – the artist painted around, for example, the flower they’d set out to record. As Hohler puts it: “We have in this country all these images about, not this country, but the rest of the world – and they’re stuffed in drawers.” Beyond the UK, he has no idea quite how many images there are, worldwide, to be catalogued, but estimates it to be in the millions. The task is clearly not something his team will ever accomplish alone: the project is as much a call to arms as a public service. Anyone with a phone can send in a picture of a historical watercolour they might have lying about, to see if it’s worth cataloguing. And the more people do so, the more complete a picture of the bygone world this collection will provide. These watercolours, for the most part, even come with built-in metadata. The website retains the original caption information (even when it’s mistaken) as supplied by the collections the images come from. The team then tags them with appropriate search terms to help people find interesting stuff. And interesting stuff there is: from the French revolutionary knife grinder with his two canine assistants (search for “dogs”) to the students and their camel at a Marylebone boarding school (there are 366 images tagged with “camel”; search instead for “boarding school”). Teachers will have a field day. And, Hohler’s team suspects, so will any punter as curious about their own neck of the woods as they are about far-flung lands."

"Greta Thunberg is hopeful the student climate strike on Friday can bring about positive change, as young people in more and more countries join the protest movement she started last summer as a lone campaigner outside the Swedish parliament. The 16-year-old welcomed the huge mobilisation planned in the UK, which follows demonstrations by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. “I think it’s great that England is joining the school strike in a major way this week. There has been a number of real heroes on school strike, for instance in Scotland and Ireland, for some time now. Such as Holly Gillibrand and the ones in Cork with the epic sign saying ‘the emperor is naked’,” she told the Guardian. With an even bigger global mobilisation planned for 15 March, she feels the momentum is now building. “I think enough people have realised just how absurd the situation is. We are in the middle of the biggest crisis in human history and basically nothing is being done to prevent it. I think what we are seeing is the beginning of great changes and that is very hopeful,” she wrote. Thunberg has risen rapidly in prominence and influence. In December, she spoke at the United Nations climate conference, berating world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. Last month, she had similarly harsh words for the global business elite at Davos. She said: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” The movement she started has morphed and grown around the world , and, at times, linked up with older groups, including Extinction Rebellion, 350.org and Greenpeace. Next week she will take the train – having decided not to fly due to the high carbon emissions of aviation – to speak at an event alongside Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, in Brussels, and then on to Paris to join the school strikes now expanding in France. Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. “The movement that Greta launched is one of the most hopeful things in my 30 years of working on the climate question. It throws the generational challenge of global warming into its sharpest relief, and challenges adults to prove they are, actually, adults. So many thanks to all the young people who are stepping up,” said Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org. Around the world, so many student strikes are now taking place or planned that it is becoming hard to keep up. On Twitter, a supporter who posts under the name The Dormouse That Roared, has compiled a Google map that pins all the reported or announced locations, stretching from Abuja and Bugoloobi to Sacramento and Medellín. “This is not perfect by any means. It’s an emergency after all,” the online campaigner told the Guardian. The most recent version shows thick clusters of activity, particularly in the UK and northern Europe. “#climatestrike. The house is on fire. Just wow!” wrote @dormouseroared, who is also collecting the different terms for “climate strike” in different languages. In reply, people on Twitter have written, “I’ve been dreaming of this”, “Power to the children”, “beautiful” and simply “hope”. Australia was one of the first countries to mobilise. Last November, organisers estimate 15,000 students went on strike. Last Friday, students lobbied outside the offices of the opposition party. On 1 March, they will target the federal treasurer’s office. Two weeks later, they will join the global strike. They are demanding immediate political action to stop the Adani coalmine in Queensland, and a switch from fossil fuels to 100% renewable energy. On Thursday, three student activists from Castlemaine in Australia – Callum Bridgefoot, 11; Harriet O’Shea Carre, 14 and Milou Albrechy,14 – spoke with the leader of the opposition in the federal parliament. “It’s a good sign that he is willing to meet,” they said. “The prime minister condemned the strike.” The resources minister Matt Canavan was still more hostile, saying students would be better off learning about mining and science. “These are the type of things that excite young children and we should be great at it as a nation,” he told a local radio station. “The best thing you’ll learn about going to a protest is how to join the dole queue.” In Belgium, there have been strikes by thousands of students for at least four consecutive weeks, with one now-famous placard – addressed to politicians and policymakers – reading: “I’ll do my homework when you do yours.” More than 3,000 scientists have given their backing to the strikes. The Belgian government is clearly feeling the pressure. The environment minister was forced to resign after falsely claiming the country’s intelligence services held evidence that the striking children were being directed by unnamed powers. The allegation was quickly contradicted by intelligence chiefs. Switzerland has seen some of the biggest actions. Local activists said 23,000 joined the strike on 18 January, followed by 65,000 on 2 February. They too are preparing for the global demonstration on 15 March. They want the government to immediately declare a climate state of emergency, implement policies to be zero-carbon by 2030 without geo-engineering, and if necessary move away from the current economic system. Activists said they want to make clear that the problem is systematic rather than a matter of individual lifestyle choices. They have been criticised by right-wing politicians, but local governments have met student delegations to discuss short-term steps, such as a ban on any school trip that involves a flight. One regional authority has declared its support for the student movement. In an election year, state leaders have also expressed guarded support. “For the moment, the government has reacted in a very paternalistic way. They say that it’s a good sign that the youth is demonstrating for its future but they don’t really do anything about it,” said Thomas Bruchez, a 20-year-old student at the University of Geneva. In two weeks, he said the organisers will prepare for the next nationwide strike, when they will consider how to involve workers and try to define more precise claims, such as free public transport financed by highly progressive taxes. In Germany, activists told the Guardian there are mobilisations every week. Last Friday, there were 20,000 students striking in 50 cities. On 18 January, there were 30,000. And there will be another strike this Friday in at least 30 cities. The global strike on 15 March is expected to be the biggest yet with mobilisations in 150 cities. “It is not acceptable that grown-ups are destroying the future right now,” said Jakob Blasel, a high-school student. “Our goal to stop coal power in Germany and fossil energy everywhere.” He said politicians have expressed admiration for their campaign, but this has not translated into action. “This is not acceptable. We won’t stop until they start acting.” Until now 75% of the participants have been schoolchildren but increasing numbers of university students are joining. Luisa Neubauer, a 22-year-old, was among those invited to talk to senior cabinet officials. She told the German minister of economy that he was part of the problem because he was working for industry, rather than for people or the planet. “What we need our politicians and our government to understand is that everything they do today comes at a price for future generations,” she said. “We are not doing this for fun, but because we don’t have a choice.” But she too noted a new direction in the national discussion. “There is a debate now about climate and the environment, which is good. People for the first time in years are not talking about refugees but talking about the environment.” "
"Scientists have discovered a giant cavity at the bottom of a disintegrating glacier in Antarctica, sparking concerns that the ice sheet is melting more rapidly than expected. Researchers working as part of a Nasa-led study found the cavern, which they said was 300 metres tall and two-thirds the size of Manhattan, at the bottom of the massive Thwaites glacier.  The space is big enough to have contained 14bn tonnes of ice and most of that ice has melted during the past three years. In a paper published in Science Advances, the scientists said the rapid change in the ice was “unexpected” at some points on the glacier. The researchers found the cavity using Italian and German satellites and ice-penetrating radar from Nasa’s Operation IceBridge, which uses research aircraft to monitor changes in polar ice. “[The size of] a cavity under a glacier plays an important role in melting,” said the study’s lead author, Pietro Milillo, who is scientist at the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “As more heat and water get under the glacier, it melts faster.” But Milillo told the Guardian the size of the underwater cavity was not the main concern because the 14bn tonnes it released were already underwater and so would not contribute to sea level rise. The important aspect of the paper, he said, was what it revealed about the interaction between sea and ice. Jeremie Mouginot, a co-author of the paper and a research scientist at the Université Grenoble Alpes, said ocean water was filling a widening gap between the floating ice shelf and the bedrock. Thwaites, he said, was a 120km-wide “monster glacier” that is continuing its retreat with huge future implications, because it could potentially add 0.6 metres to rising seas. Thwaites also supports neighbouring glaciers that, if they melted, would increase sea levels by an additional 2.44 metres, threatening coastal communities worldwide. Mouginot said further studies would be needed on where and how Thwaites will decline. “The current question is not if the glaciers will retreat but at which pace.” There are already new investigations of Thwaites under way, including one by a UK team, as well as studies of other Antarctic regions. The hole is on the glacier’s western side and has been melting at a rate of about 0.6 to 0.8km a year since 1992, a rate that while stable was “extremely high”, Nasa said. Eric Rignot, a co-author of the study, said understanding how warming oceans were melting the glacier away was “essential to project its impact on sea level rise in the coming decades”. “We have suspected for years that Thwaites was not tightly attached to the bedrock beneath it,” he said."
"Such is the upside-down, topsy-turvy state of our world, that the children are now the adults and the adults are the children. In Westminster, our supposed leaders – men and women of mature vintage – keep stamping their feet and demanding what no one can give them. They insist they should be allowed to gobble up all the birthday cake and still have cake left to eat, threatening to storm out of the European Union and slam the door behind them. As Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, rightly puts it: “Threatening to leave is the behaviour of a three-year-old who says that they are going to hold their breath if they do not get the toy that they want.” In Washington, meanwhile, Donald Trump, aged 72 and three-quarters, has screamed and screamed and screamed until he is sick, pounding his little fist on the table as he demands money for the big wall of bricks he wants to build, and today declaring a national emergency to get his way. The House speaker, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, assessed the situation accurately last month, when Trump was shutting down the government: “It’s a temper tantrum by the president. I’m the mother of five, grandmother of nine. I know a temper tantrum when I see one.” But perhaps these comparisons are unfair – not to Trump or the Brexiters, but to children. Because while Trump has invented a wholly fake emergency – there is no threat of imminent invasion by migrants on the US’s southern border – and while the threat of a no-deal crashout from the EU is, if all too real, entirely avoidable via a simple vote of the House of Commons, it has fallen to children to point to the emergency that is neither fake nor easily averted. It has fallen to those so young they are not trusted to decide what they can eat or when they can go to bed to sound the alarm about the crisis that matters most: the crisis of the climate. What are we to make of today’s strike by schoolchildren, in Britain and across the world, part of a rapidly growing movement aiming for a global walkout of kids on 15 March? How should we react to a phenomenon that began with a single child, a Stockholm teenager by the name of Greta Thunberg, who skipped class one Friday last August to sit in protest on the steps of the Swedish parliament, and which today saw primary-aged children, as well as teenagers, following her lead, wielding placards as they marched in Parliament Square and the streets of dozens of British towns and cities? At first sight the reaction surely has to be one of unfettered joy. Many will share the enthusiasm of those veteran environmentalists hailing this as the most exciting, most hopeful development they have witnessed in decades of campaigning. A young generation so easily caricatured as disconnected and self-absorbed, heads tilted permanently downward towards their phones, Instagramming pictures of themselves, are instead taking a moral lead. Liberal parents have been beside themselves with pride, bundling up their little ones in scarves and gloves as they watch them bunk off school to save the planet. I suspect there will be many Guardian readers who shared the dilemma I myself faced this week. Not whether to allow their kids to miss lessons in an exam year for the higher cause of tackling climate change: that one was a no-brainer. No, the dilemma I have in mind is rather more finely balanced. Should the conscientious liberal parent reveal their excitement about seeing their son or daughter take a stand, or should they pretend to disapprove, thereby supplying their young with the thrill of principled rebellion? Teachers have grappled with the tension between the law, which says that children must be in school, and the obvious truth that this is a “teachable moment”, a learning experience. In fact, the law says children must be in school unless there are “exceptional circumstances”. As the country’s sole Green MP, Caroline Lucas, told me while marvelling at child protesters on the streets in her Brighton constituency: “When David Attenborough is warning that the future of civilisation is at risk, that counts as ‘exceptional circumstances’.”  It’s not just the case against carbon emissions that this moment can teach. Thunberg is also demonstrating the power of the individual act. It’s so easy to feel impotent given the sheer scale of the climate crisis. But Thunberg, whose Twitter bio describes her as a “16-year-old climate activist with Asperger”, is the living embodiment of the case against defeatism. Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg, an early and tireless environmental advocate, is right to say that the #FridaysForFuture movement is “not the first great change to begin with the action of just one person”: from Abraham onwards, our history and tradition is full of people who, alone at first, changed the world. All of these are reasons to be heartened. And yet, there is a harsher truth to face. These demonstrations by the young are a terrible indictment of the rest of us. They are a mark of our failure. Their action is only necessary because we have failed to act. As one placard at the Belgian protests told politicians: “I’ll do my homework when you do yours.” This week marked the first anniversary of the Parkland school shooting in Florida, a massacre of 17 that led to a mass movement of young Americans demanding gun control. That effort too is a product of failure, children having to act because adults have failed in their basic duty: to protect the young. There was great poignancy in Thunberg’s words to the UN climate change conference in Poland in December: “You are not mature enough to tell it like it is – even that burden you leave to us children.” Any delight, pride or joy we feel in these protests has to be tempered by the realisation of the adult world’s failure. There’s a last question, one that feels unfair given the idealism written on the faces of these children. Will this effort work? The sceptic will say not, speculating that the attention of the young is a fickle thing, that this will be – as parents have told their kids through the ages – just a phase. They might also add that the powerful are very skilled at co-opting, and thereby often neutralising, the young: witness Thunberg’s recent invitation to Davos. What’s more, polling suggests there’s not much in the way of heightened environmental consciousness among the young. According to Ipsos Mori, only 12% of 18- to 24-year-olds named the environment or pollution as an important, or the most important, issue facing the country – no higher or lower than the overall average. Ipsos Mori’s Ben Page reckons that until kids are blocking the roads in most towns, this latest effort “won’t cut through”. I’m more hopeful than that. There are signs that the climate crisis is finally getting the attention it deserves. Watch would-be Democratic challengers to Trump in 2020 fall over themselves to embrace the “green New Deal”, a vision of transforming the economy to save the planet with appeal beyond those who have previously tended to prioritise the environment. Watch too the way the Extinction Rebellion has captured the imagination; or the reaction to news that the world’s insect population is plummeting, a destruction that threatens the collapse of nature itself. Page warns that humans are exceptionally bad at spotting slow, long-term dangers: “We’re wired for sabre-toothed tigers,” he says. We can find it hard to envisage the future. The only way we can visualise it, perhaps, is through our children. When they tell us we are burning their future, as they are now, we have to overcome our shame at having failed them – and listen. • Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist"
"“The skies are brass and the plains are bare, Death and ruin are everywhere— And all that is left of the last year’s flood Is a sickly stream on the grey-black mud; The salt-springs bubble and the quagmires quiver, And this is the dirge of the Darling River.” — Henry Lawson (1891) The northern hemisphere faced a polar vortex, while Australia during December and January was the hottest on record. People and the environment are suffering at both ends of the planet because of the extreme events. Australia’s heatwave has exposed cracks in our unsustainable water, land-use and climate policies. Fish kills in the Darling River, followed by more in other waterways, are being blamed on drought. More than one million fish died following multiple events in December and January. The public has been aghast. The catalyst for outrage has been viral videos of hundreds of Murray cod floating dead and being displayed by angry locals. Murray cod is an icon of Australian waterways and one of the world’s largest species of freshwater fish. The biggest Murray cod – allegedly 114kg – was caught in 1902, during the federation drought in a tributary of the Darling, near Walgett. But extreme conditions and fish kills are natural here in the “land of drought and flooding rains”, right? The Darling is the longest river on the driest inhabited continent – prone to harsh and variable conditions. Lawson’s 1891 poem, which followed one year after the largest flood, is used often to depict the naturally occurring extreme conditions of our rivers. Indeed, European explorers who set off to chart flows to the “great inland sea” were surprised instead to discover a drought-stricken river – the Darling. Though the water was too salty to drink, it abounded with pelicans, swans, ducks and leaping fish. Heatwaves and drought have always occurred here but unsustainable levels of water extraction and climate change are much more recent. Vast quantities of water are now extracted and used, during drought and flood, to irrigate crops including rice and cotton. The amount of water used for irrigated agriculture varies, but ranged from about 50% of all flows in the Murray during the 1980s and 90s, to more than 76% during the Millennium Drought. Standards for healthy rivers are debated, but extraction of more than 20% of flows typically results in adverse changes to biodiversity and the benefits people derive from clean water. Worldwide the demand for fresh water is expected to increase by 55% by 2050. Australia is experiencing this water stress now. We are thus a canary, and the coalmine, for the rest of the world. Bottled water is now being trucked to Walgett where the largest Murray cod on record was swimming during the Federation Drought. The major rivers that join near Walgett are dry. Aboriginal elders say both rivers have not run dry in their lifetime. Large irrigated farms and harvesting of flood waters have been implicated in increasing water stress. About 150km north of Walgett lies Cubbie Station, and at 230,000 acres it is apparently the largest irrigated farm in the southern hemisphere. Cubbie Station doesn’t pump water from rivers that flow through Walgett, nor has it reported harvesting water since April 2017. Given that less than 2% of all water pumped from the Murray-Darling goes to household consumption it’s hard not to sympathise with those who argue that corporate irrigators have something to do with water stress. The flood waters harvested in recent years by irrigators could have been saved through water storage and wetlands to maintain dry-land agriculture and ecosystems during the current heatwave. Unlike the fish, people and small farms spread throughout the Murray-Darling – a few lobbyists and several hundred rice and cotton irrigators, occupying less than 1% of the land, profit from using about 40% of all water extracted. There is plenty of water to go around for people and the environment, but not enough to simultaneously sustain the current irrigation entitlements. Banning cotton and rice and degrading farmers will not solve the problem. What will solve it is reducing total water entitlements for irrigation and increasing flows for rivers and wetlands. Environmental flows have expanded in many regions, but the Darling and northern-basin still seem to be a wild west of water extraction. Minimum environmental flow standards have either not been in place or have been insufficient to sustain dry-land rivers. Minimum flow standards and policies around land use and run-off must be sufficiently robust to prevent further large-scale blue-green algae events, which are the proximate causes of the current hypoxia and fish kills. The best available science reviewed by the Wentworth Group of Concerned Scientists has recommend an increase in environmental flows, to a minimum of 3,200 GL per year to maintain healthy freshwater ecosystems. So, what can the world learn from our experience on the driest inhabited continent? Agriculture and water policies must be sufficiently robust to keep rivers flowing and communities supplied with clean water despite extreme conditions. With climate change, some lands that were once suitable for irrigated farming will not be viable in the future. The shift to sustainable water and land-use practices requires visionary long-term planning and generous funding for regional communities. Given the rising population density, housing and business costs in Melbourne and Sydney, maybe it’s time to revisit the Whitlam-era ideas of luring people and business outside the major cities? Subsidies that perpetuate the – hydro-illogical – cycle of unsustainable irrigation around the world should stop being funded. Instead, funding for communities must be targeted at helping farmers adapt and growing industries that will be viable during water scarcity, climate change and extreme conditions. Regional communities and freshwater ecosystems are much more than irrigation ditches and will thrive if presented with new opportunities. If global carbon emissions remain high, the 48.3C record temperature in Bourke, situated near the Darling River, a few weeks ago should be expected to become 50C or 51C by 2090. Temperatures in Death Valley are sometimes that hot, but then again no one is growing cotton or cod there. This does not have to be the dirge of the Darling, regional communities or farming. But it is time for change. R Keller Kopf is a freshwater ecologist at Charles Sturt University."
"When the parking lot in the bustling tourist zone of downtown Annapolis floods, the employees at Pip’s Dock Street Dogs restaurant take off their socks and shoes, wrap their legs in trash bags and wade out into the water. A lot of the time, it’s not even raining. High tides intensified by sea-level rise are just pushing the water inland, overwhelming the drainage system. Pip’s – named after owner Ryan Lamy’s daughter, whose real name is Madeline – floods inside frequently too. “We wait for the tide to go out, and then we mop,” Lamy said. “That’s all we can do.” Lamy has been running Pip’s for 10 years. His young daughter, pictured in photos on the walls of the restaurant, is now turning 15. And he says the flooding has only gotten worse, sometimes costing him thousands in lost sales each month. A new study attempts to quantify those losses, as coastal communities around the country brace for more tidal flooding as warmer temperatures increase sea levels. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Science Advances, the study estimates that eight shops in Annapolis saw about 3,000 fewer visitors and up to $172,000 less in revenue in 2017 when flooding closed the nearby parking lot. “We typically think about climate change in terms of extreme events like hurricanes and wildfires, but it actually causes impacts in all sorts of other ways,” said coauthor Miyuki Hino of Stanford University. “This is one way where it’s really a part of people’s daily lives. It’s chronic.”  Annapolis is seeing seas rise at about twice the global rate, and Hino said the flooding there foreshadows the problems other coastal communities can expect. “What we’re seeing on the east coast now is a preview of what we’re going to be seeing on the west coast in the future as the rate of sea-level rise continues to climb,” she said. One study showed seas rose up to five inches, an inch per year, in places between North Carolina and Florida from 2011 to 2015. Sea level rise threatens 300,000 US coastal homes. Higher elevation properties are becoming worth more in Miami, as people who can afford it move inland, according to research from Harvard. Globally, seas were three inches higher than the 1993 average by 2017, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they continue to rise one-eighth of an inch each year. An analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists finds that flood-prone areas in Annapolis, where the US Naval Academy is located, could be almost constantly under water by 2070. The roughly 50 floods a year could reach 400 floods a year by 2050. The so-called “nuisance flood” days have increased 925% in 50 years, according to the NOAA. The frequently flooded area in Annapolis is just a short walk from Maryland’s historic state capitol. A political cartoon that’s been tacked to the wall at Pip’s for years depicts city officials in a boat floating by the capitol. “I say it’s time to take action on possible city dock flooding!!” it reads. The city is planning to install pumps costing millions of dollars over the next few years. A few doors down, at the Annapolis Marine Art Gallery, visits have stalled when the parking lot has flooded, even though the water doesn’t come past the shop’s first step. Manager Nancy McPherson said the gallery has taken all of its low-hanging art down and driven it away four times for impending storms.  “I have tourists say all the time say ‘when will they raise the sea wall’? And I say it doesn’t come from there. It comes from a drain in the parking lot. When the tide’s high, where is it going to go? It comes out.” McPherson knows the flooding will only get worse, but she said the gallery hasn’t thought about relocating. “We’re just hoping the city can do something,” she said."
"After reading the news that cases of measles have soared by 50% in the last year, I recalled the first time I heard an anti-vaccination conspiracy theory. It wasn’t from a member of Donald Trump’s administration, or part of a frenetic, grammatically challenged Facebook post – it was from a classmate when I was at school. Her family wasn’t waging a crusade against medical science: they simply gave credence to disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield’s study that wrongly asserted a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Back then, the study had not yet been discredited. One only has to stray into anti-vaxxer internet forums for a few minutes to see that they’re stuffed with conspiracy theorists, opportunists, reactionaries, and – worst of all – hubristic idiots. This is the vanguard of the anti-vaxxer movement. But behind that vanguard are a lot of concerned parents who are being convinced of wild and dangerous ideas because we – and by we, I mean those of us who recognise the incontrovertible fact that vaccines are essential – aren’t talking to them properly. A number of the anti-vaxxer vanguard may have started life as concerned parents, but have gradually sunk into increasingly extreme positions because the only communication they’re getting from the other side is that they’re foolish and irresponsible. Almost every week the internet produces another diatribe against anti-vaxxers, or a listicle of their “horrifyingly stupid” social media posts.  A neat example of poor communication by those who are trying to stem anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories is a 2017 study called “Misinformation lingers in memory” by the University of Edinburgh, which found that using myth-busting techniques actually increased participants’ tendency to wrongly believe in a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. In other words, simply repeating a vaccination conspiracy theory and then debunking it with facts makes people more likely to believe the conspiracy theory than they did before, because reminding people of the conspiracy theory – even in order to discredit it – lodges it deeper in the public consciousness. This is not only the fault of the people hearing these arguments – it is our failure; it is a failure of communication. The Public Interest Research Centre , a communications organisation I sometimes work with, argues that miscommunications like these happen because we tend to think of human beings as fact-processing machines. We assume that if we make a factual argument loudly and often enough, people will eventually become overpowered by its inherent logic, believe it, and even start arguing it themselves. Most of the recent events in politics and society, including the finding that measles cases are increasing, should be evidence enough that this is assumption is entirely wrong, and that by leaning on it, we simply enlarge a gulf of understanding between us and the people we are trying to communicate with. Frustrated that they cannot see the world in the same way we do, we call them idiots and chancers, we denounce their beliefs – and then we wonder why they’re not coming around to our way of thinking. Over the past 30 years, during which free-market technocratic politics has been the dominant ideology, populations have been encouraged to believe that there is an agreed set of facts that we all must adhere to for the greater good, and that those who question these facts are a dangerous menace. But in the last five or 10 years, this ideology has begun to crumble, and as a result more and more people are beginning to question who is giving them facts and what their agenda might be. Following events such as the Iraq war and the financial crisis, which were so defined by greed and deception, some public scepticism is rational and maybe even welcome. But the anti-vaxxer movement has been given a shot in the arm, no pun intended, by this general collapse of trust in the establishment, which has been largely misunderstood, dismissed or even demonised by the traditional gatekeepers of public discourse. What began as scepticism about political ideals and ways of organising societies has spilled over into scientific disciplines where a shared agreement of the facts and reliance on empirical evidence is absolutely necessary. The anti-vaxxer movement is what happens when public scepticism is not fully understood or empathised with, and when defunct methods of experts shouting facts over and over again are the only response. The vacuum created by this lack of empathy is then filled by malicious actors who want to present themselves as the authority instead, and to erode trust in science to promote phenomena such as climate change denialism, or in a shared understanding of human rights in order to discriminate against others. This week, Darla Shine, the wife of the White House director of communications, went on a Twitter tirade  (something for which she has form – having previously used the platform to question why white people aren’t allowed to use the n-word, given its use by black people) against measles vaccines. People like Shine, and Trump, take advantage of the general atmosphere of disinformation in order to assert harmful and inaccurate arguments as universal truths. If we want to defeat the anti-vaxxer movement, we need to understand why it exists, and the increase in its popularity. We need to look at the wider context that allowed such a dangerous and obviously wrongheaded movement to flourish so unchecked. It might make us feel good to denounce anti-vaxxers as villains, but it doesn’t seem to be working. And as long as the attempts to stop anti-vaxxers fail, more and more children will be put at risk. • Ellie Mae O’Hagan is a freelance journalist writing mainly for the Guardian.
