"It’s easy to see why motor cars are such a popular form of transport: they’re private, comfortable and convenient. But the popularity of cars can also be one of their biggest drawbacks. When there are too many of them and not enough road space, streets become congested and as a result, journey times become unpredictable, air pollution increases and we lose out on some of the economic benefits of city living.  Now, a new study suggests that the personal benefits we get from having a car could be improved by collective thinking. Researchers at MIT and Birmingham University used big data from five cities – Rio de Janeiro, Boston, San Francisco, Lisbon and Porto – to show how strategic route changes by a relatively small number of motorists could reduce the time lost to congestion by as much as 30%.  The authors crunched massive amounts of mobile phone data to identify travel patterns during peak morning commuting times in each of these cities. They confirmed that the time lost due to congestion in each city reflects a high demand for road travel, relative to the supply of road infrastructure. They found that the density and distribution of the population played a role in congestion levels, too. No surprises here.  But by modelling this data, the authors were also able to measure the potential benefits of optimising the system as a whole. This is where it gets interesting. The researchers calculated the detrimental effects of “selfish routing” – where individuals set out to minimise their own travel time – by comparing this approach with the travel times resulting from a “socially optimal” solution.  They modelled a scenario where drivers were equipped with an app which gave them the option to take a longer route for the good of all. The authors found that overall, it only took a relatively small number of motorists to choose longer travel times, to create significant benefits for others. By giving drivers the option to take a socially optimal approach, rather than a “selfish” one, the total time lost to congestion could be reduced by between 15% and 30%.  One of the main problems with congestion is that it makes it difficult to accurately anticipate journey times. By giving drivers the option to pick their route with a predicted journey time, drivers who need to be at their destination at a particular time will know when to set out while drivers who are more flexible can avoid the worst congestion. It’s a “win-win” situation.  Even so, the actual time savings for individual motorists were found to be marginal – a few minutes at most. The authors of the study said that “in the best case scenario, time savings would be imperceptible for the majority of the drivers”. Rather, the optimised routing would help cities to function better as a whole.  This offers a crucial insight for urban leaders looking to grow their city’s wealth and population. The research demonstrates that there’s limited scope for road-based solutions to the issues arising from urban congestion. Routine commutes to and from work make it difficult for drivers to be flexible, even if there were some incentive to take a longer, more socially beneficial route. The authors’ proposal may work better on the road networks between cities, where trips are longer and fewer drivers are inflexible when it comes to timing.  Ultimately, city authorities should recognise that offering alternative modes of transport will do a lot more to reduce congestion than giving motorists the option to be socially responsible drivers. For instance, rail in its various forms provides speedy and reliable travel for daily commuters, as well as tackling all the economic and environmental issues caused by congestion."
"Australia’s carbon emissions would be more than 200m tonnes lower and electricity prices would be cheaper if the Greens had supported the carbon pollution reduction scheme a decade ago, the Labor frontbencher Pat Conroy says. Speaking on the 10th anniversary of the 2009 parliamentary defeat of Labor’s emissions trading system, Conroy has lashed the political failure to develop a national energy policy as “perhaps the most consequential policy failure of the modern era in Australia”. While taking aim at interest groups on “both sides” for the impasse over national energy policy, Conroy said the Greens’ decision to side with the Liberal and National parties to defeat Labor’s CPRS in the Senate in 2009 was a “massive error of political judgment” with far-reaching consequences. “The Coalition and the Greens bear a heavy responsibility for the fact that, a decade later, Australia still does not have an effective policy to tackle climate change by reducing emissions,” Conroy, the shadow minister assisting for climate change, will say in a speech at the Australian National University in Canberra on Monday. “It has had disastrous and long-lasting consequences for Australia’s ability to respond effectively to climate change.” “The costs of this failure are being born by Australian households and businesses facing higher prices, risks to the reliability of energy supplies and missed economic opportunities (and) these costs will only grow into the future.” Conroy says that had the CPRS been implemented, emissions for 2020 would have been reduced to 459m tonnes compared to the 540m tonnes projected by the department, which are on track to keep rising to 563m tonnes by 2030. “That is 81m tonnes lower than now projected, or more than all of the fugitive emissions from the Australian coalmining and oil and gas production industries combined,” Conroy says of the 2020 figure. “That means that by voting to defeat the CPRS, the Greens voted against cumulative additional emissions reductions of 218m tonnes between 2010 and 2020 – emissions reductions which would have come on top of the actual outcomes we have seen over the last decade in Australia. “And by voting against the CPRS, the Greens also voted against a mechanism putting Australia’s emissions on a downward trajectory beyond 2020.” Conroy further argues that environmental groups should also take responsibility for Australia’s climate policy impasse, saying green groups had made “perfect the enemy of the good” in opposing the CPRS. “As a result, Australia is still in the midst of a ‘climate war’ with no real climate policy and has higher emissions today than under a scenario in which the CPRS was implemented.” Conceding that Labor had also made mistakes in its handling of the vexed issue of climate policy, Conroy said the party should have gone to a double dissolution election in 2010 after the defeat of the CPRS. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He also pointed to shortcomings in the election campaign this year, saying the party failed “to win the confidence of the voters” for its climate policy, which became the subject of a Coalition scare campaign targeting coal seats in Queensland. “Climate and energy policy were not everything in our election loss, but the way the issue was framed by our political opponents, certainly did cost us electoral support in parts of the country,” Conroy says. Labor is reviewing all of its policies following the election defeat, but Conroy said the party remained committed to action on climate change. “In the current parliamentary term Labor will review its policies in the light of developments in energy markets and in the wider economy, and international efforts to tackle climate change. “A basic lesson from the last several years is that you can have a first-best policy solution, but unless you earn the confidence of the public you will never be in a position to implement it.” But Conroy also called on the Greens and activist groups to reflect on their campaign activities, arguing that progressive forces were also to blame for the political stalemate over climate policy, along with “climate deniers, right-wing ideologues and vested interests who act as a cheer squad for delay and inaction”. “The Greens are a party which seeks to increase its electoral support from progressive voters by attacking Labor on climate change,” Conroy says. “(And) in this year’s election campaign, some environmental organisations preferred to pressure Labor to commit to closing down the coalmining industry rather than focusing on the Coalition’s inadequate policies.” Conroy said the anti-Adani convoy was a good example of an “opportunistic tactic” aimed at boosting the Greens’ Senate vote, but one which also helped the Coalition hang on to marginal seats in central Queensland. “The question for the Greens is whether they place a higher priority on winning votes at Labor’s expense than on supporting action to reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions.” The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has defended the Adani convoy, accusing Labor of wanting to retreat on climate change policy because of the election result. Di Natale also defended the party’s climate record, saying the party supported Julia Gillard in 2010 to introduce world leading climate legislation that reduced emissions. He said the legislation “was internationally lauded as template legislation until Labor infighting allowed the climate denialists in the Abbott government to scrap it.” “Prior to the last election, the Greens reached out several times to Labor in the hope of working together on climate policy but they weren’t interested,” he said. “We’ll continue to try and work with Anthony Albanese to get a climate policy that reflects the science but we remain concerned that Labor is preparing the ground to weaken their policy at a time when we need stronger and more urgent action.” On Sunday, Labor’s leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, said the 10 years since the CPRS defeat had reinforced her view “that we have to find common ground” to act on climate change. “The thing that is quite clear is that neither the Coalition nor the Greens political party have learnt the lessons of the last decade,” Wong told the ABC’s Insiders. “The Coalition is still in denial, and division, and the Greens political party have to decide – are they actually prepared to look for change, to look for common ground, to act for change? Or are they really going to make it their political objective to take votes off the Labor party and have a political fight with the Labor party?”"
"In September 2016, 4,350 Paralympic athletes will arrive in Rio de Janeiro to compete for medals across 23 different sports. The games in Rio have a lot to live up to. London’s 2012 Paralympics proved to be a magnet for sponsorship, and competitors have said that the crowds – and their enthusiasm – were unparalleled. But there’s another respect in which the 2012 games set the standard for future Paralympic tournaments: it made the host city itself more accessible.  In order to secure their bid for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games, organisers had to make two key promises to do with transport. One was to make public transport a key part of their sustainability agenda. The other was to make London 2012 more accessible than any previous games. London 2012 was planned as a public transport-driven games, and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) took action to maximise its usage. To live up to their promises, the committee had to overcome a number of challenges. Parts of London’s transport system had to undergo a radical overhaul. The commitments also had major implications for venue design, equipment and even the workforce of the games. And because the idea of “legacy” was central to all of the preparations for the games, the solutions put in place needed to work over the long term – not just the main event.  When LOCOG started its work, disabled people’s confidence in using the public transport network was very low, so there was a need to change people’s perceptions through advertising. The demand from disabled people to attend the Paralympics was higher than expected, but organisers did not know what sort of mix of disabled spectators they needed to plan for. For example, while they knew that many groups of wheelchair users would be arriving, they did not know how many would be using electric wheelchairs, manual wheelchairs or scooters – each of which has different requirements for travel.  Finally, the transport system needed to be flexible enough to accommodate the extra short-term influx and diverse needs of disabled people, and revert back to more “standard” operations after the event. For a transport system first developed in the mid-1800s, these were no small demands.  The London Underground – commonly known as “the tube” – was the first underground rail network in the world. At some points, the tracks are almost 60m below ground. Modernising such a system involves working around complex arrangements of existing infrastructure. For example, adding a two-lift shaft to Green Park station in central London in time for the games required engineers to build a straight path between pedestrian tunnels, escalators, stairwells and the platforms themselves – not to mention finding the least disruptive times to carry out the developments and space to store the construction equipment.  Such logistics meant that it was impossible for LOCOG to create new accessible entrances into all of the stations. Nevertheless, the organising committee worked with Transport for London, the city’s transport authority, to adapt the public transport system and improve accessibility.  Evidence such as wheelchair ticket sales, pre-booked journeys and increased lift usage suggests that many more people with disabilities were using public transport throughout the games. Tactile paving and protective walls at the platform edges made the system safer for the visually impaired. And 66 of London’s 270 functioning tube stations were fitted with step-free access, while the overground DLR system was fully accessible.  In many stations – particularly on the Piccadilly line – the issue was the height difference or the gap between the platform and the carriage floor. Changing the position of the platforms would have been disruptive and costly. So instead, platform ramps were installed across four stops on the Piccadilly line, while manual ramps were provided at 16 strategic stations, to make it easier for wheelchair users to get on and off the train.  These ramps not only benefited disabled people but could be used by the wider community, including parents with pushchairs and tourists with suitcases. They were left in place after the games as part of LOCOG’s legacy commitment. And since then, they have been added to 28 more stations.  Of course, there’s still much to be done before London can be a truly accessible city – a fact highlighted by Paralympian Hannah Cockroft, who challenged London Mayor Boris Johnson to spend a day navigating the tube in a wheelchair (he declined). And there are concerns that the momentum toward further improvements is waning.  But London 2012 still marked a major leap forward in disabled access to public transport. Through a combination of controlled traffic management, communication with Londoners and collaboration with industry partners, LOCOG was able to develop practical and efficient transport solutions. These did more than fulfil the transport requirements for the Olympic and Paralympic Games: they also left a legacy value for Londoners to enjoy, and set a new standard in games-time transport.  Now, Rio is taking the challenge to heart, by launching projects to improve accessibility in the city ahead of the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Indeed, British experts have been actively involved in helping to transfer the learning from London 2012 to improve accessibility for Rio 2016. Rio has a golden opportunity to seize this legacy opportunity and set even better standards. Let the games begin. This article is part of a series on the outlook for Rio 2016.

"Coffee is the drink of choice for millions of us. But the world’s second-most traded commodity originates in Ethiopia – and its home is under threat. Ethiopia isn’t all dusty deserts – far from it. The country also contains rugged highlands and lush, tropical forests. Coffea arabica grows here in its original, wild form. The forests of south-west Ethiopia are considered to be the birthplace of coffee and the centre of its genetic diversity.  But these forests and this gene pool are under pressure. It is already one of the last major woodlands remaining in Ethiopia, and deforestation over the past 40 years has resulted in the loss of one-third of the south-west’s forest cover. We risk losing the forests entirely in coming decades. It is critical that these forests are protected. Commercially grown coffee has been bred over the years to ensure high yields and other useful characteristics. But it is descended from a small number of individual plants, and so relies on a relatively narrow genetic range – just 10% of the diversity found in the wild. This makes it vulnerable to pests – and climate change is an additional threat.  Wild coffee on the other hand exhibits much greater genetic diversity, which increases its chances of adapting to new challenges and reduces the possibility of extinction. It represents an insurance policy for plantation coffee, in case commercial strains are ever badly damaged.  These forests also play a critical role as a “water tower” for the river Nile – serving lowland Ethiopia, South Sudan and Egypt, storing carbon to stabilise the climate and enhancing rainfall upwind in the often drought-affected, northern highlands of Ethiopia. But maintaining these forests is difficult. Rainfall in the south-west is good and the soil fertile and there is a long history of people moving here for farming, including from the drier and more densely settled north of the country. This, alongside investor interest in commercial coffee and tea plantations, has seen agricultural land encroach on the forest. Without adequate resources to police such a large area, the forest became “open access” – anyone could go in and take what they wanted and they rarely got apprehended. In an effort to protect the country’s forest resources, the Ethiopian government adopted a nationwide policy of Participatory Forest Management (PFM), which bestows management responsibilities on communities that live near the forest and have had traditional rights to it. Communities elect “forest management groups”, which include women, to administer their bit of forest for which they have secured tenured rights from the government. This helps them control access to the forest and stop deforestation. In return for the secure tenure and usage rights, the community has to ensure that the natural forest is maintained, which they do through regular monitoring. This all takes time – a precious resource if you are a subsistence farmer. Rights to use coffee, honey, spices and other forest products provides an additional livelihood for people and compensation for looking after the forest. By making the forest pay it becomes a competitive land use, better able to compete with agriculture and motivating people to protect it and its valuable resources. Over the past six years, the Wild Coffee Conservation Project has worked with 55 forest management groups to secure more than 60,000 hectares of forest under these PFM agreements. Results to date look promising – deforestation in the project area has been reduced to a twelfth of that in non-project areas. Furthermore, cooperatives set up to market forest products collected by locals have succeeded in producing a high-quality coffee from the wild strands in the forest. This has sold on the international market for the highest price ever for Ethiopian sun-dried coffee – three times the average non-wild price.  This is encouraging, but the project and communities need to do more to get a competitive edge over agriculture. We need carbon and other ecosystem payments (payment to landowners in exchange for managing their land in a way that conserves natural resouces), all of which help with the maintenance of biodiversity. And we need to develop market links for forest spices and honey. Securing the future of wild coffee and the forests it lives in needs local people to maintain and use these forests, to earn a living from them so they can afford to protect them in the long term and want to do so. Such a system is sustainable – unlike many of the protectionist approaches such as Biosphere Reserves which rely on fluctuating government funds and which exclude people from the forest. Forest people are the solution to this problem: we need to give them the responsibility for the forest, so that they can save it – and the wild coffee gene pool within it – if we want to continue to enjoy our lattes and cappuccinos in the future.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA few days ago the online Washington Post here had an excellent feature story by Peter Whorisky on the long-held belief that food products rich in saturated fats, like whole milk, were a risk to human health. It turns out that this decades-long belief, once backed by a “overwhelming consensus” among scientists, is now appearing to have been mortally wrong.
Science lied, people died
Unfortunately it took the science decades to realize it and government agencies responsible for issuing dietary guidelines still aren’t yet prepared to move to revamp the dietary guidelines as necessary. Meanwhile tens of millions worldwide have died prematurely of protracted, horrible deaths stemming from them following the faulty nutritional guidelines.
Five decades long nutritional scientists, every medical institution, among them the American Heart Association and the Academy of Sciences, all touted the high carb, low-fat diet. And five decades long they were wrong. It took a global epidemic of diabetes and heart disease to get the message across. And finally the media are catching up – though grudgingly: Whorisky pretty much keeps the focus on whole milk only, and away from meat, eggs and other healthy foods we have been told not to eat.
The WaPo writes:
Scientists who tallied diet and health records for several thousand patients over ten years found, for example, that contrary to the government advice, people who consumed more milk fat had lower incidence of heart disease.”
Why the focus only on milk? Why not on meat, eggs, bacon and other sources rich in animal fat? If your are going to admit you were wrong, then do it slowly and hope it doesn’t blow up.
The new medical and nutritional findings are not only a huge embarrassment for the government and medical institutions, but may also be a huge dilemma for the media’s much beloved environmental movement, which long has been touting granola-munching diets as a sustainable way to nourish humans. A renewed shift to animal products is not exactly the direction the planet-saving vegans and environmentalists want us to be on.
According to Marcia Otto, assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Texas:
 What we have learned over the last decade is that certain foods that are high in fat seem to be beneficial.”
Whorisky writes that government bureaucrats are now unsure about how to proceed with revising its dietary recommendations. Suddenly and profoundly changing the long-held guidelines likely is not going to go over well with a public that already distrusts government and could even possibly open the government to lawsuits. At any rate it would be a major blow to credibility.

An interesting aspect of Whorisky’s piece is that the media and governments make it sound like all of this is new stuff. It is not. Decades-long a poorly funded minority of experts insisted that the nutritional science behind the lipid hypothesis had been weak and even faulty, and should never be made into dietary guidelines. But these skeptics were defunded, ridiculed and silenced; their science never saw the light of day. It turns out these skeptics had been right all along.
“Fragile hypothesis” becomes “treatment dogma”
Whorisky brings up the 7-country chart by Ancel Keys, regarded as the scientific foundation of the high-carb/low-fat theory, and makes it sound as if the chart originally was valid and that data from other countries came later on. That was not the case. The truth is that Keys had all the data from the other countries from the get-go but chose not to plot them because doing so would have shown that his beloved fat-theory was rubbish – there was in fact no trend showing that heart disease was related to fat intake. Keyes intentionally cherry-picked, cheated and deceived the public by using only the data points that produced a hockey stick.
From then on his theory morphed into a dogma that would go on to survive almost 6 decades. Unfortunately millions of people would die prematurely because of the guidelines later adopted as a result.
Whorisky writes:
‘The vibrant certainty of scientists claiming to be authorities on these matters is disturbing,’ George V. Mann, a biochemist at Vanderbilt’s medical school wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine. Ambitious scientists and food companies, he said, had “transformed [a] fragile hypothesis into treatment dogma.”
Indeed, the subsequent 40 years of science have proven that, if nothing else, the warning against saturated fats was simplistic.
Although Whorisky tunneled his focus on milk and did not accurately present the work of Ancel Keys and the dissidents who opposed him, his piece is one that was overdue and it represents a major step in getting the government and medical associations to admit that they screwed up massively. In hindsight the affair is turning out to be nutritional malpractice of the most egregious sort.
Incredibly, perhaps with the aim of protecting the interests of its many member cardiologists and other physicians, the American Heart Association still stands behind the junk-science based lipid hypothesis and continues to deny the fact that fat is vital for human health and that refined carbohydrates have been the true American dietary disaster.
Climate science is even worse than “fat” science
The same type of junk science is now occurring with a carbon of another form: atmospheric CO2. Here a new breed of junk scientists are hysterically maintaining that CO2 will cause the earth’s climate system to have a heart attack. Here the science backing up that theory is even worse than that of Ancel Keys.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Suppression of Natural Cycles Research by Universities – Is It To Protect Grant Money? 
By David Dilley
Former NOAA meteorologist,
(Now CEO of www.globalweatheroscillations.com)
On August 26, 2015, NoTricksZone published the article: “Gross Suppression of Science…Former NOAA Meteorologist Says Employees Not to Talk About Natural Cycles” where in it I wrote how the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned employees not to put forth alternative views on climate science.
Also in the article I described an incident in which the University of Maine was instrumental in canceling my scheduled Climate Change lecture – simply because they felt “some people in the audience may feel uncomfortable” hearing about natural cycles.
Some readers were aghast by this article and reluctant to believe that a university could be so bold to actually shut down a guest lecture at another institution, and thus infringe on the open academic exchange of ideas, which is so vital for the progress of science. But whenever articles are based on real observations and facts, more meteorologists and climate researchers come forward and share related information and experiences.
Dr. William Gray, Colorado State University
Was the shutting down of my Natural Climate Cycle lecture by the University of Maine an isolated incident or was it a common tactic used to avoid retaliation by the funding sources and thus ensure the flow of future grants? To shed light on this Dr. William Gray, Emeritus Professor of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University (CSU) and head of the Tropical Meteorology Project, provided his insights to me in a recent conversation. Dr. Gray recalled how he and Dr. Fred Singer “had experienced a somewhat similar situation with a scheduled climate talk at the University of Colorado, a university that receives generous amounts of grants for studies on anthropogenic climate change.”
Just as was the case with my scheduled lecture at the University of Maine, his lecture too had been advertised and a room assigned. But then, just prior to the lecture, Dr. Gray was informed that the room was “no longer available”. Dr. Gray asked for another room – and requested the room to be unlocked 30 minutes prior to the lecture so they could set up and that the university provide video equipment. They seemingly accommodated his requests. But upon arriving at the room a half hour prior to the lecture, he found that it was much smaller than the other room and that it was locked. They waited and waited, then finally at the very minute the lecture was scheduled to begin, the university unlocked the door. No video equipment was available. Was my lecture and Dr. Gray’s both shut down by the universities in order to protect the flow of grants? Is this now becoming common practice to suppress the freedom of speech, the open exchange of ideas and the science of natural climate change cycles?

Fritz Vahrenholt, University of Osnabrück
The same type of academic suppression also happened involving S. Fred Singer and Prof. Claes Johnson at an engineering and scientific society in Belgium (in this particular case the suppression stemming from a high level IPCC official) and with German professor Fritz Vahrenholt at the University of Osnabrück, just after the release of his climate science skeptical book “Die kalte Sonne”. The list is surely a long one, and many other professors and speakers can confirm the practice, or even far worse, with their own experiences.
Selling Integrity In Exchange For Grant Money? 
In 2008 I had a very candid conversation with Dr. Reid Bryson, who passed away in 2009 and is considered the “Father of Climatology”, and just this past week with Dr. Gray. Both professors put forth similar information on the acquisition of grants and both indicated this is how all university programs work. They told me, “Most university research departments rely heavily on government and private grants to survive.” According to Dr. Gray university research departments must play ball and “play by the rules” instituted by the grant system in order to secure climate grants. Playing by the rules means grant money for anthropogenic climate change is fairly easy to acquire, and all you have to do is apply for the advertised grant and deliver what the grant is requesting – which is to tie your research to human induced global warming.
Both Drs. Gray and Bryson indicated that “almost no grant money” is available for non-anthropogenic climate research. They also went on to say: “If you are a tenured professor, you must play by the rules and get published in journals to survive in the department. If you are not tenured, you definitely must play by the anthropogenic grant rules, or else tenure is a dream that will never be met”.
This is how the young researchers are kept in line by universities, and essentially sell their integrity in exchange for anthropogenic global warming grants. As a result of this biased grant system, there is very little research on natural cycles coming out of the universities. Most natural cycle research is either now being conducted by private companies that are not tied to the grant system, or by retired researchers who no longer need to worry about playing the game. So yes, the manipulation by the Universities of Maine and Colorado, and elsewhere, to shut down research and discussion lectures on natural climate cycles are not an uncommon practice and are aimed at protecting and maintaining the inflow of anthropogenic grants and agendas.
======================
Note: Not only is suppression of science a problem at the academic level, but there’s strong evidence of this at scientific institutions such as the NOAA. Anyone with more information regarding an NOAA “Talking Points” memo of the late 1990s instructing employees not to promote alternative views on climate science, please contact Mr. Dilley dilley@globalweatheroscillations.com. More on this later.

Share this...FacebookTwitterClimate change on Mars – is it analogous to that on Earth?
By Dr. Dietrich E. Koelle
 [Translated/edited by P Gosselin]

Fig. 1: Structure of the Milky Way (Wikipedia, NASA/JPL-Caltech/R. Hurt)
Drawing conclusions on the development of the Earth’s climate from climate change on Mars would be quite difficult because there is no concrete data from Mars. But it is considerably easier to do this in the opposite direction: The large climate changes on Earth that occurred  cyclically about every 150 million years are traced back to a long-term fluctuation in cosmic ray intensity, or simply the radiation variation as to the various cosmic dust density conditions as the solar system traveled through the spiral arms of our Milky Way galaxy.
It is known that the solar system orbits about the center of the Milky Way every 220 million to 240 million years at a distance of 25,000 to 28,000 light years from the center. The Milky Way’s diameter is roughly 100,000 light years.
These radiation intensity fluctuations repeatedly led to global mean temperature extremes here on Earth that ranged from 0°C (Snowball Earth) to 28°C, which saw palm trees in Antarctica (see Fig. 2).
Earth is currently in the middle of an ice age

Approximately 2.5 million years ago a new large ice age began. It is one that we are not really aware of because we happen to find ourselves in one of the 10,000-year relatively warm but brief interglacial periods, which we call the Holocene.
These roughly 10,000-year interglacials have been occurring about every 100,000 years over the past million years.If these extreme temperature fluctuations occurred due to changes in radiation intensity, then they also had to occur on the other planets of our solar system, for example on Mars.As was the case on Earth, this means that considerably higher temperatures would necessarily been the case there 100 million years ago (also 270 million years ago). These warm conditions would have permitted liquid water to exist on the planet’s surface.
Recently traces of such water have been detected on multiple occasions by NASA.

Melting has stopped in the Arctic
In the Arctic sea ice extent has indeed on average dropped a million square kilometers. But a look at the plotted sea ice anomaly data we see that sea ice has in fact stabilized over the past 11 years. And when one looks at the past 5 years, we see a rising trend.

Arctic sea ice anomaly (click chart to enlarge): Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/arctic.png
Today the Arctic sea ice anomaly is some 742,000 square kilometers below the satellite mean. This is well within the range of natural variability. The truth is that over the past 10 years Arctic sea ice anomaly was below the 2 million sq. km. negative deviation only for a few weeks, and these events were mostly weather related.
Antarctica solidly above normal last 20 years
For global warming alarmists, Antarctica has been the huge inconvenience. A look at the plotted data over the past 20 years tells us that the mean Antarctic sea ice has been solidly above the long-term mean:

Two points are of great interest in Antarctica: 1) Sea ice recently stayed above normal for a period of more than 3 years, from 2012 to 2015. This is something that had never happened before during the satellite period. 2) The sea ice (long-term) trend in Antarctica over the past 30 years has undisputedly been one of steady rise. This has shocked a number of now very baffled climate scientists.
Overall total global sea ice has been rising robustly over the past four years. To say that global sea ice melting has accelerated over the past years is totally false. The opposite is true, as the following chart shows:

Global sea ice in fact has been at normal levels over the past three years. This is good news that obviously has yet to be communicated to the climate catastrophe-obsessed conference-goers in Paris.

"Former US secretary of state and Democratic senator John Kerry has launched a new coalition of powerbrokers, including top politicians, military leaders, and Hollywood celebrities, to fight for addressing the climate crisis.  This coalition – named World War Zero, in reference to the national security danger presented by global heating – aims to convince people that rapid mobilization is required to halt the increase in carbon emissions within 30 years. According to United Nations scientists, global carbon emissions must be halved by 2030 – and eliminated completely by 2050 – to restrict warming to comparatively safe levels. The US and China are the top polluters in the world. While other countries are working to bolster the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate, Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from the pact. The bipartisan bloc includes Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, as well as moderate Republicans such as former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the New York Times reported. Celebrities such as Sting, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ashton Kutcher are also among the some 60 original members, the newspaper said. Participants might favor particular policy approaches to cutting emissions – such as a carbon dioxide tax or federal environmental programs – but the group is not touting any specific initiative. During a Sunday morning appearance on NBC’s Meet The Press, host Chuck Todd asked Kerry whether the real issue was getting Trump to act on climate – rather than raising awareness. “Well it’s not just the president, Chuck. There are great efforts out there, many environmental groups, young people, particularly, but no country is getting the job done,” Kerry said. “I mean, the simple reality is that we are way behind, way behind the 8-ball. Things are getting worse, not better. And so we have our unlikely allies coming together here.” “There’s no group that has people as diverse as ours in terms of nationality, age, gender, ideology, background, life experience and all of these people have come together saying, we’ve got to treat this like a war,” Kerry continued. “But with the desire to make certain that in America and around the world, people are going to put this issue way up at the top of the list. We’re going to do the things we need to do, we’re going to organize, we’re going to mobilize, we’re going to talk to literally millions of Americans over the course of the next months, and this is going to become a primary issue.” WATCH: Talking about the climate coalition World War Zero, Fmr. Sec of State @JohnKerry says ""we are way behind the eight ball"" on combating climate change #MTP #IfItsSunday""Things are getting worse, not better. And so we have our unlikely allies coming together here."" pic.twitter.com/xlI45r2Ngi Schwarzenegger said environmental advocates had to communicate more effectively – by discussing pollution, not global heating. Polling conducted by The Schwarzenegger Institute, which aims to impact public policy in a post-partisan manner, indicated the words “climate change” didn’t have all that much impact with Americans. “I think the way to convince the whole world is by not just always talking about climate change, which doesn’t mean that much to most of the people,” he said on Meet The Press. “When we said, ‘climate change,’ [to] the conservatives, there were only 17% interested and thought that there was a serious threat. But as soon as we said pollution, the numbers went over 50%.” “So, we got to communicate. The environmental community has to communicate better and talk about pollution, because pollution is a threat right now.” In Schwarzenegger’s view, people aren’t likely to think of threats decades in the future – impacting how the conversation should be framed. “They think about now. How can I survive? How can I provide jobs? How can I go and feed my family?” he said. “Those are the kind of issues and that’s why it’s important that we talk about the health issue.”"
"It’s fair to say that frozen food has a bit of an image problem. One in three Britons believe it is inferior to fresh food, and 43% say that nothing could persuade them to buy more frozen fare. Confidence in the sector was further knocked by the infamous horsemeat scandal.  But for the sake of our health, our pockets and the environment, it may be time to stop turning our noses up at frozen food. Humans have been using freezing as a means of safely preserving food for thousands of years. But it wasn’t until the 1920s, when Clarence Birdseye kick-started the development of home refrigerators and launched the first line of frozen foods, that the industry really took off.   Despite embracing other types of convenience foods and the rise of ready meals – with the market predicted to grow 20% by 2017 – the UK is still reluctant to go frozen. Instead frozen food is often viewed as a last resort – for when people can’t get to the shops. Some of it may come down to snobbery. According to the director general of the British Frozen Food Federation, frozen food compares favourably to fresh in blind taste tests. But in the UK and US there is a passionate love-hate relationship with frozen food retailers such as Iceland.  Despite the growth of budget brands Aldi and Lidl in recent years, Iceland is still perceived in some circles as being downmarket and inferior, something it is challenging with its new “power of frozen” marketing strategy. Ironically perhaps, this is in part due to price. Frozen foods are often cheaper at point of sale than fresh produce – due to lower production costs – and this can affect consumers’ perception of quality. Similar beliefs are held in the US, where in one study; four out of five consumers believed frozen foods to be “highly processed”. Not so in France. Many French consumers see frozen food as being healthy, fresh, and of a high quality. This is no doubt helped by the strong brand presence of Picard, a premium retailer, which accounts for a fifth of all new frozen food launches in the country.  And who are we to argue with the French, whose reputation for fine food is in stark contrast to international beliefs about British food?  It does seem that the French might be on to something. Studies have shown that freezing does indeed “lock in” the beneficial nutrients of fruits and vegetables.  In one experiment, fresh produce was stored in a general household fridge at 4°C for up to three days. They were then compared with equivalent frozen produce stored in a domestic freezer at -20°C. The concentrations of antioxidants and other key nutritional components decreased in the refrigerated produce, and ended up lower than that found in the frozen goods.  Freezing excess food can also help us with portion control – which is thought to be key to tackling the current obesity epidemic. Frozen fruit and veg also count towards your five a day so the health argument for having a stock of non-perishable fruit and veg is pretty clear. Britain has the highest level of food wastage in the European Union, with each household throwing away 13lb (6kg) of food each week. Throwing away items that could have been consumed cost each household £470 (US$679) in 2012. Embracing frozen food would likely lead to a reduction in food waste and create a more sustainable use of seasonal foods that are consumed out of season, as well as saving us money.  Of course, freezing isn’t appropriate for all foods. The process of freezing creates ice crystals. The more water there is in a food, the bigger the ice crystals. The bigger the ice crystals, the more damage freezing does to the food structure and the food quality. So many veg such as lettuce leaves, mushrooms and cucumbers do not fare too well in their natural state due to their high water content.  There are ways around this, though, with the use of cooking or pulping and even changing the way you use your food. But on the whole, meat, fish, peas, sweetcorn and even aromatic spices all respond well to freezing in their natural forms. When it comes to freezing, it doesn’t have to be either-or. Fresh bananas can be happily whipped up into a smoothie during the winter with the punnet of summer berries that were tucked away in the freezer. And for many products that don’t freeze well on their own, they can be frozen just fine if they have been cooked in a rich sauce first. These days frozen offerings are not restricted to fish fingers and pizzas, innovation in the industry has brought about a raft of premium frozen products. You can even tempt your palate with such delights as bass fillets in a crispy lemon and herb tempura now appearing in frozen aisles near you.  So in the words of the other famous “Frozen” – you know, the Disney one – perhaps, when it comes to our snobbery over frozen food, it’s time for us to just “let it go”."

Snow blankets Romania. Source, and more photos: Severe Weather Europe
This of course is in stark contradiction to the earlier projections of snow would be a thing of the past. WetterOnline here also reports of snow in Romania with photos. Again this only reinforces the trend that Europe has been cooling over the past 2 decades.
The cold is expected to intensify over the next few days with surface frost spreading widely across much of Central Europe.
I guess I’m going to have to give up on palm trees making it up here.

"Thanks to the wonders of online democracy, Britain’s new £200m scientific research ship could well set sail with the distinctive name: “Boaty McBoatface”. The decision by the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to submit the choice of a name for the ship to a public online vote has led to unprecedented publicity – and an unexpected front runner. In a statement NERC said that the RRS Boaty McBoatface, if it is indeed given that name, would: “help put the UK at the forefront of ocean research for years to come”.  Whether investigating the water column or exploring the earth beneath the sea, research ships around the world essentially help answer big scientific questions about our planet that we simply couldn’t have done by staying on dry land.  The UK’s fleet, including the RRS (Royal Research Ship) James Cook and RRS James Clark Ross, can be used to investigate the water itself or the life in it. Scientists on these ships can also remotely measure the seafloor using ship-mounted, towed or autonomous instruments which can help visualise things in high-resolution. They can also grab samples from the seabed itself or use coring devices to sample depths of up to 55 metres using systems such as the British Geological Survey’s RockDrill 2 (RD2). The UK remains a leader in the fields of oceanography and marine geology and geophysics and the new NERC polar research vessel, scheduled to come online in autumn 2019, should help sustain that position. Other, larger, research ships are primarily tasked with drilling, sampling and measuring what lies below the seabed in much the way the oil and gas industry does. These include the three ships run by the long-standing International Ocean Discovery Program(IODP), an international consortium of 26 countries including the UK.  The IODP’s fleet is used to help answer questions related to climate and sea-level change, the origins of life, and geohazards, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. IODP also hosts more “blue-sky” projects, for example an expedition scheduled to start this April will drill and sample the crater from a meteorite impact that is alleged to have led to the demise of the dinosaurs. Participating in a research cruise is the equivalent of fieldwork for marine scientists, with hard hats, life jackets and steel toe-capped boots in place of rock hammers and hiking boots. Scientists are typically expected to work a shift pattern which will vary depending on the sort of work being done, but could be 12 hours on and 12 hours off. This pattern is worked seven days a week for the duration of the project which may range from a week to a few months.   A typical day is punctuated by meal times (every six hours or so) and “smoko”, a short break similar to a coffee break, with the remainder of on-shift time taken up by work in laboratories, on deck or behind a computer. Off-shift time allows scientists to relax and use the ship’s facilities which may include a gym, a library, a TV lounge and a sauna (though I am yet to encounter a masseuse, which is where Wes Anderson’s The Life Aquatic strays somewhat from the truth). Want to set sail on RSS Boaty McBoatface? The recruitment of scientists on research cruises depends on the ship and the project. For NERC ships, projects are usually proposed by a member of the scientific community and it is typically down to the principal investigator of a project to recruit scientists to staff the project. Other programmes, including the IODP, have a more open and formalised system for recruitment, with calls for applications to sail going out on a regular basis. We know ice is melting at either end of the world. Research is critical to help us understand what this means for the climate, sea levels, ocean circulation and for our ecosystems. The new vessel will be able to stay out at sea for longer than the UK’s existing research ships, and will be better at breaking and travelling through polar sea ice.  It will also have advanced communication and data handling systems, as well as the capability to deploy new generation robotic autonomous and remotely-operated vehicles. A hole in the ship, known as a moon-pool, will allow easy sea access for large instruments or even a drilling rig. As with most other research ships, multidisciplinary international collaborative science will be at the new polar vessel’s core, with the remit of providing timely answers to high level climate and ocean research questions.  So, what do we name such a versatile and technologically advanced ship which holds so much promise? My own vote went to RRS FitzRoy, after the captain of Charles Darwin’s HMS Beagle and father of the shipping forecast, but Boaty McBoatface certainly has the world’s attention."
"The recent and ongoing flooding of urban areas in northern England and the Scottish borders has in part been caused by unprecedented rates of rainfall. However, this is only one of the factors that contribute to the development of a flood wave passing down a river. Centuries of alteration to how our river catchments (or drainage basins) function has undoubtedly exacerbated the risk of downstream flooding in every river area in Britain. Rivers are inherently variable, but those with floodplains tend to flood in these areas every couple of years with deeper more extensive flooding occurring less frequently. Sometimes riverbeds also deepen as part of a natural adjustment and in these cases flooding would also be less frequent. Most often, though, floodplain inundation has been reduced deliberately through dredging, embanking, straightening and clearing, which concentrates flood flows in a main channel. These alterations to the landscape have fundamentally altered surface and subsurface flow processes. They include a strategic network of drains and ditches cut by landowners and managers (often with government grants) to improve floodplain land for agriculture to prevent surface flooding and waterlogging, and dredging and embanking which helps to contain flow within a river. Improved drainage in our upland moors through the cutting of a network of drainage channels means that upland precipitation or snow melt is also now concentrated into channel networks more quickly and flows downstream into river valleys faster.  All of these interventions move water more quickly downstream instead of capturing it in the soil or naturally inundating valley bottom areas where it flows more slowly. Government plans to relax current rules will see this drainage network extended and improved to the detriment of the main river flood regime and those living and working downstream. Natural flood risk management includes measures to store and slow flow in catchments more effectively with the aim of reversing the long-term trend of moving water downstream as quickly as possible and restoring some functionality to beleaguered uplands and floodplain areas. It would make sense to try to restore some of the storage function that catchments used to perform before they were so expertly drained. Keeping water in the catchment area for longer means that the flood wave in the river will be longer but at a generally lower level than we currently see during heavy rainfall. This effect has been known from early studies in catchments such as Plynlimon in Wales, and Coalburn and Balquidder in Scotland. The recent floods in the north-west were linked to record rainfall figures – Cumbria, for example, saw 341.4mm of rain in 24 hours. The flooding that occurred in Carlisle in December 2015 surpassed the 2005 event which generated a flood peak that exceeded the one in 200-year event that is the standard of protection for the city and followed extreme rainfall in the River Eden catchment area. Rapid deployment of an sUAV (a Small Unmanned Air Vehicle) after the event captured imagery and evidence of the flood’s extent. It revealed that the entire floodplain along the main river and its tributaries was active during the heavy rainfall, along over 60km of surveyed watercourse. This has obvious implications when evaluating the value of natural flood management measures for an event of this magnitude.  Small storage measures and obstructions erected in channels, including bed raising and feature restoration such as removing or relocating banks, will have slowed and stored water even though it eventually reached capacity. It is critical that flow on the floodplain is slowed relative to the main channel and it appears from the morphological activity and infrastructure damage across floodplain areas that this was minimal. The role of the floodplain would seem obvious in controlling downstream flooding yet it did not prevent flooding in Carlisle. It seems that in big events, attempts to increase the natural physical storage of water in the catchment is not going to stop urban areas flooding – but does this mean that natural flood risk management is ineffectual when it comes to preventing urban flooding during extreme events? Sadly, we still don’t have answers for this. We simply do not know how much land compaction caused by livestock and farm machinery and poorly-timed planting and cropping has increased surface runoff, how significant or even how extensive our surface and subsurface land drainage network is in relation to flood wave generation, or just how dysfunctional our river floodplain system is. One thing is certain. The floods have left a vast amount of evidence and information in the Eden and other catchments impacted by the recent flooding and we must act to capture these data before they are lost. And national and local government, insurance companies and funding agencies must seriously consider the following as part of their response: The Environment Agency must release all of its flood image archives to allow the role of catchment floodplain inundation to be quantified for all recent and historic floods. This will tell us whether, like the Eden, the floodplain is being fully utilised during extreme events or if physical capacity remains to store and slow floodwater. We need improved flood models that provide a fully integrated whole river and floodplain understanding of flooding. The capacity and data to develop 2D flood models now exist. Such a model would allow for a realistic simulation of catchment interventions such as natural flood risk management. The impact of land management must be rapidly evaluated across catchments impacted by the recent floods. Drainage efficiency is clearly visible in the catchment areas as they recover from the flooding: compacted soils show signs of erosion and water-logging; patterns of redistributed sediment shows how flows were concentrated; and we can see how efficiently soil has drained from rapidly drying fields. These data can form a spatial map of areas that can impact the generation of flood flow and could allow the strategic deployment of alternative land management measures. Small-scale, piecemeal natural flood management measures are not the answer to controlling the flooding in Carlisle, and the Eden catchment is evidence of the ever present risk of extreme events. However, large-scale, long-term management of the catchment is exacerbating problems for urban areas downstream. Government ministers talk about appropriate catchment and floodplain management, but this can only realistically be achieved through the development of evidence-based mapping. This offers a clear and focussed way forward that will allow holistic planning of flood reduction measures. We have a near unique and certainly time-limited opportunity to gain a greater understanding of these impacts and must take targeted and immediate action to gather this information before it is lost."
"So, there is to be a fifth Indiana Jones film. Sadly, the much-loved movies don’t represent the average day at work for most archaeologists, but there is more truth to Indy’s swashbuckling adventures than you may think. Crystal skulls do exist, the Nazis really were (very) keen on archaeology, and the world’s museums are full of artefacts taken from unsuspecting tribal peoples. Here are some of the more surprising things the films got right. Some of the artefacts featured in Indiana Jones are not as ridiculous as you might think. Crystal skulls (made from Quartz), as featured in the fourth film, do exist – there’s even one in the British Museum. Unfortunately, they are probably 19th-century forgeries, rather than original pre-Colombian – or alien – artefacts.  And while we have never found it, at least nine countries, including Ethiopia and Egypt, are rumoured to be the location of the lost Ark of the Covenant, the wood and gold chest central to Raiders of The Lost Ark and rumoured to contain the stone slabs etched with the Ten Commandments.  The Holy Grail, featured in Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade and which supposedly featured at the Last Supper and caught the blood of Christ during the crucifixion, is even more of a mystery. It does not actually appear in literature until the early 12th century, in a legendary tale of Joseph of Arimathea, in which the grail is sent for safe-keeping in Britain. Real or not, however, all of these legendary artefacts do reveal a truth: that many archaeologists have a personal “holy grail”. It is probably not an actual artefact – it is objects’ relationships with other things, people or structures that actually allow us to interpret the lives of past cultures. We do not aim to collect objects, we aim to answer questions about how and why human societies change. That is our Grail quest.  Nazis were the villains of both Raiders of The Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, which again isn’t far from the truth. For the Nazis, archaeology was central to “proving” their arguments for Aryan superiority. Nazi research missions under the guise of the Ahnenerbe were dispatched to a surprising variety of places in order to “demonstrate” the influence of Aryan migrants in prehistory, including Poland, the Andes and Tibet.  Perhaps most telling are the works of Gustaf Kossinna, whose book German Prehistory: A Pre-eminently National Discipline set out the archaeological justification for the annexation of Poland. Kossinna based it on the supposed presence of Germanic peoples there during prehistory, and while he died before Hitler came to power, he was active while the territorial negotiations at the Versailles conference after World War I were taking place.  So Indiana Jones fighting Nazis is an honourable and historically accurate portrayal, even if the modern battleground against nationalist pseudo-archaeology has now shifted to Twitter. A rather strange mish-mash of ideas in the Temple of Doom did have some basis in fact, although very loosely interpreted. The Thuggees, led in the film by the sinister Mola Ram, were a notorious criminal fraternity, suppressed by the British in colonial India. The film’s mistreatment of Kali is rather more obvious, however. Despite popular iconography – the fangs, red eyes and penchant for blood – this Hindu goddess is generally revered as more than just a destroyer and is a rather more nuanced force than the one represented in the film.  This quote, from The Last Crusade, possibly is the most famous line spoken by Indy – and the most problematic for archaeologists and museums. It reinforces the idea that Western academics have a right to excavate and display the world’s cultural treasures. Indeed, major national museum collections, from the British Museum to the Louvre were founded on this very belief – but, in a post-colonial world, this attitude has become hotly contested.  Do artefacts belong in museums? Or do they belong to the people from whom they were taken? What if those artefacts were removed more than a century ago, from a tomb built 4,000 years ago, from a place now occupied by people who have no relationship with the original inhabitants? These are the ethical questions museums must struggle with. For example, debates over the return of the Parthenon (or Elgin) Marbles to Athens from the British Museum are long running; Cambridge students recently voted to return to Nigeria a bronze cockerel which was removed in 1897; and artefacts even became embroiled in geopolitics when Egypt severed ties with the Louvre Museum over the return of Ancient Egyptian remains.  What is certain is that each claim for repatriation must carefully be weighed on its own merits. Indiana Jones didn’t always appreciate this. Archaeology really can be adventurous. Maybe not adventure of the poisoned darts and jumping over chasms variety, but the moment when you unearth something really exciting, anything from a sarcophagus to a 10,000-year-old worked flint nodule (depending on your interest), is the reason archaeologists stay in the business.  Of course, occasionally it can be dangerous, too. Just consider Lord Carnarvon and the Curse of Tutankhamun – practically an Indiana Jones plot device.  Personally, I am still waiting to be offered a course in basic whip-handling, and I own a trilby rather than a fedora – perhaps a little more Time Team than Indiana Jones. But while we now avoid sacrificing our students to angry sun gods – even if only because of the health and safety paperwork – if a new major Hollywood movie is a reflection of the central place of archaeology in our cultural consciousness, then I think we should all be pleased.  One final point. The drinking competition in Nepal in Raiders of the Lost Ark? Maybe not in the Himalayas, but from personal experience … that was dead accurate."
"Kristalina Georgieva is very keen to talk about the research one of her International Monetary Fund economists is doing. Surprisingly, this is not about any of the issues that have gripped the organisation in the past 75 years: balance of payments crises or global recessions. It is about whales and the part they play in the fight against climate change. “Whales act like giant pumps,” says Georgieva, noting that in its lifetime each of these mammals sequesters 33 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while an average tree absorbs about 20kg a year.  Comments like this from the new managing director of the IMF have seen her getting some stick since she took over as managing director from Christine Lagarde at the start of October. With the world economy slowing and another financial crash looming, some who attended the IMF’s annual meeting in October said in private that Georgieva was spending too much time on climate change and not enough on the institution’s bread and butter: maintaining financial stability and helping countries in economic trouble. Georgieva is unrepentant. The climate crisis and financial stability are linked, she says, because if left unattended, global heating will threaten financial stability. “When people say we should be sticking to our mandate, I fully agree,” she says. “That’s exactly what we are doing.” Asked which she sees as the bigger risk, another global crash or global heating, she replies: “Climate change is an existential threat. It is a risk that we all have to take very seriously because from the perspective of an institution that deals with economic matters, it can push back development. We have seen that repeatedly over recent years.” She is speaking before a meeting of COP25, the UN climate change summit in Madrid this week that will monitor progress towards meeting the carbon-reduction pledges made in Paris four years ago. Georgieva, who was number two at the World Bank before getting the top job at the IMF, says it makes sense for her organisation to play a prominent role in the fight to prevent temperatures rising to catastrophic levels, and insists the crisis is an opportunity as well as a threat. “In a world that’s eager for higher growth, this is an opportunity to accelerate investment in low-carbon technologies and speed up the transition to a low-carbon world.” The industrial revolution was the start of a period that led to tremendous improvement in the people’s lives, but at a cost, she went on: “The law of unintended consequences means it has created problems, but they are problems we can solve.” Many environmentalists see a contradiction between the IMF’s pursuit of growth and its new mission to tackle climate change. Georgieva disagrees: “These things are not necessarily against each other. You can have growth and it can be clean, green, sustainable and equitable.” She says her message to the COP 25 is simple: “We all recognise the risks. Now is the time to concentrate on action.” Georgieva says the IMF is looking at two specific areas where it thinks it has a role to play: tax and spending policy, and making the financial sector more resilient to global heating. On the fiscal side, the fund is pushing for a carbon tax that would reflect the damage burning fossil fuels causes to the planet. This is currently levied at an average rate of $2 a tonne; the IMF thinks it should be increased to $75 a tonne by 2030. Georgieva recognises that this might present difficulties in the current political environment, with protests against higher fuel prices in both developed and developing countries.  “A carbon tax will push up prices, and therefore you have to identify who will be vulnerable in advance – not after the tax hits. You have to give people certainty that they are not going to be negatively impacted, and that you are not going to create a poverty or inequality problem by tackling a climate problem.” The IMF is working in three areas of financial sector reform: tougher standards so that banks and other institutions have to come clean about their exposure to climate risks; action by central banks to stress-test the financial system; and building on work by the insurance industry to put a price on climate risk. “We need to accelerate action. We need to recognise that the impact of climate change is not just already visible, but tends to hit the world’s poorest countries and poorest people hardest.”  Countries that have actually done very little to cause the problem are the ones most affected, she says, citing the Sahel, the Horn of Africa, Yemen, the Caribbean and small states in the Pacific ocean. “They have done virtually nothing to create the problem and yet are the most impacted. On their own they can’t slow climate change, which is why the world needs to work collectively. The reality for those already affected is the reality for the rest of us tomorrow.” Despite already toxic levels of pollution in China, a recent study showed that the country had installed five times as much energy capacity from coal over the past 18 months as had been mothballed by the rest of the world in the same period. Georgieva says India and China – the two biggest emerging economies – know that they need to make the transition to renewable energy. But she has a warning for the IMF’s members. “Countries need to recognise that we are running out of that most precious commodity – time.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m short on time today, and so I’m reposting the latest on current El Nino – by German skeptic site wobleibtdieerderwaermung here.
======================================
For the first time in over two months the Southern Oscillation Index SOI rose 4.6 points and thus points to a possible normalization of the atmospheric pressure relationship and thus an eastward tradewind over the equatorial Pacific.
This indicates a development I mentioned a few days ago: El Niño Update November 2015: Peak Already Reached?
…The index for the difference of the surface atmospheric pressure between Darwin (Australia) and Tahiti (island located at the Pacific equator) in October 2015 was -21.3  (previous month -16.7) as a 30-day moving SOI, i.e. clearly well into El Niño range of below -7. http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/#tabs=SOI 
The SOI is considered to be the two-month lead indicator for the development of the easterly trade winds at the equatorial Pacific and thus for future ENSO development.
At the end of October 2015 the SOI was clearly up after two low points in August:

Moving 30-day SOI from the Australian Weather Office BOM, end October 2015, with a steep drop in June 2015 and a low point in August and a jump upwards in October. Has the SOI reached its low point…? Source: http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso
Only should this development continue can a weakening of the positive ENSO conditions be expected as a consequence…”
This development indeed is continuing for the time being as the latest SOI chart shows a steep climb in the still very negative values in November 2015:

During the past two weeks the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) has remained strongly negative, but has risen toward more moderate-strong values compared to two weeks ago. The 30-day SOI value to 8 November was −15.6.Sustained positive values of the SOI above +7 typically indicate La Niña, while sustained negative values below −7 typically indicate El Niño. Values of between about +7 and −7 generally indicate neutral conditions. Source:  http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/enso/
On 10 November the value of the 30-day moving SOI is -13.96, and thus has risen even further. Latest Southern Oscillation Index values (Long Paddock)
The El Niño range is departed when the value of -0.8 is exceeded.

"As giant icebergs bob across the open seas they leave behind a trail of nutrient-rich meltwater, sparking new life in the world’s remotest and least hospitable oceans. This in turn means more carbon is taken from the atmosphere and stored below the waves. Massive icebergs may be a symptom of climate change – but they can also help keep it in check. “Giant” icebergs are technically those at least 18km in length. At any one time several dozen are afloat in the Southern Ocean, and individually they can survive for up to a decade. They make up roughly half of the ice discharged from Antarctica, so around 1000km3 per year – equivalent to the annual flow of the Congo River. However these icebergs come in fits and starts. Some years hardly any break off, whereas five of the biggest icebergs recorded in the satellite era broke off into the Southern Ocean during 1999-2003. So a big iceberg year can have a huge impact. In fact, during previous ice ages huge “iceberg armadas” from Northern Hemisphere ice sheets are believed to have redirected the Gulf Stream – albeit thanks to melting on a slightly larger scale. It’s clear then that meltwater from giant icebergs can directly impact circulation of the Southern Ocean, and the climate above it. However, in a recent paper in Nature Geoscience, colleagues at the University of Sheffield and I have shown there is also a significant impact on the carbon sink, and hence the rate of exchange of CO2 between the ocean and atmosphere.  Here’s how it works: as Antarctic ice sheets slowly slide towards the ocean they bump along the continent’s bedrock, picking up iron and other nutrients which become imprisoned within the ice. When icebergs melt they release these chemicals into the sea. As icebergs are essentially freshwater, their water is buoyant and ascends to the ocean surface, where the iron and nutrients are utilised by phytoplankton – tiny plant-like organisms at the bottom of the marine food web.  This makes a big difference in the Southern Ocean, where limited dissolved iron – important for cell growth – restricts productivity despite an abundance of nitrate. Melting icebergs release iron in a bio-available form, so encourage phytoplankton growth, photosynthesis, and the draw-down of atmospheric CO2. Giant icebergs are especially important as we found the increase in productivity from their meltwater could be as much as a factor of ten above background levels, and extend hundreds of kilometres away from the melting iceberg, both upstream and downstream. At fixed points, the effect could last for up to a month after passage of an iceberg. This is a far larger impact on the surrounding ocean than the limited previous observational studies had found, and could provide as much as 10-20% of the net carbon export into the deep waters of the Southern Ocean. We’ve only accurately tracked giant icebergs since the 1980s so it’s difficult to know exactly what the future holds. However, the increasing amounts of ice discharged from Antarctica in recent decades, combined with likely acceleration of change under global warming, suggests we’ll see more giant icebergs in future. If this were so, the enhanced productivity of the Southern Ocean, taking more CO2 from the atmosphere, will act as a small check on global warming. What of the Arctic? Icebergs are abundant in parts of the northern oceans, as the Titanic tragedy showed. However, those calved from Greenland are only very rarely more than a kilometre or so long, and are almost never “giants”. The North Atlantic also has plenty of iron, mostly thanks to Saharan dust carried there in the atmosphere. The Arctic and North Atlantic are therefore missing key ingredients for a strong biological response to iceberg meltwater.  However, large amounts of freshwater entering the North Atlantic could affect the meridional overturning circulation, a current which sends the Gulf Stream northwards along the surface while cooler, deeper water moves southwards. More icebergs from Greenland, or further ice melting due to global warming, may help slow this current and check climate change. Fortunately, the Northern Hemisphere no longer has the large ice sheets with a history of instability that could cause this sort of “Day After Tomorrow” scenario.  So if any giant icebergs are going to help slow climate change they will likely come from Antarctica, one of global warming’s most symbolic places."
"Jeremy Corbyn has promised to plant 2 billion trees by 2040 to help arrest the climate crisis.  Planting billions of trees across the world is one of the most effective and cheapest ways of taking carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the atmosphere. Through the process of photosynthesis, they absorb and store the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving global heating, making them natural carbon sinks. The government has officially committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The official adviser the Committee on Climate Change says the UK must plant 1.5 billion new trees by 2050 to meet that target, or 50 million a year. Planting 2 billion trees in the next 20 years would be the equivalent of sowing 100 million a year, so Corbyn’s promise to plant more than that 10 years ahead of the target effectively doubles the requirement. That is the equivalent of three trees planted every second, day and night. While this sounds incredible, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility. One man in Northumberland who has launched a private woodland has planted more than 2 million trees in 12 years. Labour's 'green new deal' - or 'green industrial revolution' - proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs, and transforming the way people live - from upgrading the housing stock to revitalising public transport, tackling the UK’s air pollution crisis to moving towards a more sustainable agricultural model. Although the initial investment would be huge, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging economic benefits in the medium term, positioning the UK at the forefront of the emerging green industries, which are expected to dominate in the coming years. Crucially, the green new deal would tie radical environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. Its advocates say jobs in carbon-intensive industries would be replaced by – among others – those in wind, solar, house building and transport infrastructure. Labour's manifesto put the green new deal at the centre of its 2019 election campaign. The idea has also been championed by leading Democratic presidential candidates in the US 2020 race. Internationally, its supporters say any such proposal must also recognise the west’s historic responsibility for the crisis - and its global nature - and support a just transition in the developing world through transfers of technology and finance, while welcoming migrants. Matthew Taylor Experts at the Woodland Trust say overshooting the planting target will be necessary given annual losses and threats to existing woodland and hedgerows – including everything from Network Rail clearing trees from sidelines, or the removal of around 5,500 trees from Sheffield by the council. But, they say, planting trees is not the only requirement. “On one side, you need expansion, but you also need to protect the natural regeneration of trees and woodlands, to stop inappropriate development and to understand more about pests and diseases,” such as the devastating ash dieback which is a danger to 120m trees, said a spokesman for the trust. It is currently fighting around 1,000 cases of threats to ancient woodland, 108 of these from HS2. So, it says, expansion must happen not just to increase the number of trees, but also to mitigate losses. The Labour plan is ambitious but not out of sync with expert thinking."

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’m feeling cynical this evening. Off topic…
How incompetent and clueless are Europe’s leaders?
Well this may be the first time in human history that Europe has chosen not to defend itself against an invasion. In fact it is even surrealistically welcoming it!
Dear Islamists, you have been dreaming a long time of overrunning Europe, with many of you thinking it will involve patience and might take some decades, or even a century or two. Well, good news for you – your wait is over! It can be yours in less than 10 years! It’s for real. Tens of thousands have already done it.
Why now? Never have European leaders been so incompetent, naïve, and so generous. They are welcoming you with open arms, gifts, food, money, free healthcare and warm places to stay. They want to show the whole world how good and moral they are – because they are suffering from a guilt trip of some strange sort.
Now is the time!

Now more than ever Islamic leaders need to be telling their flocks to spread the word, and to pack up and leave for Europe immediately. The continental borders to the south have totally collapsed – now wide open for crossing. Patchy resistance you might run up against is easily just run over by just a couple dozen men. Nobody is checking anything anymore.
Security for European citizens? What for? That’s not important anymore. No one is checking! We know you are all peaceful.
No passports? No problem. You can get them made in Turkey, or any other country along the way. Real passports are only for citizens.
So come on over! It’s wonderful here. Many are even ready to put you up in their homes should you need a place to stay. It really is so. The motto: “My home is your home!”
We are even ready to serve your every wish. Really.
We’re one happy world without borders now.

================================
After a globally warm October 2015 the unfalsified satellite data from UAH and RSS show that mid tropospheric temperature dropped significantly in the first 10 days of November: -0.5°K.
After reaching high levels in October the daily recorded global mean temperature at 7500 m for the year 2015 in the UAH chart has at times fallen below those the during the El Niño impacted years of 2014, 2010, 2009, 2005 and 2002 (click to enlarge):

The 2015 satellite measurements (lilac curve) at 7500 m altitude were at a high in October, yet during the first ten days of November (white box) temperature was clearly under the years 2014, 2010, 2009, 2005 and 2002: Source: AMSU-A Temperatures.

Also the daily recorded mean global 2m temperatures eased to +0,361°K after the October record value of +0.495°K deviation compared to the WMO climate mean, putting it so far only at 4th place for the month of November:

Analysis of global 2m temperatures show that November 1-10, 2015 had a deviation of 0.361 K compared to the commonly used modern WMO 1981-2010 climate mean. Source: http://models.weatherbell.com/temperature.php. 
While the ongoing powerful El Niño event that has been taking place since the summer of 2015 allows us to expect a further 5-month delayed global warming as seen in October, November so far is pointing to no record value with the satellite temperature measurements and with the 2m temperatures.
Of course we have to wait and see if it stays that way. See: ENSO Update: SOI-Tageswert erstmals seit zwei Monaten positiv – El Niño beginnt zu schwächeln… or here in English at NoTricksZone.

"In a post-apocalyptic future, what might happen to life if humans left the scene? After all, humans are very likely to disappear long before the sun expands into a red giant and exterminates all living things from the Earth.  Assuming that we don’t extinguish all other life as we disappear (an unlikely feat in spite of our unique propensity for driving extinction), history tells us to expect some pretty fundamental changes when humans are no longer the planet’s dominant animal species.  So if we were given the chance to peek forward in time at the Earth some 50m years after our disappearance, what would we find? Which animal or group of animals would “take over” as the dominant species? Would we have a Planet of the Apes, as imagined in popular fiction? Or would the Earth come to be dominated by dolphins, or rats, or water bears, or cockroaches or pigs, or ants? The question has inspired a lot of popular speculation and many writers have offered lists of candidate species. Before offering any guesses, however, we need to carefully explain what we mean by a dominant species.  One could argue that the current era is an age of flowering plants. But most people aren’t imagining Audrey Two in Little Shop of Horrors when they envision life in the future (even the fictional triffids had characteristically animal features – predatory behaviour and the ability to move).  So let’s keep the discussion to animals. This is for practical rather than philosophical reasons: by some standards the world is now and always has been dominated by bacteria despite the nominal end of the “age of microbes” some 1.2 billion years ago. This was not because bacteria ceased to be, or declined in prevalence, but rather because in our myopia we tend to place more importance on the large multi-cellular organisms that came after. By some accounts four out of five animals is a nematode (a roundworm), so from all these examples it’s clear that neither prevalence, abundance nor diversity is the prime requisite for being a “dominant” form of life. Instead our imaginations are captured by large and charismatic organisms. There’s an undeniable degree of narcissism in the human designation of dominant species and a strong tendency to award the title to close relatives. The Planet of the Apes imagines that our closest primate relatives could develop speech and adopt our technology if we gave them the time and space to do so.  But non-human primate societies are unlikely to inherit our dominance of the earth, because the apes are likely to precede us to extinction. We are already the only living hominid that’s conservation status is not endangered or critically endangered and the kind of global crisis that would extinguish our species is unlikely to spare the fragile remaining populations of the other great apes. In fact, any extinction event that affects humans will probably be most dangerous to organisms that share our basic physiological requirements.  Even if humans succumb to a global pandemic that affects relatively few other mammals, the great apes are precisely the species that are most at risk of contracting any new diseases that drive us from the Earth. Will another, more distant, relative (primate, mammal, or otherwise) develop intelligence and human-like society? That too seems unlikely. Of all the species that were arguably dominant animals at some stage in the history of the Earth, humans are alone in their remarkable intelligence and manual dexterity. It follows that such traits are neither requirements for being dominant among animals, nor particularly likely traits to evolve. Evolution does not favour intelligence for its own sake, but only if it leads to higher survival and reproductive success. Consequently it’s a profound mistake to imagine that our successors are likely to be especially intelligent or social creatures, or that they will be capable of speech, or adept with human technology.  So what can we safely speculate about the dominant species, some 50m years after humanity? The answer is both dissatisfying and thrilling all at once: while we can be reasonably confident that it won’t be a talking chimpanzee, we otherwise have no idea what it will look like.  The world has seen a number of mass extinction events in the course of its history. The diversification of life following each event was relatively rapid – and the “adaptive radiation” of new species produced new forms including many unlike the ancestral lineages that spawned them after surviving the prior extinction. The small shrew-like creatures that scurried beneath the feet of dinosaurs in the late Cretaceous period looked very different to the cave bears, mastodons and whales which descended from them during the age of mammals. Likewise, the reptiles that survived the late Permian extinction some 250m years ago, which killed off 90% of marine and 70% of terrestrial species did not clearly foreshadow the pterosaurs and dinosaurs and mammals and birds that descended from them.  In Wonderful Life: the Burgess Shale and the Nature of History, the late Stephen J. Gould argued that chance, or contingency, as he called it, played a great role during the major transitions of animal life. There is room to argue about the relative importance of contingency in the history of life, which remains a controversial subject today. However Gould’s insight that we can hardly foreshadow the success of modern lineages beyond a future extinction is a humbling reminder of the complexity of evolutionary transitions.  So while it may be possible that, as many have speculated, the ants will take over the Earth from us, we can only imagine what their dominant ant descendants will look like."
"The discovery of hundreds of extremely well-preserved dinosaur fossils in China in the 1990s, some in the postures they adopted at the moment of death, has kept scientists busy ever since. The finding led to comparisons with the Roman city of Pompeii, where citizens were entombed in the falling ash from the volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius.  But while this is a reasonable comparison, a closer look at the sediments around the small town of Lujiatun in north-east China, where the fossils were found, suggests volcanic ash may not be to blame for the death of the dinosaurs. The fossils, stuck in time as thee-dimensional skeletons, are truly unique considering most other fossilised dinosaurs and birds from the same region and era (125m years ago) were flattened, albeit often showing evidence of feathers and hair. The dinosaurs, birds and small mammals at Lujiatun were found within rocks full of volcanic ash. It initially seemed they were all buried together after a huge eruption created a catastrophic ash cloud. A dog-sized horned dinosaur known as Psittacosaurus is Lujiatun’s most common find. Scientists have dug up both isolated individuals and clusters of five or six juveniles, which appear as if they had been buried together. The discovery of another dinosaur, Mei long, which is preserved curled up in a bird-like sleeping position, was what lead to the suggestion that the animals had been killed by poisonous volcanic gases and then buried. Recently, different groups of researchers have investigated the sediments that produced the Lujiatun fossils. They have suggested that volcanic mudflows (lahars) – a destructive slurry of ejected volcanic debris and boiling water – buried the one group of young Psittacosaurus, while another Psittacosaurus specimen was described as having been overcome by a different type of volcanic debris flow. However, we don’t know exactly what location and which rocks they come from, so it’s hard to be sure.  This is a symptom of a much larger problem in Chinese palaeontology, where many fossils are excavated by local collectors. They often make it into museums without important information about the exact location of the find. In the summer of 2013, my colleagues and I went to visit Lujiatun village. We wanted to work out exactly where the fossils were coming from and whether they had originated from a single event.  We made a detailed study of the fossil-rich sediments around the village. Once we identified the rocks the fossils were coming from, it became clear the fossils had in fact been recovered from multiple levels of depth, pointing to a number of different burial events.  Detailed study of the rocks in the field and microscopic sections showed that the sediments were very rich in volcanic material, but did not show the combination of characters we would expect from a deposit produced from an eruption of volcanic ash (airfall deposits), such as abundant melt fragments. We found that the sediments had a predominantly volcanic source, but were subsequently transported by flowing water. Evidence for this comes from graded bed boundaries and well rounded sedimentary rock fragments, as well as isolated vertebrate material which shows clear signs of transport. Our interpretation then is that Lujiatun is not a Chinese Pompeii at all. Some dinosaurs may have been killed by frequent eruptions in the area, but most of the fossil finds represent single animals and clusters that had been overwhelmed by water-borne ash and volcanic shards that were picked up and reworked by intense bursts of rainfall. The animals were borne along by a churning, porridge-like sheet flood that swamped and drowned them in its rapid motion. Some animals preserved in the Lujiatun deposits seem to have been resting when they died but it is clear that not all of them were. Even for those that are curled up, it is debatable whether these are really sleeping postures. Since there is no evidence to link the multiple burial events directly to volcanism or other possible releases of toxic gases it has yet to be established whether these animals were alive when buried. But it does seem clear from the completeness of specimens that they were quickly buried and not transported considerable distances. The rocks themselves contain a wealth of information about the environment that dinosaurs such as Psittacosaurus lived and died in. What’s more, studies such as ours help to demonstrate the importance of considering the deposit as a whole, and the indispensability of fieldwork. It is sometimes too easy to accept a seductive and dramatic story. But the world is often more complicated than that."
"Inky the wild octopus has escaped from the New Zealand National Aquarium. Apparently, he made it out of a small opening in his tank, and suction cup prints indicate he found his way to a drain pipe that emptied to the ocean. Nice job Inky. Your courage gives us the chance to reflect on just how smart cephalopods really are. In fact, they are real smart. Octopus expert Jennifer Mather spent years studying them and found that they not only display the capacity to learn many features of their environment, they will transition from exploration to something approaching play if given the chance.  For example, Mather recounts the way two octopuses repeatedly used their water jets to blow an object towards an opposing stream of water in their tank: what she describes as “the aquatic equivalent of bouncing a ball”. Further, as Mather explains, cephalopods are inventive problem solvers. When predating clams, for example, octopuses will use a variety of strategies to remove the meat from the shell, often cycling through strategies – pulling the shell open, chipping the shell’s margin, or drilling through the shell – in a trial-and-error way. It’s not just cephalopods, of course: lots of non-humans are intelligent too. In their own kind of way, lots of machines are smart as well – some are better than the best humans at some of our most complicated games. You can probably sense the question coming next. Does this mean lots of non-humans – octopuses, crows, monkeys, machines – are conscious? And if so, what do we do about that? Such questions are attracting a lot of interest. In the past month alone, leading primatologist Franz de Waal has written on anthropomorphism and consciousness in chimpanzees; philosophers and science writers have discussed consciousness in artificial intelligences and whether machines could become self-aware without us realising; and the neuroscientist Michael Graziano has argued that current theories of consciousness are “worse than wrong” while predicting that we’ll have built a conscious machine within 50 years. Yet it’s hard to know what kind of mental life non-human animals actually have, and whether it is anything like ours. If it is, does that make it wrong to eat them? Or consider machines, which may develop mental lives of their own at some point. We’re ill-prepared to recognise if or when this will happen, even if we may eventually come to have moral duties towards machines. The best thing I’ve read lately on consciousness in non-humans is the short story, The Hunter Captain, by the philosopher and fiction writer David John Baker. It involves an alien race that encounters a human being for the first time. According to their neuroscience, it turns out that the human lacks the special neural structure they believe necessary for generating consciousness. Like all the other animals they have encountered, including the talking animals they violently kill at the table before eating, the human is merely intelligent but lacks consciousness. As such the human has no moral status – she is something to be hunted, or enslaved. As you might expect, the human demurs. Some alien-human debate on the philosophy of mind ensues. Baker’s story dramatises very well two key decision points we face when worrying about consciousness in non-humans. The first revolves around whether consciousness is the key thing needed for moral status – that is, the thing you have that generates moral reasons to treat you in certain ways (avoid harming you, respect your rights). Even if consciousness is key, it’s not clear where we draw the line: some say moral worth requires the kind of consciousness associated with feeling pain and pleasure (phenomenal consciousness), others point to the kind associated with self-awareness, or self-consciousness. The second decision point surrounds the nature of consciousness, and whether a certain level or type of intelligence is enough. If so, just how clever do you have to be, and how do we measure that? Even if intelligence alone isn’t enough to warrant consciousness, it might not be psychologically possible for us humans to confront a highly intelligent being without feeling the urge that it is conscious. Should we trust that urge? Consider, again, the octopus. We can tell from behavioural evidence that they are intelligent. But it is not clear how intelligent they are, or whether that is even the right question. Octopus intelligence is shaped, in part, by octopus needs – the kind of mind they have and need is dependent upon their evolutionary history, their environment, and their body-type. Given these factors, it makes sense to say that octopuses are highly intelligent. Consciousness might be closely tied to the particularities of human-like intelligence. But given how little we know about consciousness, it seems foolhardy to believe such a thing at present. Other questions demand a hearing. Do octopuses feel pain? They certainly seem to, although the sceptic might claim that all they do is react to stimuli as if they were in pain. Are they self-aware? We do not know. On these difficult questions, there is very little consensus. My aim here has been to work up to the questions. Because there is an obvious sense in which we all have to decide what to think about these questions. We all already interact with arguably conscious non-human animals of various levels of intelligence, and many of us will at some future point interact with arguably conscious machines of various levels of intelligence. Unlike Inky the wild octopus, speculation about consciousness in non-humans isn’t going anywhere. In conjunction with Oxford University’s Practical Ethics blog"

Share this...FacebookTwitterBefore COP21 assembled in Paris last month, there was a sense of optimism that a new climate treaty to replace the long-expired 1997 Kyoto Protocol for reducing “greenhouse gas” emissions would be hammered out.
But now that COP 21 is approaching its scheduled end, we are finding out from the media that representatives are a long way from any effective CO2 reduction agreement. No one believes the COP21 summit is going to end tomorrow – rather expect it to drag out possibly into early next week, or even beyond. After all, when it’s about “saving the planet”, there’s no going home early.
The online German center-left DIE ZEIT here today describes a climate of growing chaos and diminishing order: “Almost every country has expressed reservations against the draft treaty at the climate summit.”
Among other countries DIE ZEIT blames Saudi Arabia, which threatens “to pull their support for the core goals of the treaty“, and India and Malaysia which are holding out for “greater commitments from rich countries“. According to DIE ZEIT there is neither agreement on financing for the poorest countries nor agreement on a limit in how much more the world should be permitted to warm.  DIE ZEIT writes:
The Saudi Arabian representatives have indicated that they do not want to accept any long-term target of limiting the warming to a maximum of 1.5°C.”
Another sticking point brought up by DIE ZEIT is the issue of whether to stop the burning of coal completely, or to just reduce it. On this point agreement seems unlikely given the number of coal-fired power plants now under construction and the hundreds more in planning. Developing countries may express their intention to some day stop coal in a new treaty, but they will certainly push the task off to future generations. It’s hard to imagine a number of struggling countries agreeing to forego the use of cheap and plentiful coal.
According to DIE ZEIT, environmental groups observing the negotiations and examining the latest draft are saying that the text in the treaty would lead “only to a weak reduction in greenhouse gases”.
So what is shaping up? Overall expect to see a treaty that will be very painful for rich industrial countries ($100bn per annum), but one that will be completely toothless against rising global CO2 emissions.

"The question of whether warfare is encoded in our genes, or appeared as a result of civilisation, has long fascinated anyone trying to get to grips with human society. Might a willingness to fight neighbouring groups have provided our ancestors with an evolutionary advantage? With conflicts raging across the globe, these questions have implications for understanding our past, and perhaps our future as well. The Enlightenment philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau had different visions of prehistory. Hobbes saw humanity’s earliest days as dominated by fear and warfare, whereas Rousseau thought that, without the influence of civilisation, humans would be at peace and in harmony with nature. The debate continues to this day. Without a time machine, researchers examining warfare in prehistory largely rely on archaeology, primatology and anthropology. Earlier this year, details of one of the most striking examples of prehistoric intergroup violence were published – 27 skeletons, including those of children, had been found at Nataruk near Lake Turkana, Kenya. Blades embedded in bones, fractured skulls and other injuries demonstrated this had been a massacre. The bodies were left, unburied, next to a lagoon on the lake’s former western shore, around 10,000 years ago. The Nataruk finds are claimed as the earliest evidence for prehistoric violence in hunter gatherers. A 12,000-14,000 year-old cemetery at Jebel Sahaba in Sudan was previously thought to be the first, but its date is less certain and some have claimed that since the bodies were buried in a cemetery they were linked to a settlement, and not true hunter gatherers. The evidence for warfare becomes clearer in the archaeological record after the beginning of the agricultural revolution around 10,000 years ago, when humanity moved from hunting and gathering to farming settlements. War may have existed before then, but there are few remains from the early days of Homo sapiens, and causes of death can be extremely difficult to ascertain from skeletons. This means that at the moment, the archaeology remains inconclusive. Animal behaviour studies provide another means of exploring the debate. Jane Goodall’s discovery that chimpanzees make war shocked the world. A group in Tanzania were observed beating members of a rival community to death, one by one, before taking over the defeated group’s territory. Despite attempts to dispute Goodall’s findings, similar patterns of behaviour were later discovered in other groups, and evidence for warfare in one of our closest relatives became indisputable. However, bonobos, also known as pygmy chimpanzees, share as much DNA with us as chimps do, but are overall more peaceful, despite some anecdotal reports of aggression between groups. This is partly attributed to differences in the two species’ social systems. For example, bonobos’ societies are female-dominated, which perhaps keeps male aggression in check, whereas chimpanzees’ social hierarchy is male-dominated. How did our last common ancestor behave? Were they like bellicose chimpanzees or peaceful bonobos? Although parallels between all three species are fascinating, using them to answer this question is difficult, as ultimately each followed its own evolutionary pathway. But chimps demonstrate that war without civilisation does exist in a species similar to our own. Not only that, but similarities can be seen between chimpanzee and human hunter-gatherer warfare. For example, in both species, an imbalance of power and risk-averse tactics are often a feature of attacks: a group of chimpanzees will assault a lone rival, and hunter-gatherer groups avoid pitched battles in favour of guerrilla warfare and ambushes. Anthropologists, whose knowledge of “traditional” societies could provide clues as to how our ancestors behaved, also took sides in the Hobbes-Rousseau debate. Margaret Mead’s research on Samoan islanders led her to conclude that “warfare is only an invention”, which had not existed before civilisation, while Napoleon Chagnon reported that among the Venezuelan Yanomamö, fighting and raids on enemy villages were commonplace. Both were criticised: Mead for overlooking widespread evidence of violence in Samoa, and Chagnon for inappropriately using a society of small-scale farmers as a proxy for prehistoric hunter-gatherers. Of course, any traditional society that anthropologists choose to study has still been exposed to outside influences. And they differ vastly from one another, not least in their participation in warfare. But early accounts suggest that lethal aggression did exist between some hunter-gatherer groups before their contact with other societies.  Waldemar Jochelson, who studied the Siberian Yukaghir in the 1890s, described them as having persecuted their enemies like “wild beasts”. Similarly, the Andamanese, from isolated islands in the Bay of Bengal, had longstanding feuds between themselves and participated in dawn raids on enemy camps. It’s difficult to conclude that prehistory was free from intergroup aggression. Military historian Azar Gat and evolutionary psychologist Stephen Pinker, among others, argue that warfare existed before the agricultural revolution. Pinker also claims that violence has overall decreased over the centuries. This may seem difficult to believe given the gloomy headline news in 2016, but such a zoomed-out view of history at least suggests hope for the future. A version of this article first appeared on the NERC DTP blog."
"It was, by any measure, a giant. On January 17, patrol helicopters off the coast of southern Australia reported seeing a great white shark “nearly as big as Jaws”. In fact, it was estimated to be up to 23ft long, only marginally smaller than the infamous movie killer – and it came to within just 100 metres of the shore. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the connotations with Peter Benchley’s 1974 novel sent the internet into its usual frenzied panic when such a “monster” is spotted.  Last summer, videos of what many believe to be the largest white shark ever caught on film also sent the internet into meltdown. These large sharks will always make headlines, but instead of igniting fear, they should be cause for celebration.  In recent years, many sharks – including the great white – have been severely reduced in numbers, with some species down by 90%. While calculating the precise numbers of individuals is difficult, there are promising signs that some white shark populations are now on the rebound. This is in part due to measures put in place to protect both the sharks and their main prey, marine mammals. The sharks have either been killed by targeted commercial fishing for their fins and meat, or accidentally caught in other fisheries. Elsewhere, they are hunted for trophies, grandstanding profile pictures or because they are seen as a threat to humans. It has been estimated that between 63m and 273m sharks could be killed every year by fishing. Populations have reached such low numbers in places that some species now are at a high risk of extinction.  Which makes the latest sighting very special indeed. At a time when many species are struggling, such a large shark is a rare sight.  There is a famous tendency to exaggerate the size of fish – and sharks, in particular. The referenceless of the ocean can make judging distances and length difficult and with no solid means to verify the size of this shark, we can’t say for sure that it really was seven metres long. While coast guards reported that the shark was bigger than their six-metre jet boat, it is hard to extract any biologically relevant information from the fleeting sighting other than it was a big shark doing what sharks do.  What we can say, however, is that large great white sharks are usually the old ones. And they can get really quite old. In fact, a recent study found that white sharks might live as long as 70 years. These older sharks are great for the population, because they have had ample opportunity to reproduce, introducing offspring into a dwindling population.  But in all the Jaws-style fanfare, it’s important to look also at how the local community has dealt with the sighting. In many places around the world, just as in the film Jaws, we might have seen a large-scale hunt undertaken to capture the “man-eating” monster and stop it from killing on their beaches.  Indeed, Western Australia recently controversially lifted the protective status of great white sharks and implemented a shark cull along its coast in an attempt to boost tourism after a spate of fatal shark incidents. But the programme came under huge criticism for failing to capture a single white shark and killing many other species not involved in recent fatalities.  Destroying sharks to increase beach safety has been widely criticised by the scientific community due to the huge impact that these methods can have on many aspects of the ecosystem. In the past, countless technologies and protocols were developed to reduce the number of fatalities from shark incidents, but with no unifying answer.  But the latest sighting offers fresh hope. What we have here is a community that is learning to share the ocean with these important ocean predators. Shark Alerts South Australia (SASA), the Facebook page where the initial sighting was shared, is emblematic of a community accepting the beauty and significance of the great white.  Following the sighting, local ocean events were cancelled and “shark sirens” were sounded. But while ocean users exited the waters, helicopters and boats were deployed not to kill, but to herd “the large white shark out to sea”. All the while SASA were sharing the information with its 55,000+ followers.  The community driven Facebook page is updated regularly and allows potential users to think twice before entering potentially dangerous situations. Last year they reported about 170 to 180 sightings, but as their followers continue to increase, so will their reports. This is a great example of how social media and advances in technology can help reduce the number of incidents, while educating people at the same time.  In Western Australia, tagged sharks are now “using” Twitter to alert ocean users to their presence near local beaches. And in the scientific world, new technologies and autonomous underwater drones are being used to observe previously unseen habitats, feeding ecology and behaviors in great white sharks.  It has been found that many ocean users in Australia often encounter sharks, without harm, and support further research and education. These are all promising signs that we are moving away from the barbaric approaches to mitigating shark incidents. Instead, communities are learning to share the ocean with sharks, even profiting from tourism industries set up specifically to see them.  Sharks are hugely important for maintaining the balance and health of our ecosystems. Learning to live alongside them will be challenging and we still have a long way to go. But with changing perceptions and advances in technology, a peaceful coexistence with “Jaws” may be closer than you think."

=======================================
The Sun in October 2015
By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
In October, 2015, our mother star was less active than in September. The solar sunspot number (SSN) was 61.7, only 72% of what is normal this month into the cycle compared to the mean of the observed cycles since occurring 1755. In detail:
Fig. 1: Our current Solar Cycle 24, which started in December 2008, is shown by the red curve and is compared to the mean cycle (blue) and to the very similar solar cycle 5 shown by the black curve.
What really stands out are negative anomalies that occurred during the cycle ramp-up and the ensuing plateau phase. Until the 54th month the sun was only 47% as active as the mean. But later beginning at about month number 62 the current cycle followed along below the mean closely. Since then the current cycle has been tracing at about 73% of the mean value. Over the entire cycle so far the current cycle has been running on average at 56% of the mean. What follows is a comparison of all cycles:

Fig. 2: Comparison of all the cycles. The bars represent the SSN anomaly from the mean for 83 months into the cycle.

One clearly sees the activity hump in the middle of the 20th century, from SC 17 to SC 23. This was recently investigated at a conference at the end of October, 2015, which worked out the solar forcing for a new generation of climate models (CMIP6):

Fig. 3: Solar forcing for new climate models, source: Matthes & Funke 2015.
The contribution by Katja Matthes of the Geomar Center in Kiel, Germany and Bernd Funke of the Astrophysical Institute in Granada sees an increase of approximately 1 W/m² on average between 1880 and the level of 1950 to 2000 (light blue curve in Fig 3). Now a prediction until 2075 sees a drop in value to that of 1880 (grey in Fig. 3). One, however, does need to be careful with the forecast. The sun is a very dynamic star. Yet, the assumption that the solar irradiance is constant, which was the case in the older models (CMIP5 in light green), is being abandoned.
Today the solar forcing of the sun is assumed to be greater by a factor of 5 over what was assumed just a few years ago (e.g. Feulner & Rahmstorf 2010) when conventional climate science and also the IPCC accounted for a solar irradiance TSI variation of only 0.2W/m².
Clearly the sun is gaining more influence in the world of climate modeling, as it is getting neglected less in the new models. However we will not being hearing anything about these findings from the media during the upcoming Paris conference: There the sun will have no effect on our current climate. The only thing of any concern in Paris is trace gas CO2.

"Where’s Boris? There were any number of theories doing the rounds as to why the prime minister couldn’t be bothered to turn up for the Channel 4 leaders’ debate on climate change. He was terrified it was a BBC set up and that Andrew Neil would sneak out from behind a curtain and shout ‘Gotcha’. He was just too shy to show how much he really cared about the environment. Just as he had been too shy to tell David Cameron that austerity was a bad idea back in 2010. He was exhausted after campaigning so hard to unleash the potential of women. Apart from hopeless unmarried mothers of course. They deserved everything they got. Along with the feckless dads who buggered off. There’s going to be hell to pay when Boris Johnson finds out who fathered some of his children. Just to show how much he really, really wanted to be there, the prime minister sent along his dad and Michael Gove to the Channel 4 studios in his place. After all, Stanley was almost the same as him – give or take a few stray mutant genes – and the Govester had once expressed a vague interest in a polar bear. But Ben de Pear, Channel 4’s news editor, had had to point out that, charming as both men probably were, neither was actually the leader of the Conservatives. And this was a leaders’ debate. In a scene worthy of The Thick of It, Boris then had a temper tantrum at being excluded from a debate from which he had excluded himself and threatened to review Channel 4’s public service broadcasting obligations. Satire had just eaten itself. The debate itself opened with a panoramic set of a world on fire and presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy explaining the Boris no-show and that he had been replaced with an ice sculpture of Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The studio lights were turned on full and right on cue the ice sculpture started melting. There was an identical ice sculpture to represent the Brexit party, who also hadn’t bothered to turn up, but no one was too interested in that one. Rather everyone was openly relieved that they didn’t have to engage with Nigel Farage. After a short video featuring disappearing forests and glaciers, David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg and a dead koala, the five party leaders – the Green’s Siân Berry, Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn, Plaid Cymru’s Adam Price, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon and the Lib Dems’ Jo Swinson – were invited to indulge in some competitive virtue signalling with their opening statements. They all cared a lot a lot, though Swinson also cared about Brexit. Berry insisted she won first prize as she had cared much longer and the others were all arrivistes. She had a point. Corbyn couldn’t believe his luck as he took the first question on climate change targets. Taking one look at the melting Boris, he indulged his obligatory free hit at the Tories. Something each of the leaders would also go on to do. Hell, why not? No one was going to contradict them. If there’s one thing that everyone was agreed on – apart from the climate emergency being very serious – it was that the Tories were basically evil. The Conservatives target was 2050, Corbyn said. Which in reality was 2099. So Boris’s secret plan was to kill the entire planet. He would get stuff done by 2030. Sturgeon and Swinson hurriedly tried to explain why their targets of 2045 really meant that they would be carbon neutral even sooner than Labour. Berry took the high ground and pronounced even 2030 to be defeatist and set her own target of 2029. This quickly developed into a free for all, before Sturgeon, the squabbler in chief, asked everyone to stop squabbling. Remembering they were all there to save the planet, all five leaders held hands and observed a minute’s silence for the burnt koala. Thereafter all five leaders pretty much agreed with each other at every opportunity. People should start to eat a more plant-based diet and everyone should stop flying and take buses. Corbyn even promised to plant 2 billion trees by 2040. Or 200 a minute. There were going to be so many forests, no one would be able to see the wood for the trees. “I’ve got a copy of our green manifesto,” said the Labour leader. “I could have read that online,” Guru-Murthy replied. Corbyn chastised himself and promised to make that two billion and one trees. The debate ended with everyone – even Jeremy who insisted he was already too miserable to turn the heating up – promising to do a lot better. The one exception was Berry who said she was fed up with lists and that we were probably going to die anyway. But even she was up for a group hug come the closing credits. After all there were no winners in a climate emergency. There were losers though. The two ice sculptures that had melted into a puddle on the studio floor.

"Boris Johnson is being urged by 350 leading climate researchers to robustly challenge Donald Trump on his “dangerous” and “irresponsible” denial of the risks of climate change during the US president’s visit to the UK this week. Putting the prime minister under more pressure over his stance on global heating, leading academics involved in climate research said he must try to persuade Trump to take strong domestic and international action.  Johnson – who declined to take part in the first ever UK general election climate debate last week – will meet Trump during his three-day visit for the Nato leaders’ meeting. In a letter to Johnson, the academics said Trump’s “unscientific denial” of the risks of climate change was harming lives, making the world a more dangerous place and threatening the prosperity and safety of future generations. “We urge you to challenge President Trump about his irresponsible approach to climate change, and seek to persuade him to take strong domestic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to join coordinated international action including the Paris agreement,” they wrote. The UK is due to host the a major UN climate summit next year – a meeting which is absolutely vital to international efforts to avoid dangerous climate change, the academics said. They praised the government for passing into law a new target to reduce annual emissions of greenhouse gases to net zero by 2050, but warned the UK was already seeing the effects of global heating. “Earlier this year many parts of the nation were subject to a summer heatwave which reached a record peak temperature and killed several hundred people,” they wrote. “Lives and livelihoods are also being threatened by increasing risks of flooding due to heavy rainfall and sea level rise.” They warned that Trump’s stance risked making the world a more dangerous place. UK security assessments in 2015 warned that disruption of populations as a result of the climate crisis would increase political instability, conflict and migration. The US director of national intelligence said this year climate change and environmental and ecological degradation across the world were likely to fuel economic distress and social discontent from 2019 onwards. The letter highlighted false claims made by Trump, who said recently that the Paris agreement would mean “shutting down American producers with excessive regulatory restrictions like you would not believe, while allowing foreign producers to pollute with impunity”. The White House’s website also wrongly describes the agreement as “fraudulent, ineffective, and one-sided”, the signatories said. The signatories to the letter include Tim Atkinson, a professor of environmental geoscience at University College London; Sarah Bracking, a professor of climate and society at King’s College London; and Nick Eyre, a professor of energy and climate policy at the University of Oxford."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBernd Atzenroth of central Germany’s online Märkische Allgemeine Zeitung (MAZ) reports on how a stork had its beak and main feathers chopped off by a wind turbine blade. So severe were the bird’s injuries that the animal had to be euthanized.
Photo of gruesomely injured bird
According to the online news site, the town of Struck is the location of a wildlife rescue center where injured animals are brought in for care.  Sadly the MAZ writes: “On Friday it was a stork, but it could not be treated – that’s how bad the injuries were.”
The site features a photo of the gruesomely injured bird. If you’re looking for a poster-child for depicting the hazards of wind turbines to wildlife, this is it.
The MAZ describes the reaction of the directors at the wildlife rescue center:
Angie and Uwe Löblich of the wildlife rescue center in Struck are used to seeing a lot. But the appearance of a stork that had been delivered to them on Friday left them speechless. We were struck with horror to see that the white stork was missing almost half of its beak, likely it had been chopped off by a nearby wind turbine.’ Also the left main feathers were missing. ‘The beak and the main feathers had been cleanly chopped off, and there is no doubt that it must have flown into a wind turbine,’ Angie Löblich is certain.”
Nature conservation groups playing down the hazard
One might think that nature conservation groups would be alarmed and outraged by the incident, especially in view of the fact that worldwide wind turbines kill an estimated millions of birds and bats annually. But this is hardly the case. For example Germany’s flagship nature conservation group NABU plays down the problem, maintaining that it is small compared to the hazards created by automobiles. According to the MAZ, NABU continues its staunch support of wind energy and believes the problem can be solved with planning.
Rare, protected species falling victim
The MAZ writes that this stork was hardly the first victim and describes a crane having part of its head chopped off, and of multiple birds dying at the rescue center or having to be euthanized shortly after their arrival. Included among the victims of wind turbines are rare and protected birds such as the honey buzzard, goshawk and Red Kite.

Share this...FacebookTwitterStefan Rahmstorf’s Nightmare
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
When facts and arguments stop convincing, then the only thing left to do is to argue at an emotional level. Climate activists have produced a website where IPCC-cozy scientists expressed their concerns in hand-written letters. One of the writers was Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). He wrote of a frightful nightmare:

Source: isthishowyoufeel.weebly.com
Not nice, but this can happen if one calls in the fire brigade for nothing countless times. Eventually the credibility gets completely destroyed and the fire brigade prefers to just stay on alert and play cards. Panic spreaders damage the credibility of the precautionary principle.
See for example:
– Climate false alarm in Hanover: The big Stefan Rahmstorf Show at the Environment Committee of the Lower Saxony State Parliament
– IPCC-friendly group of climate activists withdraw video: Rahmstorf study no longer the scientific consensus
– New study by Durham University downgrades Rahmstorf’s flood scenario for North Carolina to a fairy tale

"The government is investing more than £300m in building what George Osborne has described as the first “proper” garden city in nearly a century, near Ebbsfleet, Kent. To understand what garden cities are, and why they should be invested in, we need to go back a bit – in fact, more than 100 years. At the turn of the 20th century, Ebenezer Howard proposed building a constellation of towns, each with about 32,000 residents. Famously expressed through a series of diagrams, these towns would be largely self-contained places to live and work. They would be located around industrial cities like London which themselves, over time, would be decentralised into smaller garden city-style settlements. All these places would be linked by electric rail and canal to permit the easy movement of people and goods.  Howard wanted to control what he called the “smoke fiend” of polluting transport, which was already blighting cities at the turn of the century. The idea was to give people the chance to get away from London’s rank conditions and offer them the best of town and country combined: healthy air; affordable, good quality housing; and (mostly) local food, facilities and jobs. Many of Howard’s intentions were realised in two garden cities: Letchworth Garden City, built from 1903, and Welwyn Garden City, built from 1920. The idea of garden cities – and especially garden suburbs and towns – took off around the world including in Scandinavia, Australia, the US, South America and Japan. In many places, hybrids emerged, building on both garden city ideas and related traditions such as Utopian settlements, industrial villages and the City Beautiful movement. Before and between the two world wars, there were plenty of garden villages and garden suburbs created in the UK, including the famous and beautiful example of Hampstead Garden Suburb. But there have been no more garden cities built in the Britain since Letchworth and Welwyn.  After World War II, a number of “new towns” were built following the New Towns Act of 1946, with examples including Stevenage, Hatfield, Telford, Runcorn and Milton Keynes. The new towns, though, have drawn a much more mixed response than the garden cities that preceded them. While sometimes criticised as places to live, many new towns have strong support from residents and proponents of their social purpose and design. More recently, in the light of increasing worries about making new places sustainable, a previous Labour government tried to develop a number of so-called ecotowns on former airbases and other pieces of leftover land, but most of these weren’t built after local communities rejected them. Over the last 40 or 50 years, there has also been quite a lot of pretty ordinary housing developed by builders in dormitory estates. These have tended to make places which are just residential – not proper towns.  Many people aren’t impressed with the way that postwar housing estates in cities have turned out either; this was most recently reflected in prime minister David Cameron’s announcement about redeveloping the hundred “worst” housing estates. All of this means people usually aren’t too keen to hear that any new housing is being built near them – as any scan of local newspapers makes abundantly clear. One thing has stood out though. Most people still really like garden cities. They like the Arts and Crafts houses designed by Barry Parker and others at Letchworth and the delicacy and refinement of the red brick neo-Georgian architecture of many of Welwyn’s houses and public buildings. They appreciate the numerous trees and avenues that make the garden cities feel fresh, green, open and pleasant to walk around.  And in Letchworth, they value the way that money which comes from the town’s landholdings (things like farms, shops, office buildings and so on) is poured back into the local community by the town’s governors, as part of a unique arrangement whereby people who live there get extra health facilities and other valued services.  With this context in mind, the UK funding announcement, made by the country’s chancellor, George Osborne, starts to make sense. England is having a housing crisis. In the south of the country, where the economy is strong, there aren’t enough places to live. In the north, there are problems caused by low demand for housing, because economies there have been suffering for a long time. For governments of any complexion, the upshot is that supporting new garden cities increasingly looks like a good idea as a way to help supply more houses – and to make homely towns to live and work in instead of sprawling housing estates people have to commute from for jobs and services. It’s particularly important that the garden city brand is still a positive one: there seems more chance that people will be less opposed to new garden city developments than they would be to other kinds of settlements. They may even welcome them.  The garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn were created without any government support, and their early days were fairly financially precarious as a result. But now the government is prepared to help with substantial financial contributions to at least three new garden settlements, with Bicester and north Essex in addition to Ebbsfleet.  New garden villages – like one on the edge of Hatfield in Hertfordshire – are being planned, and some people advocate them as a way to solve the housing crisis.  Of course, garden cities will not be the only way to meet housing demand in England’s south-east. What’s more, there’s a risk that they might not be put in the right places in terms of transport, suitable land, population and housing need – just where land is available. It’s not really clear how far new garden cities in northern locations could help revive local economies and deliver Osborne’s “Northern Powerhouse”. There’s also some anxiety that they could infringe on the green belt, which many hold sacrosanct. These are all valid points.  But despite these fears, I remain optimistic that in supporting a new round of garden cities and other kinds of garden development we are heading in the right direction. My university did some detailed consultation and design-based work on this idea in 2008, and again in 2014. It remains clear garden cities could work well as part of any new development balance. I’d like to see a number of different kinds of settlements created to make beautiful, diverse, affordable and compact places – and that would include both new garden settlements and remade housing estates. Garden cities are not the whole answer, but they could and should be an excellent part of the mix."
"Children and young people in more than 100 towns and cities across the UK are walking out of classrooms on Friday for the latest youth strike to highlight the escalating climate crisis. Strikers are focusing on the polls next month, which they have pledged to make a “climate election” by demonstrating the growing public concern about the ecological crisis. The events in Britain are part of a global climate strike by tens of thousands of people in more than 150 countries from Chile to Madrid in Spain, where next week’s UN climate summit will take place. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired the movement when she staged a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament last year, said despite millions taking to the streets those in power had taken no meaningful action. “World leaders say they hear us and that they understand the urgency,” she said. “But in one year of climate strikes, nothing has changed, nothing. “For every step made forward, we went five steps back. The scientists say we have never been less likely to stay below 1.5 degrees [above pre-industrial levels].” Friday’s action comes after more alarming news on the scale and scope of the climate crisis. This week scientists warned the world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points posing an “existential threat to civilisation”. Two days earlier a separate study from the UN’s World Meteorological Organization revealed that the concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere had hit a record high. The climate crisis has emerged as one of the key issues in the UK election. On Thursday evening the main party leaders – except the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who refused to participate – took part in a climate and nature TV debate. Beth Irving, from the UK Student Climate Network, which helped organise Friday’s strikes, said it was crucial political leaders were held to account over their plans to tackle the emergency. “The upcoming election will determine how the UK addresses climate change, with significant effects for the planet and its people. We have just a small window of time for action and the next few years are crucial.” The strikes are part of a global movement that began in August last year when Thunberg began a weekly solo protest outside Sweden’s parliament. Since then millions of people in thousands of towns and cities around the world have taken part in an effort to raise the alarm. Public concern over the climate is now at its highest recorded level, while a majority of voters say climate will influence how they vote in the upcoming election. In September, 300,000 people in the UK joined the last global climate strike, which coincided with the United Nations climate summit. Irving said: “Over the last months, young people have taken to the streets to demand strong climate action but many of us cannot vote; this week we will be taking to the streets to make our voices heard. This must be a climate election.”"

=====================================
The online Spiegel has an article that really drives home the energy hardship that German consumers are suffering, “due to the rising costs of electricity“, brought on by the country’s hasty rush into green energies.

Hundreds of thousands of Germans struggling today without electricity. Image cropped from here.
It is not only Germany’s power companies who are bleeding to death financially, but so are many private citizens, who are unable to pay for their power. A shocking situation in one of the world’s most technically advanced nations.
According to the German flagship news magazine, citing the federal Bundesnetzagentur (German Network Agency), more than 350,000 households saw their power get switched off in 2014. Spiegel blames the “Energiewende” (transition to renewable energy), writing in its sub-title:
The social problems of the Energiewende are growing: Last year more households than ever saw their power get switched off. The reason is the rising price of electricity.”

Spiegel also provides the figures for the previous years, and they too are horrific. In 2013 close 345,000 households lost their power, and in 2012 it was about 320,000. Over the past three years it all totals to be a whopping 1.025 million households!
In a country of 82 million, the figures are socially explosive.
Threatened 6.3 million times
It’s a glaring paradox of the Energiewende: On the production side, power plants are losing billions of euros because they can no longer even get a modest price for their power, while on the consumer side more and more households are unable to afford the skyrocketing prices brought on by the mandatory infusion of expensive and unstable green energies into the German power grid. The once mighty German power grid now teeters on the brink of crumbling.
The situation threatens to get far worse. Spiegel writes that “far more households have problems with their electric bills. According to the Bundesnetzagentur power utilities threatened their customers with power cut-offs 6.3 million times.”
Spiegel writes that the price of electricity in Germany has doubled since 2002 in large part because of the renewable energy feed-in surcharge. Private households are the hardest hit; they have to pay some 45% more than the EU average (while German power producers get 30% less than the EU average)! The government-interfered market is grotesquely distorted.
Spiegel reports that even more costs are on the way for 2016 with the average household expected to pay on average 40 euros per year more.

"Nuclear power can be a touchy subject, one that seems to divide opinion. Many people believe it is unclean, controversial and costly – and the 2011 Fukushima disaster showed the world just how unsafe nuclear can be; the meltdown of the power plant was the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in Ukraine, 25 years earlier.  On the other hand we still need nuclear power. It has decreased the UK’s dependence on fossil fuels such as gas, coal and oil, which are in limited supply. And nuclear is a much more reliable energy source – for the same amount of fuel, nuclear produces much more energy than its carbon-based counterparts. And, as well as being cost effective, it also produces little waste. The chancellor of the exchequer, George Osborne, now wants the UK to be a “global leader in innovative nuclear technologies”. Part of this plan involves spending £250m on a research and development programme to put the UK in with a chance of “winning” the race to develop small modular reactors (SMR). In the recent Budget, Osborne launched a competition for the “best value” design of small modular reactors for use in the UK. The government has also said it plans to publish a small modular reactor delivery “roadmap” later this year and will allocate at least £30m for an advanced manufacturing programme to develop nuclear skills. All of which will pave the way towards building one of the world’s first small modular reactors in the UK in the 2020s. Given the amount of investment, it’s clear SMRs are big business for government – and for good reason: experts suggest that small nuclear reactors may be the key to a low-carbon future. Small modular reactors are essentially scaled down versions of full-sized nuclear reactors. They are defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency as having a power output of up to 300MW – which is enough to power around 428,000 700-watt washing machines. This compares to a full sized nuclear power reactor which boast around 1,000MW – more than three times as much. Each person in the UK uses an average of 226 Watts throughout the year, and a typical SMR can theoretically produce enough power for roughly 1m people using 226 Watts.  Compare this to the largest commercially available wind turbine installed in Denmark which usually runs at 26% of capacity. This equates to supplying 9,203 people – making the difference in output huge. At the other end of the size scale, the new nuclear power station which will be built at Hinkley point C over the next decade or so will have a capacity of 3,200MW – which will be able to provide energy for more than 14m people, more than ten times the power of any SMR. But what SMRs lack in size and output they make up for in accessibility and the small amount of time it takes to build them. The main benefit of SMRs compared to full-sized reactors is probably financial – the capital start-up costs are far lower,  reducing the cost risk for any interested builder. Another advantage over full-sized reactors is that most countries are better equipped for smaller power loads than bigger ones – the national electricity grid of some countries cannot handle the huge power load from a full-sized power station – they would simply overload and shut down – so SMRs would be ideal in these circumstances. The modular design of the SMRs also ensures they can be manufactured and assembled at a central factory then sent to their new location where they can be installed relatively easily. This is particularly useful in remote locations which might not have the best manufacturing facilities.  SMRs also have good safety features including a natural cooling feature which comes via an underground cooling mechanism. This can continue to function without external power because the primary coolant system uses natural circulation so there are no pumps required – making it an ideal safety feature against core meltdown – which was the problem in Japan when the 2011 tsunami hit. Then there is also the advantage of being able to locate the reactor underground, providing more security and protection from natural hazards, such as high winds. The obvious drawback is the increased running costs – each kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity from an SMR would be expected to cost between 15% and 70% more than a kWh of electricity produced in a full-sized nuclear power station, due to economies of scale. This means power output decreases while other costs stay constant. There are also the usual public fears surrounding nuclear power generation and nuclear waste – which can make SMRs a hard sell, although some of the designs use a “breeder facility”, which helps to reduce the waste output. Design features such as this combined with an increase in knowledge surrounding SMRs should help to avert public fears over safety.  There are already a number of SMRs in operation around the world including in India and China. There are also numerous other SMRs in various states of completion too, from the 35 MWe KLT-40s which is under construction in Russia, to the Molten salt-based reactor still in the design stage in the UK.  The government’s SMR competition is a great step forward in taking things closer to development. Once funding has been allocated to a preferred design then there’s just a small matter of building one. So while the use of SMRs may be one step closer, it is still going to be some time before these smaller nuclear reactors are in widespread use across the UK."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel has the latest analysis of the climate haggling going on at COP21. It looks pretty heated.
From science journalist Axel Bojanowski‘s perspective, the representatives have encountered some major obstacles. He writes of a “huge clamor” and reports that the treaty is on the brink. He writes, citing delegates, the negotiations have been charged with “harsh threats” and “sick pride”:
 China, India, USA, EU and the oil producing nations downright crashed against each other with full force in the negotiations.”
Bojanowski writes of swirling discord over the 2°C target, noting that a group of countries led by the USA and the EU wish to adopt the “highly ambitious” 1.5°C target, which means the planet would only have 0.5°C of allowable warming remaining.
Theoretically that would require an immediate stop in emissions growth – something that in reality is pure fantasy. Saudi Arabia wants nothing to do with the 1.5°C target and, according to Bojanowski, is threatening to “bust the fragile alliance of developing countries, the so-called Group 77”.
The Spiegel report portrays a conflictive atmosphere where developing countries are pitted against industrial ones. The former are demanding that the latter pony up for the “damage” caused and be given leeway in emitting carbon. However the USA delegation insists industrial countries commit to reductions as well, “especially China”, where pro capita CO2 emissions are already approaching EU levels.
Although the media (at least in Germany) are projecting a cooperative and constructive atmosphere in place in Paris, the Spiegel report tells us the opposite, where a huge chasm still remains between industrial developed countries and the emerging countries. Bojanowski writes that the current draft treaty has enraged the USA delegation” because it calls on the developed nation to “allocate financial support” while other countries “contribute voluntarily” – a condition in the main part of the treaty that would never pass the US Congress. China insists that this clause remain in the main part.
Bojanowski writes that China “feels provoked” by the newly formed “High Ambitious Coalition” which comprises the USA, EU and poor developing countries – which China used to represent – and is now “unwilling to compromise“, Bojanowski reports.
The Treaty is far from being ready, and there is still a chance that the whole process could collapse. Expect the bazaar to last through the weekend.

"The UK contribution to the UN’s climate fund should balloon to £20bn by 2030 if it plans to pay a “fair share” to helping tackle the global climate crisis, according to new research. A report from the IPPR thinktank says the UK should “shoulder more of the burden” of the global climate crisis because of its major contribution to the world’s rising carbon emissions.  The left-leaning thinktank found that the UK is responsible for the fifth largest contribution of carbon emissions in the atmosphere since the 1750s. The UK is behind only the US, China, Russia and Germany in terms of its global climate impact. The IPPR called on the next government to radically increase the money it spends on helping to fund green initiatives by almost threefold to match its contribution to the climate crisis with funds to help tackle the environmental breakdown. The UK plans to contribute just £1.4bn over the next four years to the UN’s green climate fund but has not set its budget beyond 2023. The call for higher contributions to funding green initiatives is part of a wide-ranging report on the role industrialised nations should play in tackling the climate crisis to help prevent unprecedented financial and political collapse as a result of the climate chaos. Laurie Laybourn-Langton, an associate fellow at the thinktank, said there is only a chance of averting a global environmental breakdown if countries “take on their fair share of sorting it out”. “The UK is a wealthy country with a large past and current contribution to environmental destruction, so should shoulder more of the burden. In an age of environmental breakdown, justice must be hardwired through all international relations,” he said. The calls to shoulder more climate responsibility comes ahead of the UN’s next round of climate talks in Madrid this month. In 2020 the UK will host the event in Glasgow. Lesley Rankin, an IPPR researcher, said the UK should “forge a positive new role in the world” by coupling its domestic climate ambitions with assistance to help less industrialised countries which are most affected by the environmental crisis. The UK has legislated a target to become a carbon neutral economy by 2050, but continues to support fossil-fuel projects in the developing world through the government’s credit agency, UK Export Finance. A failure to prevent runaway climate crisis could result in “an unprecedented threat to international cooperation” and a breakdown of the “international order”, according to the IPPR. “Whilst nations are turning inwards, the impact of the natural breakdown will be cross border,” the report warned. An environmental breakdown could lead to a global economic crisis triggered by a collapse of the insurance industry as severe weather events increase. It could also lead to forced migration and political upheaval. In 2018 alone over 17 million people were estimated to have been displaced by extreme weather and natural disasters, the IPPR said. The World Bank estimates that 140 million people could be displaced within countries in several regions by 2050."

Share this...FacebookTwitterIf you need more proof that climate change has taken on cult-like dimensions, then look no further than Germany’s Federal Ministry of Environment (BMU), which delivers it in hardcopy in the form of a cookbook for climate-friendly eating.
Now people should eat in a way that makes the climate healthy and weather better – forget what is really healthy for our bodies! Many experts say the two are not the same.
Despite the latest nutritional studies showing the vast benefits of a diet rich in animal fat, the German BMU (which has no expertise on matters concerning human nutrition) is taking it upon itself to advise people to switch to a potentially ruinous fad diet with the highly dubious claim that it will positively impact the climate and weather in our favor.
Human dietary habits worse than auto, air traffic!
The BMU site writes:
Cooking for climate protection. Very simple and very necessary. The atmosphere is heating up from our dietary habits more than it is from automobile or air traffic. The best ingredients for culinary climate protection are: local organic food, less meat and dairy products – and seasonal fruits and vegetables instead of imported finished products. How this can be done in a tasty way is illustrated by the book with its 55 recipes and many vegetarian and vegan variants. There are also lots of information explaining how we impact the climate with our nutrition, and tips on sustainable grocery shopping. Cook and enjoy.”

Let’s be honest here. Some points have merit, like eating more vegetables, and less highly processed foods. However as mentioned above, recent- cleanly executed scientific studies are showing that meats and animal-based fats, like cheese and butter, are necessary for the healthy development of the human body, and have in fact been the cornerstone of the human diet for some 3 million years. The dietary advice now being promoted by the German BMU is a recipe for mal-nutrition and poorer health.
The timing of the WHO organization recently released report claiming processed meats are cancer-causing and putting them in the same category as tobacco and asbestos should not be wonder. The WHO report was immediately slammed and dismissed from all sides. The aim is to get humans to away from meat, and to switch to insects wit the hope of appeasing the climate gods.
Another interesting aspect is that the promotion of nutritional guidelines and dietary fads (this one put together by a gaggle of activists, no less), is not the responsibility of the Ministry of Environment, but rather instead that of the Germany Ministry Of Agriculture and Nutrition. The BMU is way out of bounds here.
Unfortunately, as is the case with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) the German Ministry Of Agriculture and Nutrition guidelines are outdated by decades as well, and are still promoting the notoriously dangerous high-carb, low-fat diet and continues to villianize foods like butter and eggs.
This is all cult gone amok.

"The UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. More than 1,000 British species are at risk of extinction. Polls have repeatedly shown that while the British public may be divided on Brexit, we are united by our love of nature and concern about climate. The charity WWF is urging UK political parties to respond to the nature and climate crisis by committing to bold policies and investment to make the UK the first major economy to halt its contribution to climate change, put nature on a path to recovery and stop deforestation in food supply chains. It says the UK must pioneer an economic and financial system that works for people and planet and drive global ambition to respond to the climate emergency. A hedgehog at Secret World Wildlife Rescue in Somerset, which receives about 600 hedgehogs for rehabilitation every year. In autumn, hedgehogs often struggle to find enough food to put on weight for winter hibernation. It is estimated that UK hedgehog numbers have declined by half since 2000, to fewer than 1 million. The loss of hedgerows for intensive farming, the use of pesticides that kill slugs and insects and the lack of garden habitat is driving the decline. Eight-year-old Afrika holds a ball and wears a mask to protect against air pollution in Dawson Heights, south-east London. Studies have found that fine particles and toxic fumes emitted from vehicle exhausts and wood and coal fires are particularly harmful to children and can affect their lung and brain development. These pollutants are believed to cause thousands of deaths across the UK each year and contribute to health conditions including asthma, lung cancer, heart disease and stroke. The burning of fossil fuels also generates greenhouse gas emissions. Seals such as this pup, in rehabilitation at RSPCA West Hatch in Somerset, face many threats to their existence: increased severe weather and storms linked to climate change can separate pups from their mothers, as can public disturbance from tourists and dog walkers. Adult seals are often killed or injured in collisions with boat propellers or entangled in plastics and fishing waste, and pups can be caught as by-catch in commercial fishing nets. Thousands of students across the UK joined a wave of climate strikes to raise their voices in the climate debate this year. These two protesters with placards attended an event at Parliament Square in London in May organised by the UK Student Climate Network. The global climate strike movement was inspired by the 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and has been supported by millions of people around the world. The Atlantic puffin is a well-known visitor to British shores. It spends the summers in the UK to breed and heads north in the winter to feed in cold Arctic seas. The UK provides a vital habitat for these birds, but numbers have been crashing in some of the UK’s nesting sites over recent years. As with many other species affected by the climate crisis, puffins are already subject to other threats, which a changing climate only worsens. Overfishing is severely reducing their food sources, and the fish populations they rely on – such as sand eels – are becoming less prevalent as the seas warm. The combinations of these impacts could be devastating for UK puffin populations. The sun rises behind the cooling towers of coal-powered Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station and lights up the steam produced from the generation process. Ratcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshire is one of the UK’s few remaining coal-fired power stations. Burning coal generates greenhouse gas emissionsand causes dangerous air pollution, and building the huge infrastructure can destroy habitats. The UK has committed to ending the use of coal in power generation by 2025, and renewables are rapidly becoming cheaper than fossil-fuel generation. A mute swan and mallard duck lie dead among plastic pollution in Manchester. The River Tame in Greater Manchester recently recorded the highest level of microplastics anywhere in the world. Combined with toxic algae in river systems due to rising global temperatures, many water birds are dying as a result of pollution. Six-year-old Elizabeth (left) and eight-year-old Mali watch the tide coming in on the Thames on the South Bank in London. WWF estimates that almost 2.5m homes across the UK could be at risk of flooding by 2050. Damage caused by coastal erosion, flooding of farmland, businesses and infrastructure could cost the nation more than £12bn a year by 2050, according to figures from a WWF study released this week called Global Futures. Climate change, habitat loss, pollution and disease are pushing some of the UK’s native bees to extinction. One in every three mouthfuls of food we eat exists because of pollinators such as bees, which pollinate 75% of leading global crops. Pollinators are estimated to be worth £690m per year to the UK economy, yet in England more than 97% of all flower-rich grasslands have been lost since the 1930s – three million hectares, or an area one-and-a-half times the size of Wales. Flytipping is a major cause of pollution in urban rivers in the UK. Here, a volunteer for the Wandle Trust removes a motorbike from the River Wandle during a monthly cleanup operation. Motorbikes leak toxic fuel, polluting the river directly, while other regularly flytipped items such as car parts, trolleys, safes, bathtubs and armchairs trap silt and smother the natural gravels on the riverbed where plants and animals live and fish lay their eggs. The UK’s rivers are also polluted by water companies and agriculture and fewer than 15% are deemed to be in a favourable condition. Seagrass on the seabed in Porthdinllaen, Wales. Sky Ocean Rescue, WWF and Swansea University have launched the biggest seagrass restoration project ever undertaken in the UK. It is hoped that Seagrass Ocean Rescue will lead the way for a mass recovery in the UK, which has lost up to 92% of its seagrass in the last century. Seagrass, which captures a huge amount of carbon and is a nursery for marine life, is a “nature-based solution”. It could help answer some of the world’s most pressing environmental concerns, including the climate emergency and declining fish numbers. WWF joined more than 130 organisations and 15,000 people in Westminster in June for The Time is Now, the biggest ever environmental lobby of parliament. People from around the UK met face-to-face with their MPs to demand urgent action to tackle the climate and nature crisis. Rachel Haynes was among them, attending a session on how to engage with MPs."
"Białowieza Forest is the kind of place you imagine from the Grimm fairy tales. Huge firs, oaks and ashes tower over you, woodpeckers and other birds call all around you and the guides who work there know the intimate history, and names, of many individual trees.  For anyone, it is a magical place – and, as a forest ecologist, visiting it was a dream come true. However, the features that make it so unique may be under threat thanks to new plans for large-scale logging. Straddling the border between Poland and Belarus, Białowieza is the last remainder of the vast primeval forest that once covered most of Europe. It is a hotbed of biodiversity, home to nearly 20,000 plant and animal species including wolves, lynx and the largest remaining population of European bison. Rare birds, including several woodpecker species, provide a glimpse of the bird life that used to exist in European forests before humans transformed the continent. Unfortunately, on the Polish side of the border, only one third of Białowieza Forest is protected. Outside of this area as much as 35% has been earmarked for felling and the fear is that this will result in an increasingly isolated small “island” of protected forest surrounded by fragmented and poorer quality woodland, which has already been shown to support lower bird populations than the protected park area. Felling around Białowieza has been controlled in the past; quotas were set in 2012 to limit how much wood could be removed. However by 2015, 90% of that quota had already been logged – and the new proposals will triple the permitted volume of logging. The proposal for further logging is controversial. Poland’s state forest department, Lasy Panstwowe, views the felling as necessary to combat outbreaks of spruce bark beetle, the larvae of which burrow under the bark of living spruce trees to lay its eggs. The developing larvae feed on inner woody layers and can eventually kill the tree.  However, both local scientists and NGOs, such as Greenpeace Polska, argue that removing damaged trees will cause more harm than good and that further logging is driven by economic rather than management interests. Professor Tomasz Wesołowski, who has studied Białowieza’s birds for more than 30 years, told me it would be a disaster, as logging and replanting would completely change the quality of the forest habitat and threaten its UNESCO heritage site status. There is even a suggestion that this violates Poland’s environmental commitments under the EU’s Natura 2000 program.  The newly proposed logging areas cover 20% of the old-growth forest, as well as areas overgrown by endangered bog woodland habitat. Mass logging would dramatically alter the character of both the areas in question and the surrounding habitat – even more than the bark beetles.  In fact, across the world this form of “salvage logging” to recover economic value from damaged forests often causes more damage to ecosystems than the initial natural disturbance. After a bark beetle invasion hit Sumava National Park, that stretches across the border between Bavaria and the Czech Republic, evidence showed that salvage logging delayed forest recovery. The proposed increased logging in Białowieza includes removing quantities of dead wood, yet this dead wood plays an important role in the functioning of a healthy forest. Forests are often built from the bottom up, with dead wood as the foundation.  While aesthetically they may not be that pleasing for us, dead trees are a vital habitat for saproxylic insects which feed on dead and decaying matter. Białowieza supports large populations of endangered saproxylic beetles and invertebrates which rely on dead wood and, in turn, these provide food for birds, small rodents such as shrews and voles, and bats including the rare barbastelle. In turn these animals are eaten by larger predators such as owls, wolves and lynx.  Dead and dying spruce stumps are almost exclusively used by some woodpecker species as nests and also act as great hosts for lichens and mosses, some of which are facing extinction in Europe. If the dead wood is removed, the entire forest ecosystem will suffer. Logging is not the only solution to the spruce bark beetle problem. Pheromone traps, for instance, effectively attract large numbers of beetles while outbreaks in the UK are controlled by unleashing a specific predator beetle, Rhizophagus grandis, that targets the spruce beetle. Due to its widespread use in commercial forestry, R. grandis is relatively cheap and readily available, and Forestry Commission research showed it was more effective at controlling outbreaks than salvage logging. In any case, a beetle infestation might be disastrous for individual trees but it won’t necessarily harm the forest itself. Like many ecosystems, Białowieza is vulnerable to climate change. As species such as Norway spruce are weakened by changing climatic conditions, the bark beetle is able to take hold. This is an invaluable part of the forest regeneration process, allowing deciduous trees that are better able to cope with changing climatic conditions to grow in the gaps left by dying spruces. In the long run it may be better for Białowieza Forest to let nature, and regeneration, take its course."
"Hundreds of thousands of young people have taken to the streets from Manila to Copenhagen as part of the latest student climate strikes to demand radical action on the unfolding ecological emergency. School and university students around the world walked out of lessons on Friday with large turnouts in Madrid, where world leaders will gather on Monday for the latest UN climate summit, and Sydney, where protesters demanded action after devastating wildfires.  In London, crowds called for the climate crisis to take centre stage in next month’s election and condemned Boris Johnson for not taking part in Thursday night’s televised climate debate. Millie Hedley, 17, from Watford, said: “I can’t vote, which is very annoying, but I try to do as much as I can to let the government know that all these students here, we want our voices heard.” Frida Roper, 17, said she was suffering from severe “eco-anxiety” as evidence mounted of the scale of the climate breakdown. “I watched the climate debate last night and two of the party leaders didn’t even bother to show up [Tory party leader, Johnson, and Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage]. It’s one of the most important topics regarding everyone’s future, more important than Brexit … if this doesn’t happen, I won’t have a future.” Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired the movement when she staged a solo protest outside the Swedish parliament last year, said despite millions taking to the streets those in power had taken no meaningful action. “World leaders say they hear us and that they understand the urgency. But in one year of climate strikes, nothing has changed, nothing,” she said. “For every step made forward, we went five steps back. The scientists say we have never been less likely to stay below 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels].” In Manchester several hundred young people gathered outside the Central Library at St Peter’s Square, accompanied by lecturers on strike from Manchester University. Holding a placard saying “I’m the only one allowed to fuck up my future”, Keyleigh Waterhouse, 18, said she was striking because politicians were not taking the climate emergency seriously enough. “Boris Johnson not showing up to the Channel 4 debate on the climate showed he doesn’t care. He’s not understood and he’s not bothered.” Eight-year-old Juno Thomas had made a poster saying “Team Greta”. Along with her friend Iris Fenemore, also eight, the girls had walked out of their primary school in Whalley Range, south Manchester, accompanied by Iris’s mother. “If we don’t stop destroying the planet then loads of people and animals will die,” said Juno. Public concern over the climate is now at its highest recorded level, while a majority of people say climate will influence how they vote in the election next month. In September, 300,000 people in the UK joined the last global climate strike, which coincided with the UN climate summit. Friday’s action comes after more alarming news on the scale and scope of the climate crisis. This week scientists warned the world may already have crossed a series of climate tipping points posing an “existential threat to civilisation”. Two days earlier a separate study from the UN’s World Meteorological Organization revealed that the concentration of climate-heating greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere had hit a record high."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLess than one year since Greenpeace was caught permanently desecrating the Nazca Lines in Peru while conducting a publicity stunt during a UN conference, the online Hamburg-based Abendblatt here now reports that the famously radical environmental organization is caught up in another scandal, this one India.
The media reports that India has shut down Greenpeace operations in the country, alleging the that the environmental group made up data and committed financial fraud. The Abendblatt here tells its readers: The government nder Minister President Nerendra Modi accuses the organization of financial fraud and falsifying data. The following is a Youtube video in German:

The Abendblatt writes that this is not the first time the country has clashed with Greenpeace. Prime Minister Modi earlier had criticised the the organization of “putting the brakes on the economic development of the country.”
English-language India-based website NDTV here writes:
Under the latest order issued by authorities in Tamil Nadu where Greenpeace is registered, the government said it had found that the organisation had violated the provisions of law by engaging in fraudulent dealings.
Greenpeace denied any wrongdoing and said the closure was a ‘clumsy tactic’ to silence dissent.”

Speaking of snow, it’s forecast to hit in Germany’s central hilly region later this week. According to WetterKonor here (my emphasis):

On Wednesady it will rain along the coast and over the course of the day a little bit over the far west. From Thuringia and Saxony rain showers will extend out to the northeast. Foremost in the low mountains there will be sleet and snow showers as well. Only in the south will it remain mostly dry, with a mx of sun and clouds. Weak to moderate winds will blow mostly from the northeast.
By the end of the week rain clouds will stretch over Thuringia and Saxony and to the south. There will be local sleet and snow showers in the bag.”

Dr. Ryan Maue at Twitter here presents a chart showing where the snow is most likely to fall in Germany on Wedenesday.

Austria looks to be hit by heavy snow, with some areas forecast to get a foot. One reader asked if such snow events are unusual for this time of the year. The answer depends on weather you are a skeptic or a global warming alarmist. For skeptics this is perfectly normal and is the sort of thing seen over the past 100 years – it’s weather as usual. For alarmists on the other hand, well, they said these events would be rare – even in mid winter. Snow is what we call for alarmists “inconvenient events”.
Is this the start of a brutal and protracted winter?
A number of forecasters have warned that the NAO has flipped, and thus will result in cold air dipping across the continent and bringing a bitter cold winter. Whether that pattern holds, however, is unknown. It could just let up and we could wind up with a mild winter.
But so far things are not starting off well. Already I’m sipping on a cinnamon tea of the kind popular around Christmas.

"A teenager whose family home burned down in the New South Wales bushfires has delivered a message to Scott Morrison at a climate emergency protest outside the Liberal party headquarters, saying: “your thoughts and prayers are not enough”. Shiann Broderick, from Nymboida, said government inaction on the climate crisis had “supercharged bushfires”.  “People are hurting,” she said in a statement before the protest on Friday at the party’s Sydney headquarters on Friday. “Communities like ours are being devastated. Summer hasn’t even begun.” The protests were part of an international day of climate strikes, the movement founded by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. Later, protesters chanting “fuck BHP” gathered around the mining company’s Australian headquarters in Melbourne. The protest was organised by University Students for Climate Justice, one of the groups involved in a two-day protest of an international mining conference in Melbourne, which saw one protester trampled by a police horse, several hit with capsicum spray, a dozen people arrested, and provoked public criticism about the severity of the police response.

"The arrival of snow in the Alps has come as a welcome relief for holidaymakers and ski workers alike. But why was the arrival of healthy quantities of snow so late, and is this something that we should begin to expect in future years? Alpine ski resorts had their worst Christmas for decades. A lack of snow in the run up to, and during, the December left skiers facing thin, icy slopes at a time of year when they could usually expect excellent conditions. Many resorts were almost completely reliant on snow-making equipment – if they were lucky. Some ski areas even resorted to using helicopters to stock up from “snow quarries”. It all started rather promisingly. November 2015 saw the development of a low pressure system over north-eastern Europe, which drew cold air over the Alps, bringing lots of snow and great early season skiing conditions. However, as December approached, an area of high pressure began to dominate and conditions took a nose-dive.  In a high pressure system, dense air descends to Earth’s surface, preventing the formation of clouds and reducing the possibility of precipitation. Anyone who was in the Alps just before Christmas will be able to confirm the beautiful clear, cloud-free skies (I had the sun burn to prove it). High pressure systems in Europe are also associated with a clockwise atmospheric rotation and this forced warmer air from the south-west over the region. These conditions prevailed throughout much of December with the net result that the early snow began to melt and was not replaced; making snow artificially was not always possible as this too requires sub-zero temperatures. Switzerland even had its warmest December on record. For an immediate “cause” of these conditions, Europe’s snow lovers should look towards the world’s two largest oceans. Firstly, the Atlantic. A large difference in atmospheric pressure between the mid-Atlantic around the Azores (high pressure), and the north Atlantic around Iceland (low) has forced stronger than normal south-westerly winds towards the Alps, stimulating higher pressures in the region. The fluctuation in pressure difference over time between the “Azores high” and the “Icelandic low” is known as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), measured by the NAO Index. Studies have confirmed an inverse relationship between the index and snow in Europe, with a high NAOI often being attributed to warmer and/or drier conditions. Meanwhile in the Pacific there’s a particularly intense El Niño at the moment. While no direct links between El Niño and snowfall in the Alps have been confirmed, it is known to impact the climate in Europe through what are termed “teleconnections” – the relationships between atmospheric phenomena that are often thousands of kilometres apart. As such, there is every possibility that this has added to the “anomalies” we have witnessed this year. Here, however, I use the term “anomaly” cautiously as last year also saw similar delayed snowfall – the anomaly this year is therefore not all that anomalous. When examined as a whole, 2014 was the warmest ever year on record in Europe, with 2015 coming in second. Given the third warmest year on record was also in the recent past (2007) these observations would appear to corroborate other evidence of global warming and might, as such, strike fear into the hearts of Europe’s skiers. But any trends are far from clear cut: 2012-13, for example, saw an early, and season-long, bumper snowfall. Academic studies have also found interesting but different patterns such as decades-long variations in Alpine snow since the 1860s, and a decrease in snow-season length from the 1930s to the 1990s, caused not by snow first falling later in the year but by earlier melting in the spring. So what for the future? Is this a temporary blip, or a hint at what we can expect in the future? Well no one really knows for sure. Predicting weather for the next few days is no easy task, so predicting whether the delayed snow falls of late will continue is not something we can do with a high degree of certainty. What is often forgotten too, is that the climate we experience today has been changing for millions of years, so fears of long-term changes based on just a few years of data need to be put into perspective.   However, if the climate continues to warm, as is current scientific consensus, then skiing seasons may indeed shorten, or be displaced, particularly at lower altitude resorts. And what is the prospect for the next few weeks? Well in the short term, more snow is expected but as we move into mid-January, forecast models show there may be a brief return to high pressure conditions before optimal conditions reappear in a few weeks. My advice: get on the piste now while you can."
"The British Isles are blessed with a wide variety of sea mammals, with records showing 29 species of whales, porpoises and dolphins and seven species of seals in its waters. But only some of these are regular inhabitants, and when the more unusual species make an appearance it can cause considerable public interest – as happened ten years ago when a northern bottlenose whale, normally found in the deep Atlantic, instead swam up the River Thames in front of the Houses of Parliament and tens of thousands of fascinated onlookers. While few in the city can have been unaware of what was unfolding in the river, attempts to rescue the whale failed, and it died two days later. The whale, far from its normal habitat, had probably entered the North Sea in pursuit of squid, its principal prey, before becoming lost and, hungry and disoriented, ended up in the Thames Estuary. A post-mortem by pathologists from the Zoological Society of London found the cause of death to be a combination of dehydration, physiological stress, cardiovascular collapse and multiple organ failure induced by the stress of repeated strandings and the attempted rescue.     In truth, the tale of the Thames whale says more about human behaviour than whales themselves. But a decade on, it’s interesting to reflect on what we know about the changing fortunes of the remarkable creatures that live in Britain’s waters. Of the 29 cetacean species recorded around Britain, 15 are regular inhabitants. But we know very little about all but the most common species. Some species such as fin and humpback whales, among the principal targets of the early 20th century whaling industry, show signs of recovery, with a marked increase in sightings.  Minke whales, which are still taken in Norwegian waters but in smaller numbers, also show signs of population growth since the 1980s. This may be related partly to ecosystem changes during the 1960s-70s when fish stocks of herring and mackerel collapsed, seemingly taking the pressure off prey fish such as sandeel and sprat for which the whales competed. However, since the mid-1990s, the abundance of minke whales as assessed by large-scale surveys (SCANS in July 1994 and SCANS II in July 2005) has shown no significant change. The same applies to white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise – although the porpoise is now found more abundantly in the southern North Sea and English Channel, with a corresponding decrease in the northwestern North Sea. This change in distribution may well be related to the abundance of certain prey – sandeel is an obvious candidate since stocks in the northwestern North Sea have declined over the last 20 years. During the 1990s, deaths of porpoises from accidental capture in fishing gear such as gill nets were thought to be unsustainable, which led to the introduction in 2004 of an EU Regulation (812/2004) aimed at reducing bycatch. At the same time, fishing in the North and Celtic Seas where porpoise bycatch was greatest also declined. However, porpoise deaths from fishing vessels continue, with insufficient monitoring for us to be truly confident of the scale.  Another problem facing marine mammals is that of pollutants: contaminant levels in top predators, which bioaccumulate through the food chain, have declined substantially from when PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and pesticides (DDT and dieldrin) were widespread during the mid-20th century. But they persist in the oceans, with PCB levels in particular around the UK linked with disease among harbour porpoises. Other top predators like bottlenose dolphin and orca (killer whale) may also be especially vulnerable. That said, there is no clear evidence of significant overall population declines.   We know much more about seal populations than whales, thanks mainly to the monitoring efforts of the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St Andrews. With an estimated population size of around 112,000, the UK accounts for 38% of the world’s Atlantic grey seals, which appear to be thriving. The majority (88%) breed in Scotland where, since the 1990s, they have been growing in numbers, particularly around Orkney and parts of the North Sea. Only in the Hebrides have pup birth rates remained fairly static. By contrast, harbour seals have not fared so well over the same period. At 36,500, Britain’s harbour seals represent around 30% of the European population. Harbour seal counts (made during the autumn moult) were stable or rising until around 2000 when they began to decline in Shetland (down by 30%), Orkney (down 78%) and the Firth of Tay (down 93%). Other regions have been more stable, with those further south recovering from the devastating effect of the PDV morbillivirus epidemic in 1988 which wiped out more than half their population. We don’t really know what’s behind these changes, but competition for food and the impact of toxins from harmful algae are possible causes.  The effects of climate change on sea mammals is also an issue, due to the effects it has on prey species. The last ten years have seen greater numbers of warm water species such as striped dolphin and Cuvier’s beaked whale, and a new species, dwarf sperm whale, added to those species appearing in British waters. Also, in what might seem like a contradictory trend, a bowhead whale, normally closely associated with the Arctic, made its first UK appearance off the Isles of Scilly in February 2015. It’s likely that the next ten years will bring more changes to the status and distribution of different species as they experience changing environmental pressures."
"At a news conference announcing that 2015 broke all previous heat records by a wide margin, one journalist started a question with “If this trend continues…” The response by the Director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, Gavin Schmidt, summed up the physics of climate change succinctly: “It’s not a question of if…” Even if global emissions begin to decline, as now appears possible after the agreement signed in Paris last December, there is no reasonable scientific doubt that the upward trends in global temperature, sea levels, and extreme weather events will continue for quite some time. Politically and ideologically motivated denial will nonetheless continue for a little while longer, until it ceases to be politically opportune. So how does one deny that climate change is upon us and that 2015 was by far the hottest year on record? What misinformation will be disseminated to confuse the public? Research has identified several telltale signs that differentiate denial from scepticism, whether it is denial of the link between smoking and lung cancer or between CO2 emissions and climate change. One technique of denial involves “cherry-picking”, best described as wilfully ignoring a mountain of inconvenient evidence in favour of a small molehill that serves a desired purpose. Cherry-picking is already in full swing in response to the record-breaking temperatures of 2015. Political operatives such as James Taylor of the Heartland Institute – which once compared acceptance of the science of climate change to the Unabomber in an ill-fated billboard campaign – have already denied 2015 set a record by pointing to satellite data, which ostensibly shows no warming for the last umpteen years and which purportedly relegates 2015 to third place. So what about the satellite data? If you cannot remember when you last checked the satellites to decide whether to go for a picnic, that’s probably because the satellites don’t actually measure temperature. Instead, they measure the microwave emissions of oxygen molecules in very broad bands of the atmosphere, for example ranging from the surface to about 18km above the earth. Those microwave soundings are converted into estimates of temperature using highly-complex models. Different teams of researchers use different models and they come up with fairly different answers, although they all agree that there has been ongoing warming since records began in 1979. There is nothing wrong with using models, such as those required to interpret satellite data, for their intended purpose – namely to detect a trend in temperatures at high altitudes, far away from the surface where we grow our crops and make decisions about picnics. But to use high-altitude data with its large uncertainties to determine whether 2015 is the hottest year on record is like trying to determine whether it’s safe to cross the road by firmly shutting your eyes and ears and then standing on your head to detect passing vehicles from their seismic vibrations. Yes, a big truck might be detectable that way, but most of us would rather just have a look and see whether it’s safe to cross the road. And if you just look at the surface-based climate data with your own eyes, then you will see that NASA, the US NOAA, the UK Met Office, the Berkeley Earth group, the Japan Meteorological Agency, and many other researchers around the world, all independently arrived at one consistent and certain end result – namely that 2015 was by far the hottest year globally since records began more than a century ago. Enter denial strategy two: that if every scientific agency around the world agrees on global warming, they must be engaging in a conspiracy! Far from being an incidental ornament, conspiratorial thinking is central to denial. When a scientific fact has been as thoroughly examined as global warming being caused by greenhouse gases or the link between HIV and AIDS, then no contrary position can claim much intellectual or scholarly respectability because it is so overwhelmingly at odds with the evidence. That’s why politicians such as Republican Congressman Lamar Smith need to accuse the NOAA of having “altered the [climate] data to get the results they needed to advance this administration’s extreme climate change agenda”. If the evidence is against you, then it has to be manipulated by mysterious forces in pursuit of a nefarious agenda. This is like saying that you shouldn’t cross the road by just looking because the several dozen optometrists who have independently attested to your 20/20 vision have manipulated the results because … World Government! Taxation! … and therefore you’d better stand on your head blindfolded with tinfoil. So do the people who disseminate misinformation about climate actually believe what they are saying? The question can be answered by considering the stock market. Investors decide on which stock to buy based on their best estimates of a company’s future potential. In other words, investors place an educated bet on a company’s future based on their constant reading of odds that are determined by myriad factors. Investors put their money where their beliefs are. Likewise, climate scientists put their money where their knowledge is: physicist Mark Boslough recently offered a $25,000 bet on future temperature increases. It has not been taken up. Nobel laureate Brian Schmidt similarly offered a bet to an Australian “skeptic” on climate change. It was not taken up. People who deny climate science do not put their money where their mouth is. And when they very occasionally do, they lose. This is not altogether surprising: in a recent peer-reviewed paper, with James Risbey as first author, we showed that wagering on global surface warming would have won a bet every year since 1970. We therefore suggested that denial may be “… largely posturing on the part of the contrarians. Bets against greenhouse warming are largely hopeless now and that is widely understood.” So the cherry-picking and conspiracy-theorising will continue while it is politically opportune, but the people behind it won’t put their money where their mouth is. They probably know better. Now read: The last time Earth was this hot hippos lived in Britain (that’s 130,000 years ago) "

The Peru Reports site here wrote that extreme cold killed 21 people, among them 15 children in Peru (emphasis added):
Peru’s government is rushing to provide relief in the southern state of Puno, where a harsh winter has killed 21 people.
After an avalanche buried six miners in San Antonio de Putina province last week, 15 children under five years old have since died from acute respiratory infections and pneumonia in an unusually harsh winter.”
Temperatures plummeted to -20°C and the effected region was hit heavy snow the report writes.
The winter was so severe that by mid July health officials had seen 39,000 cases of acute respiratory infections among citizens. But not only humans had to endure extreme suffering from the harsh winter, the Peru Reports also writes:

Over 171,000 alpacas have died from hypothermia, diarrhea, pneumonia and starvation. The animals feed on grass, which is frozen and covered in snow.
The German language Latina Presse here called the cold wave and the death a tragedy.
In 2013 Approximately 250,000 alpacas died “as a result of the worst snowfall” Peru had seen in a decade and the “unexpectedly intense blast of winter weather”. Read here.
The Nature World News wrote in 2013:
In Bolivia’s capital, La Paz, temperatures were 8 or 9 degrees Celsius below average, Al Jazeera reported, adding that the Atacama Desert in Chile, often regarded as one of the driest places on Earth, saw the heaviest snowfall the region has seen in 30 years.”
For a supposedly overheated planet, we sure have been seeing lots of reports of “unusual cold” coming from all over the world.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnline daily Die Welt here reports on how German consumers are being forced to pay huge sums of money to wind park and solar plant operators who are ordered to stop feeding electricity into the grid, but yet get paid anyway!
As volatile green electricity increasingly gets fed into an ever more unstable German power grid, wind parks and solar energy producers are being asked ever more frequently to switch off their plants to prevent grid overloads. Yet, they still receive money for the power they would have produced. It’s one of the nutty peculiarities of Germany’s wacky green energy feed-in act.
Die Welt calls this never-produced power “phantom electricity”. But it is costing consumers real cash.
One reason wind parks are unable to feed into the power grid at times is because the transmission lines needed to carry away the excess power are too inadequate to handle the frequent overloads, or they just don’t exist. Die Welt reports:
Because power lines are missing, wind parks have to be switched off more and more often. Yet wind entrepreneurs get paid for not producing. The costs for this are rising rapidly.”
Making money (and doing so with absolutely no risk) has never been easier!
Naturally this is causing electricity bills for German consumers to jump yet again. Die Welt reports that just the green electricity feed-in surcharge levied on consumers will reach “a record value of 6.35 cents per kilowatt-hour” next year. Now consumers will also have to pay even more money for power that never gets produced.
Already this year it is expected that a quarter billion euros will be added to electricity bills for the green kilowatt-hours which were never produced.”
This, Die Welt writes, is based on calculations by the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur). The reason the estimated 1580 gigawatt-hours of electricity were never produced (but still paid for): “…because there was not enough powerline capacity to deliver the power to consumers.”

Consequently: green power producers and investors get off scot-free; consumers get the shaft.
The quarter-billion-euro amount is three times higher than the 82.6 million euros from a year earlier.
Die Welt reports that this warped market situation will only worsen in the future. As more volatile wind and solar energy come online, Germany tries to unload the excess power from it’s overloaded grid by dumping it into neighboring foreign markets such as in Poland or the Czech Republic, sometimes even at negative prices.
However these eastern neighbors are refusing to allow all the excess electricity to flood into their national grids unhindered. Die Welt reports: “Beginning next year Poland and the Czech Republic want to prevent German green power from coming into neighboring countries by employing power blockers at their borders, so-called phase shifters.”
So, on windy and sunny days, excess German green power will have no place to go, and thus this will necessitate the shutting down of even more wind parks and solar plants. That means the tab for the never-produced (phantom) electricity will continue it’s upward spiral. The result: even more money flooding up from the poor to the coffers of the rich.
No wonder the German model has become an export hit to countries with greedy green energy developers and investors! Making money has never been easier.
Die Welt summarizes:
Thus in the foreseeable future the German domestic power grid will be so massively loaded that there will be hardly any alternative to more frequent shutdowns of expensive wind and solar parks in Germany.”
That means more costs for consumers – for nothing in return.

"Tonight, Channel 4 will host the first ever election debate on the climate crisis. All of the major party leaders have confirmed their attendance, save for Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage. The Brexit party doesn’t have a climate platform, so that squares, but Johnson would be a curious absence. The Conservative government recently passed a commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050; the party’s manifesto repeats that pledge, and includes new spending for environment and climate policies. Until now, the Tories haven’t seemed afraid to talk climate. This distinguishes them from other rightwing parties in the English-speaking world. The US and Australia especially seem doomed to forever re-fight the climate denial battles of the mid-00s – witness Donald Trump’s tweets about cold weather contradicting “global warming”, or the now Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, triumphantly brandishing a chunk of coal in parliament.  But in the UK, since they overwhelmingly supported the 2008 Climate Change Act, the Tories seem to have come around and fully accepted the science. No one in the party openly questions the link between carbon emissions and warming, or the need for action. Its once-vocal science denier fringe has been almost entirely silenced, or, like former minister Ann Widdecombe, decamped to the Brexit party. But it should be clear to us now that it is possible for leaders to accept the scientific consensus, attend the meetings, meet the activists, nod gravely, sign the pledges and then effectively do nothing. It’s time to ask whether this approach is really a marked improvement on denying the climate crisis altogether. There is a term currently floating around activist circles, “new denialism”. This is attached to ways of thinking that acknowledge the reality of climate change, but don’t lead to what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change calls the “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society” needed to avoid 1.5C warming. New denialism accepts the basic atmospheric science, but rejects the immense volume of further scientific work suggesting that we can change things – either because it would be too disruptive to our current way of life, or to the way we’ve organised our economy. It can seem like a vague category: it encompasses over-cautious incremental policies and tepid market-based solutions; insistence that some not-yet-existing technology will emerge to wipe out our carbon debts; and even arguments that we’re too far gone, and should focus our efforts on adaptation. These all acknowledge the problem, but reject the solutions that scientists insist on: immediate, radical reductions in carbon emissions. This seems markedly less evil than the cartoon-villain propaganda of climate science deniers. And at close range it is. But any future moral accounting of the climate crisis is unlikely to distinguish bad faith from good intentions; rather it will be weighed in megatonnes of carbon, which hit another all-time high this year. As the academics Philip Mirowski, Jeremy Walker and Antoinette Abboud noted in 2013, the thinktanks behind climate denial never thought they would win the war of ideas with academic science – they simply wanted to stall for as long as they could anything that would threaten the interests of the fossil fuel industry. Seen this way, new denialism isn’t anti-science specifically – it’s a reactionary project, which seeks to uphold or reassert the status quo. And if denialism is about stopping action, then anything that needlessly obstructs action is denial. Ultimately, then, there’s no fundamental difference between outright denialism and new denialism. New denialism is visible in the gaps between words and actions: oil companies claiming to decarbonise while approving enough fossil fuel production to shoot us well past 2C; governments promising emission reductions with no credible plan to do so. Two weeks ago the UN called the majority of existing climate policies “totally inadequate”. The truth is, the Tories are fine with that. Johnson won’t talk climate today because Labour and the Liberal Democrats have unveiled transformative multi-billion pound infrastructure programs and regulatory measures that would actually address the climate crisis, while the Conservative manifesto commits more spending to potholes than to electric vehicles. It’s the same bait and switch that has kept climate action stalled for decades: promise, then don’t deliver. Johnson’s purported commitment to a 2050 target won’t stand up to scrutiny from the public, or from the other parties – but it’s still there in the manifesto, a grand signpost pointing absolutely nowhere. The Tories have got credit over the years for their rhetoric on climate – from supporting the Climate Change Act to David Cameron’s “greenest government ever”. The reality has been less impressive: they have failed to enact any major policy and outright killed promising programmes such as zero carbon homes. And yet, they’ve avoided major condemnation as long as discussions inched along, committing to new targets without plans to achieve them, the rhetorical consensus intact. The other parties have broken that, thankfully, by promising bold action that acknowledge the true demands of the crisis. We say a person who won’t accept tough realities is in denial. We shouldn’t be scared to extend that label to Johnson and his party. • Stephen Buranyi is a writer in London"

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Europe, especially Germany, diesel engines are quite popular. The oil-burning combustion motors get far better fuel mileage and the price of fuel in the country is some 20% cheaper than gasoline – thanks to lower taxes.
With fuel prices today at the lowest level they’ve been in quite some time, German motorists are once again enjoying the low-cost motoring and are thus more inclined to take extra trips with dem Auto. Lately the price of diesel fuel has even dipped below 1 euro per liter (about $4.30 a US gallon) – in heavily taxed Europe a real bargain compared to a just a few years ago.
But not everyone is happy about the low fuel prices. Yesterday Spiegel opined on the falling diesel prices, complaining that “the low-cost fuel is no reason to celebrate“, warning that “for the low cost diesel, we are going to pay a heavy price“. This is typical of the German media. As soon as something good happens, they have to find a way to rain all over it.
Why does Spiegel think this is going to cost a “heavy price”? The center-left flagship weekly thinks the extra driving that Germans will do as a result of the low prices is going to cause more emissions of dangerous “cancer-causing” fine particles and nitrous oxide, which in turn of course will cost “human lives”.
Ridiculously Spiegel uses smog-choked China as an example as to why Germans are going to die from higher emissions. In reality, German smog is only a small fraction of a small fraction of Chinese smog, and so Germans aren’t at all concerned about a few particles.
Those in favor of cheap diesel outnumber those against it by a margin of 2 – 1!

For now Germans are quite content with the latest diesel fuel price trend, just as an online poll of its readers that accompanies the story now shows. So far as of 8:20 p.m. CET, some 95,000 readers have answered their one-question survey question:
Diesel is cheaper than it’s been in a long time. What’s your opinion on this?
The result: Over 60% say that this is good news for motorists or that the fuel should be even cheaper.
Less than one third say diesel fuel should be more expensive. This is hardly good news for the environmental activists.
Overall even green-conscious Germans prefer low cost fossil-fuel diesel by a margin of 2 to 1! Of course this is not a scientific survey. Yet the results show that people are generally fine with the low fuel prices. Electric cars face yet another obstacle.

"Fossil fuel lobbyists are trying to water down planned EU rules to stop “investment greenwashing’ by setting science-based criteria for any investment which lays claim to being environmentally sustainable. A report from lobbyist watchdog InfluenceMap has found that although some investors support the “green labelling” rules, 98% of Europe’s 50 largest investors are members of lobby groups trying to weaken the proposals. The new “green taxonomy” law would enable the EU to set science-based criteria for what kind of investments can be marketed as “environmentally sustainable”. The report found that lobbyists for the oil and gas sector including Eurogas, the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), and FuelsEurope have pushed for weaker criteria which would classify gas projects as “green”. Burning gas to generate electricity has roughly half the carbon intensity as burning coal, but still emits potent greenhouse gases which are proven to accelerate the climate crisis. FuelsEurope has argued that “no threshold should be put on the amount of fossil fuels used” and IOGP has suggested to EU lawmakers that “any investments in gas related projects should be considered as sustainable”. Ed Collins, the report’s lead author, said “Our research shows how vested interests have risked moving the critical EU taxonomy process away from being science-driven and focused on real-world impacts to one which supports narrow vested interests and the status quo in finance and sustainability.” The findings from InfluenceMap follow a report commissioned by a coalition of green groups earlier this year which found that the five biggest oil and gas companies, and their industry groups, spent at least €251m (£217m) lobbying the European Union over climate policies since 2010. The scale of the fossil fuel industry’s lobbying activities triggered calls from 200 organisations to demand a “firewall” around democratic politics to protect it from the influence of the fossil fuel industry.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI just got back to Germany earlier today after spending 2 weeks out in the states. The overnight transatlantic flights after such a period always give me major jetlag. I’m not the type that sleeps on planes and I don’t cope well at all with the time shifts.
Lots of photos here to tell you what I’m feeling right now. I’m struggling just to keep awake, which I plan to do until 9 pm. I have to keep moving outside in the fresh air. If I sit down for even just a couple of minutes, the exhaustion floods in.
So, no blogging today. Be back tomorrow!

Share this...FacebookTwitterIt’s a good time to take a look at how global sea ice is doing at both poles. We were told over and over that the poles are the canary in the coal mine for global warming.
If the sea ice melt trend accelerated, we were warned, then the planet was warming rapidly and societies would be wise to prepare quickly for long-term sea level rise.
But nothing has happened at the poles so far.
Like everything related to climate and weather, there’s a lot of volatility built into the infinitely complex system, and so short term changes should not be viewed hysterically.
It is important to keep the focus on the long term and to keep a rational head. When that is done, then we quickly see that there is nothing to worry about and that all the climate indicators are all well within the normal range of natural variability.
The following chart shows Arctic sea ice coverage anomaly from the mean since satellite measurements began in 1978:

The above chart, from arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere, shows that the Arctic sea ice was in fact quite stable from 1979 to 2002, trending downward only slightly. Then from 2002 to 2007, a period of only 5 years, the sea ice saw almost all of its melting. Over the past 10 years, however, the Arctic sea ice has been stable, even growing some over the past 6 years.
Indeed a number of scientists are projecting the Arctic sea ice to recover as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) enters its negative mode of its typical 50-60 year cycle.
It needs to be pointed out that 35 years is a short period when attempting to derive long term sea ice trends. Let us recall it is known that the Arctic sea ice coverage moves in multidecadal cycles, impacted heavily by natural oceanic cycles.
In the 1950s photos of an ice-free north pole are famous. Old newspaper clippings from the early 20th century quoted scientists who reported “dramatic melting” in the Arctic.

Antarctic accelerating sea ice growth trend
The South Pole has been a real embarrassment for the global warming alarmists who earlier predicted a meltdown. That too has not happened. Instead the Antarctic trend has gone in the totally opposite direction:

Source: arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere
The above chart shows that Antarctic sea ice cover has in fact been accelerating upwards. Over the past several months the sea ice has fallen from its record high levels and is now dead normal – for the first time in more than 3 years!
Looking at both north and south polar sea ice combined, using data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center, we see absolutely nothing to worry about:

Everything is completely normal and there is no reason to let yourself go into fits of hysteria.

"It traps carbon in the ground for centuries, boosts plant growth, provides a sustainable heat source and could even reduce methane emissions from cows. Biochar may not be a silver bullet to combating the climate emergency, but it certainly ticks a lot of boxes. A form of charcoal created via a special chemical process, biochar is not much to look at, resembling the aftermath of a particularly good barbecue. But it is already heating homes in Stockholm, feeding cows in Lincolnshire, and nourishing trees near Loch Ness. “When you look at the range of benefits it has, it is quite phenomenal,” says Marc Redmile-Gordon, senior scientist for soil and climate change at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). While stressing that biochar is only part of the solution, he adds: “If we stop burning fossil fuels tomorrow, we’ll still have a lot of carbon dioxide removal to be doing, and this is one of the most effective ways we can achieve that.” Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame? This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come. Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theguardian.com Following biochar’s recognition in the IPCC 2018 report, earlier this year Redmile-Gordon launched the society’s first trials to see how the material could improve plant growth. He estimates planting 10-20kg of biochar in your garden could offset the carbon from a five-mile return commute in a car for a month. Biochar is a form of charcoal produced when organic matter – for example wood, leaves or dead plants – is heated at high temperatures with little or no oxygen in a process called pyrolysis. The normal burning or decomposition of these materials would release large amounts of methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Instead, creating biochar traps this carbon in solid form for centuries; it becomes a carbon sink that can be buried underground. This is nothing new – in Stockholm they have already developed technology to trap the heat generated in the process and put it to use, so now the focus is on what benefits biochar can bring once it is in the ground. Although results vary depending on the type of biochar and soil used, Redmile-Gordon says this stuff can “alleviate some of the stresses that come from climate change”. Biochar is full of xylem vessels and capillaries – channels that “can carry nutrients, air, water and house the biology that make for a healthy soil ecosystem”, he says. This means that in waterlogged clay soil it can reduce and redistribute water content, whereas in sandy soil affected by drought it can increase water-hold potential. While scientific research has established the benefits of biochar in theory, deploying it in a way that makes a real difference is a challenge. One of its most obvious uses is in tree planting, which is poised to become a major activity in the UK over the coming years. The Conservatives have pledged to plant 30m trees a year, the Liberal Democrats have promised 60m a year, while Labour’s manifesto pledges an ambitious tree-planting programme. “They bandy around these big numbers, but will they actually talk about the survival rates?” asks James MacPhail, commercial director of Carbon Gold, which sells biochar products for use in soil everywhere, from people’s back gardens to Ascot racecourse. Up to 80% of trees planted along the HS2 rail route died after last summer’s drought. For MacPhail, this suggests not enough is being done to ensure tree growth: “If you plant 1m trees, great, but if 800,000 die, was it really worth it? If you can just do one thing to guarantee the survival of a tree going in the ground then maybe trees can save the planet.” Research suggests biochar could be just the thing. Dr Saran Sohi leads the UK Biochar Research Centre in Edinburgh which is injecting biochar made from forestry residue such as bark around tree roots as part of a tree-planting project near Loch Ness. “It really does seem to offer some quite marked benefits in terms of tree health, early stage growth and nutrient management,” says Sohi. “Turning this particular part of the tree into biochar allows the nutrients to be returned to the forest sites in the process of replanting.” Other projects are making strides in integrating biochar into farming, too. Richard Copley is part of the Innovative Farmers network, and received funding to trial feeding biochar to some of his cows this year. As both a farmer and a tree surgeon, Copley was keen to use the waste from his tree felling in a useful way, and he noticed the positive effects of biochar on his animals immediately. Biochar is alkaline, so it balances the highly acidic diet of cows. Evidence suggests it is beneficial for microbial activity – like putting a probiotic into your stomach, according to Copley. Trials elsewhere have suggested biochar could reduce methane emissions, something Copley hopes can be explored later, as well as trialling the material on other animals such as chicken and sheep. Meanwhile, Donna Udall, a researcher from Coventry University, is exploring whether manure from the biochar-fed cows is more effective as a fertiliser than biochar by itself. In some instances biochar can reduce crop yield by absorbing the nutrients needed by the plants – biochar as part of manure could be the solution. While academics and researchers are optimistic about the benefits of biochar, they are not blind to the risks either. “If we’re wrong, and we spread hundreds of thousands of tonnes of charcoal over the UK, we can’t get it back out of the ground. We’ve got to be right. The stakes are really high,” says Udall. Sohi adds: “This makes the government a bit anxious, which is why I think starting slowly and getting comfortable with the technology first is probably a good idea.” Not only that, but there are also practical problems with trying to acquire the vast amounts of biochar needed to make a real impact. Udall says: “In order to scale up the technology, you’d have to plant woods everywhere, and obviously you can understand the impact that would have on the land that we need to grow crops.” Only when farmers, food producers and other industries start putting their biomass waste through a pyrolysis process as standard would there be enough biochar to roll it out on a wide scale, says Udall. But eventually biochar could be made from green waste in urban areas – everything right down to the banana skin lying on your desk, she adds. The key is working out how the source material affects the resulting biochar after pyrolysis, something which still needs substantial investigation. But with some estimates suggesting biochar could offset 1bn tonnes of carbon a year, it’s easy to see why people are getting excited about it. • This article was amended on 30 November to make clear that Marc Redmile-Gordon emphasised that biochar has the potential to alleviate some, but not all, of the stresses of climate change"
"Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions have flatlined due to the effects of the drought, which has caused a large drop in carbon dioxide from the agriculture sector. The government’s quarterly greenhouse data for the year to June 2019, published on Friday, shows Australia’s emissions fell by 0.1% on the previous year – equivalent to 0.4m tonnes of carbon dioxide. Previous government reports showed emissions had risen year-on-year since 2015. The latest report uses newly adjusted numbers for some sectors and instead suggests emissions have increased in some years, slightly dropped in others, but mostly been flat since the abolition of the carbon price scheme in 2014. The small drop is the result of declining emissions from the agriculture and electricity sectors, which fell by 5.9% and 1.2% respectively. Emissions from transport decreased by 0.5%. But these decreases have been almost entirely offset by large increases from other parts of the economy. Emissions from stationary energy, including manufacturing, construction and commercial sectors, rose by 3.6% and fugitive emissions are up by 4.4%. Both increases are largely due to the growth in the liquified natural gas (LNG) industry. The sharp drop in emissions from agriculture shows the effect of widespread drought in NSW and Queensland and the impact of the Queensland floods in February. Both have led to significant drops in the amount of cattle on properties. Tim Baxter, a senior climate solutions researcher at the Climate Council, said there were “two stories” beneath the data. “Farmers are suffering. That’s part of the drop,” he said. “The other part of the drop is renewables deployment as a result of a whole bunch of projects coming online for the end of the renewable energy target. “The drought is not something to celebrate, nor is the renewables sector at the moment which is facing a fairly big slump in investment.” Baxter said the growth in the LNG sector was almost enough on its own to offset the fall in agricultural emissions and “the good work of the renewables sector”. “This is a blip in our emissions that isn’t long for this world [due to] plans we have for gas in this country. It will go back up,” he said. The emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, said the data emissions from electricity had fallen for the third consecutive year. He said emissions from producing Australia’s exports had increased as a share of total emissions from 30.1% to 37.5% over the past five years, largely due to the growth of the LNG industry. Labor’s climate spokesman, Mark Butler, said the accounts showed that, on a seasonally adjusted and weather normalised basis, emissions continued to rise. Adam Bandt, the Greens’ climate spokesman, said drought was “not an acceptable pollution reduction strategy”. “The sad irony in these figures is that this small drop in pollution is itself due to climate inaction,” he said. The decline in emissions from electricity was confirmed by the The Australia Institute’s monthly national energy emissions audit, which found pollution from the national grid continues to decline due to sharp decrease in coal-fired power. Hugh Saddler, an energy expert who compiles the report for the institute, said Australia’s coal fleet was ageing, and increasingly requiring “sick leave” for repairs. “Power stations like Loy Yang A in Victoria are continually out of action,” he said. Annual generation from coal peaked in January 2009. Since then, black coal generation has fallen 9%, brown coal electricity slumped by 41% and gas-fired power risen by 3%. The decline in coal has been almost entirely replaced by an increase in wind power, rooftop solar panels, large-scale solar farms and hydro electricity. Richie Merzian, the Australia Institute’s climate and energy program director, said with the Bureau of Meteorology warning of a hot summer it was likely the coal fleet would struggle to provide reliable generation. The latest emissions data was released ahead of Taylor’s scheduled trip to United Nations climate talks in Madrid, where Australia is expected to come under pressure over a lack of policy to curb emissions. Several analyses have found Australia is not on track to meet its 2030 target of a 26-28% emissions cut below 2005 levels. The Morrison government has also drawn criticism from other nations for planning to use what are known as carryover credits from the Kyoto Protocol, which some countries consider a loophole to avoid actual reductions. Australia is the only country proposing to use the carryover credits to help meet its Paris target. The climate talks start on Monday and run for two weeks, with ministers mostly attending the second week. Labor has said it will deny Taylor a pair to attend an International Energy Agency conference in Paris next week, on the way to the climate summit, arguing it is inappropriate that he leave parliament while there is a live police investigation into the origins of a doctored document the minister used to attack the lord mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online French L’Express here reports how climate science skepticism is gaining momentum in France: “COP 21: the climate skeptics are heating up the Web.”
L’Express writes that the recent rise in French skepticism has been especially fuelled by former France 2 television meteorologist Philippe Verdier. who was sacked weeks ago by France 2 television for challenging global warming science and the “ultra–politicized the IPCC scientists (1)” in his recently released book. 
According to L’Express, Verdier has become a sort of a “martyr of freedom of expression” who echos the “Je suis Charlie” response in the wake of the radical Islamist terrorist attack on free speech newspaper Charlie Hebdo earlier this year.
Verdier is perceived as the latest high-profile newcomer to the French climate skepticism scene, following in the footsteps of renowned skeptic like Claude Allègre and Vincent Courtillot. 
The French daily writes that there has been more talk about Philippe Verdier in the French gazettes than there is of the regular climate scientists. L’Express describes the success of Verdier’s online petition for his reinstatement at France 2, which saw some 20,000 signatures.
L’Express sees climate skepticism as a sign of a re-awakening neo-liberalism and independent thinking, fueled by American think tanks like the Heartland or Marshall Institute, and now helped along by the newly minted French “comité d’organisation du Collectif des climatoréalistes” (Organizing Committee of the Committee for the Organization of the Collective of Climate Realists) started by Jean-Pierre Bardinet just weeks ago. 
It’s becoming clear that the skeptics, who have been dismissed repeatedly by mainstream media over the past two decades, have been a far more formidable force than the climate warming alarmists dare to admit. Frustration among the alarmists is reaching new high levels, and it is showing.
L’Express quotes Le Monde science journalist Stéphane Foucart, who recently opined on climate skeptics, who he writes are made up of “a small network of people who deny the reality of the current global warming or its anthropogenic origin“:
In 1979 in an editorial the New York Times predicted the dangers of global warming. It was still possible to take action. Today we are driving into a wall while honking. The climate skeptics have caused us to lose time we will never be able get back.”
Failure in Paris would indeed be a massive, unrecoverable blow to the warmist agenda, and would certainly be crippled if not totally disabled by it. Already the sharp tones tell us there’s a sense of worry spreading across the French capital.

"Scotland has become the first part of the UK to stop burning coal to supply electricity following the closure of Longannet, its largest power station, on March 24. It is a sign of the times, with the rest of the UK’s coal-fired power stations on death row after energy secretary Amber Rudd announced late last year that they will all be forced to close by 2025.  For many reasons, it is hard to mourn the demise of coal-fired power. Around 12,000 miners are killed around the world each year, most of them digging for coal; abandoned mines cause widespread water pollution; and coal-fired plants pollute the air with the likes of nitrogen and sulphur compounds, as well as the highest greenhouse-gas emissions of any major source of energy generation. In the absence of carbon capture and storage, a technology which would be ready more quickly if the government backed it properly, plant closure may therefore seem sensible – even while we should help those that lose their jobs and regret the loss of skills from the workforce. That would be all there was to say were it not for a few harsh realities of electricity supply. There are two reasons why coal-fired power plants have survived so long. Coal is cheap; only since the US shale-gas boom has it been consistently beaten on price. And coal-fired plants are particularly suited to providing power on demand at short notice, as well as providing crucial stabilisation services for frequency and voltage across the grid.   If we are unable to dispatch electricity on demand, we must expect blackouts. To do away with coal-fired power before alternatives are available is bold, to say the least. Gas-fired plants can play the same role, of course, but we have not been building them in the UK in recent decades. And the economics for doing so have been made very difficult by the capacity-auctions system that helps to fund them, which has also seen many existing plants mothballed. As for nuclear power, it is low-carbon but provides electricity at a constant rate and therefore can’t be increased to track demand. Besides, the ongoing fiasco over Hinkley C – and by extension nuclear new-build in general – hardly makes it look a great contributor to energy security in the foreseeable future.  Among the renewable sources, the only one that offers equivalent dispatchable power is biomass combustion – burning mainly wood – but it also entails air-quality challenges and its sustainability is debatable. Hydropower is seasonally limited, while wind and solar are incapable of dispatchable output. The consequences are not just for the future, either – to compensate for the reduced coal-fired and gas-fired power, National Grid has been quietly allowing energy companies to set up “diesel farms” of temporary generators in England to provide extra power in peak, even though it’s more damaging than coal.  But can’t we just store renewable energy, whenever it is generated, and dispatch it at times of high demand? Let’s be clear: we have the technology – it’s the affordability and scale that are challenging. Of the myriad potential storage technologies, none are as yet close to being able to store electricity at comparable scale and cost to our only grid-level storage technology: pumped-storage hydropower.   But pumped storage can only do so much. Let’s assume the UK could muster sufficient wind power to meet one third of our typical daily electricity consumption (40 GW to 45 GW). In the absence of dispatchable power on demand, to offset the kind of three-day calm period that is common during spells of high pressure in winter, we would need to be able to store around 1,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of power. Yet pumped storage hydropower in the UK only totals 30 GWh, from four stations.  If we are going to manage without Longannet and all the other gas-fired and coal-fired power stations, we would need at least 970 GWh of storage – more than a hundred pumped hydropower stations of comparable size to those we already have. This would be unlikely to cost less than £100 billion. And do we even have 100 plus upland catchments we’d be happy to impound and manage for this purpose? Even if most of the UK uplands were not (rightly) zealously protected conservation areas, it seems implausible that the UK could find sufficient sites.  Add the important caveat that you lose energy sending it back and forth to a storage facility, between 10% and 35% depending on the technology. This means that relying on renewables and increased storage means you would need substantially more total generating capacity than at present.   So far we have only talked about power quantity, whereas power quality is also crucial. To keep voltage within prescribed bounds requires “reactive” (or “wattless”) power. Coal-fired power-stations have long been the mainstay of this activity – not least in Scotland. It has to be done regionally, so you can’t make up for this with coal power from elsewhere. Wind turbines cannot provide reactive power control. Since nuclear is being phased out in Scotland, gas-fired power is again the only alternative.  So as we close plants such as Longannet, we can expect serious problems with voltage control. This bodes ill for the electrical appliances and devices on which we all increasingly rely. With the closure of Longannet, Scotland thus becomes the first area of the UK to take a serious gamble with reactive power. It will take not just good management but a serious amount of good luck for the fossil-fuel funeral wake not to be spoiled by flickering or failure of the lights.  In short, we may be heading into dangerous territory. The UK needs to get a strategy together for building new gas-fired or coal-fired power, fitted with carbon capture and storage technology, before the situation deteriorates any further."
"In the past week you’ve probably eaten crops that wouldn’t exist in nature, or that have evolved extra genes to reach freakish sizes. You’ve probably eaten “cloned” food and you may have even eaten plants whose ancestors were once deliberately blasted with radiation. And you could have bought all this without leaving the “organic” section of your local supermarket. Anti-GM dogma is obscuring the real debate over what level of genetic manipulation society deems acceptable. Genetically-modified food is often regarded as something you’re either for or against, with no real middle ground.  Yet it is misleading to consider GM technology a binary decision, and blanket bans like those in many European countries are only likely to further stifle debate. After all, very little of our food is truly “natural” and even the most basic crops are the result of some form of human manipulation.  Between organic foods and tobacco engineered to glow in the dark lie a broad spectrum of “modifications” worthy of consideration. All of these different technologies are sometimes lumped together under “GM”. But where would you draw the line? Think of carrots, corn or watermelons – all foods you might eat without much consideration. Yet when compared to their wild ancestors, even the “organic” varieties are almost unrecognisable.  Domestication generally involves selecting for beneficial traits, such as high yield. Over time, many generations of selection can substantially alter a plant’s genetic makeup. Man-made selection is capable of generating forms that are extremely unlikely to occur in nature. Unknowing selection by our ancestors also involved a genetic process we only discovered relatively recently. Whereas humans have half a set of chromosomes (structures that package and organise your genetic information) from each parent, some organisms can have two or more complete duplicate sets of chromosomes. This “polyploidy” is widespread in plants and often results in exaggerated traits such as fruit size, thought to be the result of multiple gene copies. Without realising, many crops have been unintentionally bred to a higher level of ploidy (entirely naturally) as things like large fruit or vigorous growth are often desirable. Ginger and apples are triploid for example, while potatoes and cabbage are tetraploid. Some strawberry varieties are even octoploid, meaning they have eight sets of chromosomes compared to just two in humans. It’s a word that tends to conjure up some discomfort – no one really wants to eat “cloned” food. Yet asexual reproduction is the core strategy for many plants in nature, and farmers have utilised it for centuries to perfect their crops. Once a plant with desirable characteristics is found – a particularly tasty and durable banana, for instance – cloning allows us to grow identical replicates. This could be entirely natural with a cutting or runner, or artificially-induced with plant hormones. Domestic bananas have long since lost the seeds that allowed their wild ancestors to reproduce – if you eat a banana today, you’re eating a clone. Selection – both human and natural – operates on genetic variation within a species. If a trait or characteristic never occurs, then it cannot be selected for. In order to generate greater variation for conventional breeding, scientists in the 1920s began to expose seeds to chemicals or radiation.  Unlike more modern GM technologies, this “mutational breeding” is largely untargeted and generates mutations at random. Most will be useless, but some will be desirable. More than 1,800 cultivars of crop and ornamental plants including varieties of wheat, rice, cotton and peanuts have been developed and released in more than 50 countries. Mutational breeding is credited for spurring the “green revolution” in the 20th century. Many common foods such as red grapefruits and varieties of pasta wheat are a result of this approach and, surprisingly, these can still be sold as certified “organic”. GM technology doesn’t have to involve any direct manipulation of plants or species. It can be instead used to screen for traits such as disease susceptibility or to identify which “natural” cross is likely to produce the greatest yield or best outcome. Genetic technology has allowed researchers to identify in advance which ash trees are likely to be susceptible to ash dieback disease, for instance. Future forests could be grown from these resistant trees. We might call this “genomics-informed” human selection. This is what most people mean when they refer to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) – genes being artificially inserted into a different plant to improve yield, tolerance to heat or drought, to produce better drugs or even to add a vitamin. Under conventional breeding, such changes might take decades. Added genes provide a shortcut. Cisgenic simply means the gene inserted (or moved, or duplicated) comes from the same or a very closely related species. Inserting genes from unrelated species (transgenic) is substantially more challenging – this is the only technique in our spectrum of GM technology that can produce an organism that could not occur naturally. Yet the case for it might still be compelling. Since the 1990s several crops have been engineered with a gene from the soil bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis. This bacteria gives “Bt corn” and other engineered crops resistance to certain pests, and acts as an appealing alternative to pesticide use.  This technology remains the most controversial as there are concerns that resistance genes could “escape” and jump to other species, or be unfit for human consumption. While unlikely – many fail safe approaches are designed to prevent this – it is of course possible.  All of these methods continue to be used. Even transgenic crops are now widely cultivated around the world, and have been for more than a decade. They are closely scrutinised and rightly so, but the promise of this technology means that it surely deserves improved scientific literacy among the public if it is to reach it’s full potential.  And let’s be clear, with global population set to hit nine billion by 2050 and the increasingly greater strain on the environment, GMOs have the potential to improve health, increase yields and reduce our impact. However uncomfortable they might make us, they deserve a sensible and informed debate."

Share this...FacebookTwitterRudolf Kipp of the Science Skeptical site has a post on the latest climate predictions of Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, the Director of the alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). The institute is influential and is famous for being staffed with scientists who are homogenously alarmist and at times zealously intolerant of dissenting views.
Kipp refers to an article appearing at the NTV German public television website titled: “Man as a geological force – The next ice age is no longer coming.”
The NTV article writes that large parts of the earth are geologically scheduled to be covered by ice sheets in 60,000 years but that “man has succeeded in preventing this ice age. Already.” This, the NTV reports, was recently said by Schellnhuber at the opening of the climate conference in Munich.
NTV writes:
The next ice age won’t be taking place believes renowned climate scientist Hans Joachim Schellnhuber. The reason is man-caused global warming. Without the influence of man the next episode of ice sheets covering large parts of the earth would happen in about 60,000 years according to the laws of cosmic mechanics, said Schellnhuber…”
Man “now able to suppress ice ages”
Schellnhuber said that the 500 billion tonnes of CO2 emitted by man into the atmosphere was “enough to prevent the onset of the next cold period.” Schellnhuber added, “Man has already become a powerful geological force that is even able to suppress ice ages.”
“As certain as the amen in Church”
The Potsdam Professor does not shy away from mixing religious undertones to underscore his 60,000 year global visions. He claims, according to NTV, that unless we act politically and quickly, a 2°C warming will be surpassed soon and the earth will become beset by cataclysmic climate events. The NTV quotes Schellnhuber:

The sea level over the long-term would rise an estimated six meters and many ecosystems, such as the coral reefs, would be destroyed . ‘That is as certain as the Amen in Church.'”
Can chaotic systems be forecast 60,000 years out?
Is Professor Schellnhuber a prophet?
So just how should we judge Professor Schellnhuber and his most recent cataclysmic visions? Does science really have the ability to forecast natural events 1000 years ahead, let alone 60,000? Is there a single scientist out there who claims to have the profound knowledge needed to predict how a chaotic system, one involving thousands of random variables, will be in 60,000 years time? The answer of course is no. Already we see that the climate models couldn’t even get the first 20 years right! How can they be expected to get the next 59,980 years correct?
The only other explanation left to explain the visions is that Professor Schellnhuber is in fact a prophet. He did, after all, have an audience with the Pope and perhaps Mr. Schellnhuber shared his God-communicated visions to His Holiness himself. Now, with the Pope’s blessings, Schellnhuber has returned to tell us that our sins of today are in fact denying life to the creatures that are supposed to inhabit the ice sheets of the next ice ages. Indeed he claims to have seen profound visions of future worlds melting away.
“Daring”
According to NTV, climate scientist Hans von Storch was asked to comment on Schellnhuber’s 60,000-year visions. NTV writes that his reaction was that “he views statements concerning time frames involving 60,000 years as daring“.
Von Storch obviously believes Schellnhuber neither has the scientific knowledge to make 60,000 year predictions, nor that he is a prophet bearing Visions of God.
It is truly incredible that today such wildly speculative visions are being marketed as valid scientific products, and are now being (mis)used as weapons of fear with the aim of ramming through an oppressive authoritarian climate policy. Recall that people who dare challenge this kind of extreme nonsense are today being threatened with legal prosecution! Where do we find ourselves when challenging obvious nonsense is now almost a crime?
It is truly astonishing that this has gotten this far. We should be worried – very worried. (๑ʘ∆ʘ๑)

"The other day my kids came home from school all excited to tell me they had been watching Tim Peake, the astronaut set to make Britain’s first spacewalk. I was surprised how much excitement this had caused in my kids, but then one of my earliest memories is sitting with my father watching Neil Armstrong step on the moon; I can still recall it vividly. The history of aeronautical and space exploration is one full not only of human heroes such as Yuri Gagarin but also of animal explorers, albeit passive ones. It was the Montgolfier brothers in 1783, worried about the effects of high altitude on human health, who hung a basket containing a live sheep, cockerel and duck below one of their earliest balloons.  This also turns out to be an early example of a controlled experiment: the sheep was there to represent human physiological responses, the duck as a control because they are accustomed to high altitudes and the cockerel as a second control since it is a bird not accustomed to high altitudes. All three survived their brief flight, in front of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and subsequently man took to the air. Like the Montgolfier brothers, early space scientists were concerned about whether humans would be able to survive travel in space. So in 1947, a few fruit flies were the first animals in space, launched on top of an American V2 rocket and safely returned to earth, unlike many of the animals that followed them in the next decades. During the late 1940s and 1950s a series of American rhesus monkeys all called Albert made trips with varying degrees of success into space. They showed humans could survive the rigour of space travel, or at least straight-up, straight-down missions. The Russians’ chosen species to be their animal astronaut was the “stray dog”. Dogs were chosen for their physiological similarities to humans and strays were preferred as they already had experience of toughing it out on the freezing streets of Russia.  Laika, a mongrel from Moscow, became the first animal to go into orbit in 1957. She was sent into space with no way of returning her to Earth. It had been anticipated that Laika would have survived a week or so with the food and oxygen supplied to her, but Sputnik 2 overheated and she died after only a few hours. Yet it was the missions with Laika and many other dogs that finally led to the cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin becoming the first human being in space in 1961.  Despite the success of the first human, many more animals would be flown into space, especially dogs (more than 50 missions) and primates (more than 30 missions).  One of the most famous primate missions was undertaken by a young male chimpanzee called Ham in 1961. Ham had received mission training using positive reinforcement (banana pellets) and punishment (mild electric shock to his feet) to get him to pull levers during his mission – showing that astronauts did not have to be mere passengers. The use of animal astronauts therefore laid the foundations for human space flight. As scientists wished to answer questions such as how microgravity will affect the flight of a butterfly, the formation of a spider’s web or a gecko’s reproduction, a veritable zoo of animals have gone beyond the Earth’s atmosphere. Some of the experiments Peake is conducting during his time in space concern astrobiology, which sounds very cool to a mere Earth-bound biologist. He’s using the European Space Agency’s module called EXPOSE, which houses a variety of organisms such as bacteria and fungi which are exposed to the harsh conditions of space to see if they can survive.   The challenges of life in space are considerable – from huge temperature fluctuations, radiation and life in a vacuum – so the organisms chosen are known on Earth as extremophiles, species normally found in extreme conditions such as close to underwater volcanic vents (that is, high temperatures and extreme chemical conditions). So far microorganisms known as “water bears” or tardigrades and some bacteria have been shown to survive the extreme conditions of space. Data from experiments on the International Space Station will enlighten us about the possibility of life on other planets and provide information useful for human lead trips to Mars and beyond. My kids are rightly excited by the work of human astronauts but we should not forget the contribution that animals have made. And in 2008 Russia built a monument to Laika hailing her contribution to human space exploration."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online German FOCUS here reports that the climate conferences and overall movement have turned more into hysteria and increasingly are becoming remote of fact. Good to see that the German media is finally backing off from all the hysteria and lending a bit of coverage to more moderate, non-hysterical voices.
Tol: “Very limited impact”
FOCUS writes that “some leading scientists are calling for sense instead of hysteria“, quoting renowned Dutch economist Richard Tol: “During the entire 21st century climate change will likely have only a very limited impact on the economy and human prosperity.”
Risk sacrificing prosperity for a huge “wind turbine graveyard”
Another skeptic voice that has become alarmed over the hysterical claims being made by scientists and activists is conservative top politician Arnold Vaatz, who cautions against placing too much emphasis only on projections from computer models. Vaatz, a trained mathematician, warns that if the models are refuted by observations, we could wind up with a “climate panic-driven overhaul of our society that will be a deadly false path for our economy and prove to be the highpoint in the waste of resources.” Vaatz adds:
Do our citizens really want to sacrifice their good standard of living for a wind park graveyard in Germany?“
Sahara greening “absolutely positive trend”
Another increasingly skeptical voice presented by FOCUS is that of geo-archeologist Stefan Kröpelin of the University of Cologne, a veteran researcher of the Saharan climate history. He reminds that the recent climate change has been a blessing for the Sahara, which has seen a greening due to more precipitation: “For many millions of people it is an absolutely positive trend.”
FOCUS adds that “studies and long-term observations also show that many many horror scenarios are unfounded.”
The German news weekly writes that Richard Tol analyzed a number of studies and concluded that a global warming of 1.7°C would produce “net advantages for man and the earth’s ecosystem.”

Another leading politician who is becoming increasingly doubtful of the climate hysteria is Peter Ramsauer (CSU) who says the massive and ideologically driven spending of billions and billions to reduce CO2 “is beyond every political and economic reason“. FOCUS quotes Ramsauer:  “We need a climate policy with sense instead of one with green ideology!“
FOCUS adds:
For experts like Ramsauer, climate policy has gotten totally out of hand.”
Potsdam science “on shaky ground”
Increasingly more and more German politicians are growing dissastisfied with the wild doom & gloom scenarios put out by the infamously alarmist Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), directed by Professor Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber. But also German scientists are becoming aggravated by the inflated horror scanrios churned out by the PIK scientists. FOCUS reports that according to geoarcheologist Kröpelin “some of the ‘horror scenarios of the Potsdam scientists’ are already on shaky ground“.
Kröpelin tells FOCUS:
I often wish for more scientific self-imposed skepticism instead of dogmatism.”
FOCUS adds that CO2 is being unfairly singled out as only a climate-killing gas and reminds us, citing Hans-Joachim Weigel, Director of the Johann Heinrich von Thünen-Institute for Biodiversity, that it’s an “essential building block of photosynthesis and thus the basis for all life“.
The FOCUS slap-down of climate hysteria is just the latest of a series of recent articles by leading German media outlets expressing criticism of the spate of wild horror scenarios that have been uncritically released to the public recently.
Hopefully the media will continue bringing us such sober reporting regularly in the future. All the scare-mongering and doomsday scenarios have been a serious disservice to the field of science.

"Australia has experienced its driest spring on record and its second-hottest in terms of maximum temperatures, only 0.04C behind the record set in 2014. An average of only 27.4mm of rain fell across the nation for the season, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, while temperature records tumbled from coast to coast as the country endured severe and catastrophic bushfires. The driest spring on record follows the hottest ever summer, the third-warmest autumn, the sixth-warmest winter, the hottest March on record, the third-hottest July, and the hottest month ever recorded in Australia (January 2019). In November, the intense heat, bone-dry conditions and high winds meant catastrophic fire danger levels were declared for parts of New South Wales, Western Australia, South Australia and in the Greater Sydney region for the first time. Catastrophic is the highest level of fire danger, the equivalent of the conditions on the day of the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, which were Australia’s deadliest. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon Hundreds of bushfires burned across Australia this spring, and in the five days between 16 and 21 November, records tumbled for the highest median spring temperature in parts of five states: NSW, WA, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania. The bureau’s outlook for summer similarly predicts higher than average temperatures, drier than average conditions, and more severe fire conditions. The bureau said this was a result of a strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole, a negative phase of the Southern Annular Mode and the long-term trends in global temperatures as a result of global heating from human-driven climate change."

==============================
The sun drives the climate: Proof of the 90 and 200-year cycles in the earth’s climate history
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Solar activity fluctuates very much in cycles, among them the Gleissberg Cycle over 90 years, plus or minus 30 years. In March 2015 a study by Orgutsov et al. appeared in the journal Advances in Space Research which discovered the solar Gleissberg Cycle during the growth period of the northern hemisphere over the past 450 years. The authors suspected a solar impact on temperatures on plant growth. The abstract:
Evidence for the Gleissberg solar cycle at the high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere
Time evolution of growing season temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere was analyzed using both wavelet and Fourier approaches. A century-scale (60–140 year) cyclicity was found in the summer temperature reconstruction from the Taymir peninsula (∼72° N, ∼105° E) and other high-latitude (60–70° N) regions during the time interval AD 1576–1970. This periodicity is significant and consists of two oscillation modes, 60–70 year and 120–140 year variations. In the summer temperatures from the Yamal peninsula (∼70° N, ∼67° E) only a shorter-term (60–70 year) variation is present. A comparison of the secular variation in the Northern Hemisphere temperature proxies with the corresponding variations in sunspot numbers and the fluxes of cosmogenic 10Be in Greenland ice shows that a probable cause of this variability is the modulation of temperature by the century-scale solar cycle of Gleissberg. This is consistent with the results obtained previously for Northern Fennoscandia (67°–70° N, 19°–33° E). Thus, evidence for a connection between century-long variations in solar activity and climate was obtained for the entire boreal zone of the Northern Hemisphere.”
A year earlier Ogurtsov and a Finnish colleague had already published another paper on the Gleissberg cycles in the Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics. Back then they reported a solar Gleissberg Cycle in the nitrate concentrations in polar ice cores:
Evidence of the solar Gleissberg cycle in the nitrate concentration in polar ice
Two sets of nitrate (NO3−) concentration data, obtained from Central Greenland and East Antarctic (Dronning Maud Land) ice cores, were analyzed statistically. Distinct century-scale (50–150 yr) variability was revealed in both data sets during AD 1576–1990. It was found that century-type variation in Greenland and Antarctic nitrate correlates fairly significantly with the corresponding Gleissberg cycle: (a) in sunspot number over 1700–1970 AD; (b) in 10Be concentration in Central and South Greenland over 1576–1970 AD. Thus, presence of century-scale relationship between polar nitrate and solar activity was confirmed over the last 4 centuries. That proves that NO3− concentration in polar ice caps could serve as indicator of long-term solar variability.”

Another crucial solar cycle is the Suess-de Vries Cycle. In February 2015 Hans-Joachim Lüdecke together with his colleagues Weiss and Hempelmann published an overview of the climatic link of this solar cycle in the journal Climate of the Past Discussions:
Paleoclimate forcing by the solar De Vries/Suess cycle
A large number of investigations of paleoclimate have noted the influence of a ~ 200 year oscillation which has been related to the De Vries/Suess cycle of solar activity. As such studies were concerned mostly with local climate, we have used extensive northern hemispheric proxy data sets of Büntgen and of Christiansen/Ljungqvist together with a southern hemispheric tree-ring set, all with 1 year time resolution, to analyze the climate influence of the solar cycle. As there is increasing interest in temperature rise rates, as opposed to present absolute temperatures, we have analyzed temperature differences over 100 years to shed light on climate dynamics of at least the last 2500 years. Fourier- and Wavelet transforms as well as nonlinear optimization to sine functions show the dominance of the ∼ 200 year cycle. The sine wave character of the climate oscillations permits an approximate prediction of the near future climate.”
Also a paper by Tiwari und Rajesh published in May, 2014 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters is in full agreement with the above paper. In it the authors found the Suess-de Vries cycle in the precipitation distribution in Northwest China over the past 700 years:
Imprint of long-term solar signal in groundwater recharge fluctuation rates from Northwest China
Multiple spectral and statistical analyses of a 700 yearlong temporal record of groundwater recharge from the dry lands, Badain Jaran Desert (Inner Mongolia) of Northwest China reveal a stationary harmonic cycle at ~200 ± 20 years. Interestingly, the underlying periodicity in groundwater recharge fluctuations is similar to those of solar-induced climate cycle “Suess wiggles” and appears to be coherent with phases of the climate fluctuations and solar cycles. Matching periodicity of groundwater recharge rates and solar and climate cycles renders a strong impression that solar-induced climate signals may act as a critical amplifier for driving the underlying hydrographic cycle through the common coupling of long-term Sun-climate groundwater linkages.”

"Your article (Guardian climate score: how did your MP do?, 11 October) notes that “the approach used has certain limitations”. In fact it is massively flawed in its methods, and misleading and partial as a result. It takes just 16 climate-, energy- and environment-related votes in parliament among hundreds cast between 2008 and 2018, and adds a narrative based on the register of MPs’ interests. But not all votes are the same, and many of these issues are highly contested. The landlord energy efficiency vote, for example, was on just one of many amendments to the 2011 energy bill, and reasonable people can (and did) disagree about its likely effect. Yet the climate score includes it, and yet somehow ignores the energy bill itself, a major piece of environmental legislation.  It also ignores, for example, the vote on the government’s commitment to decarbonise the UK economy by 2050 – an absolutely path-breaking step for such a major global economy. Indeed, one could read the Guardian’s climate score all through and be wholly unaware that the government has massively reduced greenhouse gas emissions to their lowest levels for 100 years, cut plastic bag use by 90%, and boosted renewables to levels unimagined in 2010, among numerous other achievements. As for the narrative: this sought to associate me with the Global Warming Policy Forum, an organisation I have never met or had any relationship with. As a minister I have vigorously promoted offshore wind and other renewables, launched the Road to Zero strategy to decarbonise transport, and strongly supported cycling and walking investment, among much else. These are matters of public record.Jesse NormanConservative party parliamentary candidate for Hereford and South Herefordshire"
"The number of insurers withdrawing cover for coal projects more than doubled this year and for the first time US companies have taken action, leaving Lloyd’s of London and Asian insurers as the “last resort” for fossil fuels, according to a report. The report, which rates the world’s 35 biggest insurers on their actions on fossil fuels, declares that coal – the biggest single contributor to climate change – “is on the way to becoming uninsurable” as most coal projects cannot be financed, built or operated without insurance. Ten firms moved to restrict the insurance cover they offer to companies that build or operate coal power plants in 2019, taking the global total to 17, said the Unfriend Coal campaign, which includes 13 environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Client Earth and Urgewald, a German NGO. The report will be launched at an insurance and climate risk conference in London on Monday, as the UN climate summit gets under way in Madrid. The first insurers to exit coal policies were all European, but since March, two US insurers – Chubb and Axis Capital – and the Australian firms QBE and Suncorp have pledged to stop or restrict insurance for coal projects. At least 35 insurers with combined assets of $8.9tn, equivalent to 37% of the insurance industry’s global assets, have begun pulling out of coal investments. A year ago, 19 insurers holding more than $6tn in assets were divesting from fossil fuels. Peter Bosshard, one of the Unfriend Coal campaign co-ordinators, said: “We hope within two to three years it will be so difficult to obtain insurance that most coal projects won’t be able to go forward. “We’ve seen the acceleration [in firms pulling out of coal] for a good reason – people are freaking out.” As global temperatures climb, hurricanes, wildfires and floods have become more frequent and severe, resulting in higher claims bills for insurers. Lloyd’s, the world’s biggest insurance market, is the only major European firm which continues to insure new coal projects. Bosshard said it had a critical role to play: “Together with Asian insurers, the Lloyd’s market is becoming the ‘insurer of last resort’ for a dying and destructive industry.” Lloyd’s started excluding coal from its investments in its own £4bn central mutual fund in April 2018. However, its chief executive John Neal last month ruled out issuing guidelines on underwriting coal projects to its member syndicates. Lloyd’s said: “We take climate change extremely seriously and recognise the important role insurance can play in supporting, accelerating and de-risking the transition to a low carbon economy. “Whilst Lloyd’s Corporation does not set underwriting policy in the market, except if there is a specific legal or regulatory requirement to do so, we are nevertheless committed to building consensus across the 90-plus syndicates that operate at Lloyd’s about how we make this transition.”"
"The climate change debate left me mournful: it wasn’t the montage of environmental emergency that opened it, though if I never heard the sound of a koala in pain again, that would be a-OK. It wasn’t any of the individual leaders, who all put their best foot forward, though weren’t without their less appealing moments. It was the magnificent insufficiency of politics, all its conventions, all its rubric, in the face of this disaster. There is nothing like watching five people who fundamentally agree – who all believe the science, who all want to see children grow up into a liveable world, who all see this as the most pressing challenge humanity could face – try to suck endless arguments out of who believes it the most, and whose track record shows them in the best light, that makes you doubt our collective ability to fix this, or indeed, anything. Green co-leader Sian Berry was superb at points, but there was this lacuna where her honest opinion should have been. Maybe never before or after, but at this point in time, a serious Green would be asking people to stop a Conservative majority – which would not, even with Swinsonian delusion, involve voting Green, except in two or three places in the country. Jeremy Corbyn momentarily rehumanised himself by admitting that he was too miserable to turn the central heating on, but was forced by the invisible hand of political normalcy to attack the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon. Adam Price asserted Plaid Cymru’s determination to halt the third runway in Heathrow and HS2, which realistically they could only ever do as handmaidens to a Labour government, which will involve cooperating, so why not start cooperating now? Sturgeon paraded her green credentials as the party of government in Scotland, but it was ridiculous; of course she’s planted 22m trees and what’s everyone else done? She’s in government! Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson made her opening statement about Brexit, which far from sounding like a gestalt answer to all British politics, made her look as though she could only see any issue for its political advantage. They all say what we need is systems change, but their adversarial parade that stands in for discussion is one of the systems that needs to change first. • Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist Overall, it was a reasonably positive hour of political telly. There was very little point-scoring, and time to get into some juicy details without wasting precious minutes just shouting Brexit soundbites at each other. Still, the danger was that it would be boring. Do these parties have anything very much to argue about when it comes climate and nature? It turns out they did. Labour and the SNP both came in for criticism over airport expansion. Everyone wriggled a bit when it came to questions about food, seemingly scared of upsetting farmers and meat-eaters, and no one really seemed to grasp the challenge of decarbonising heat, or was willing to admit how disruptive it might to our homes or how much it might cost, despite some excellent probing from Krishnan Guru-Murthy. Plus there was the predictable spat over whether 2030, 2045 or 2050 was a good target for net zero carbon emissions (when arguably the important thing is what we do now). The other leaders ganged up on Labour a bit over nuclear. But the party that really needed more attention was the Conservatives. In fact it took nearly half an hour before anyone mentioned them. And as a result, their record wasn’t examined, and it needed to be. Ultimately, if Johnson wants to lead us through the vital next five years, we need to publicly scrutinise what he plans to do. In many ways the ice sculptures that stood in for the Tory and Brexit party leaders were genius, and I hope the image of them dripping haunts those who didn’t turn up. But I worry they left Johnson in particular off the hook. Channel 4 might have been better served filling his empty chair with a fact-checkers tasked with examining the Conservative record on each of the topics raised instead. • Alice Bell is co-director of climate charity Possible Hours after the European parliament declared a climate emergency, a day after scientists warned that we are close to irreversible climate disaster, and a week before the start of the most important UN climate meeting since 2015, the man most likely to be prime minister ducked out of a debate about what most people understand is the most important issue of the age. Well, wouldn’t you if you had shafted solar power, backed fracking, said concern for climate change was primitive fear, banned wind power on land and called young protesters “smug, irritating and disruptive”? It didn’t matter. His place was taken by a melting ice cube and his non-existence was treated like an embarrassing smell coming off the Arctic permafrost. Without Tory bluster, and with sensible questions from Krishnan Guru-Murthy, there was surprising harmony and politeness, with the five leaders often competing to agree with each other, with cries of “absolutely”, and “of course” – the kind you get from people who have just woken to the fact that buses, soil, trees and lagging is really, really interesting and important and that the fate of the world has been totally ignored for too long. Yes, there was old thinking. No one committed to ruling out new roads or airport expansions. Jo Swinson seemed astonished that houses in Yorkshire could be made warm in November without heating. Corbyn still warmed to nuclear. But there was much more of the new. Adam Price of Plaid Cyrmu promised to turn to reusable nappies and Corbyn promised to plant 2bn trees in 10 years. But the overriding impression was of leaders with a modicum of vision of a new industrial revolution, with new thinking about the land and a new agenda to push. “Is any of this real?” cried Krishnan Guru-Murthy. “It’s progress,” said Sian Berry, a Green co-leader, delighted to see her party’s ideas finally in the mainstream. But the ice cube had by then probably melted. • John Vidal is the Guardian’s former environment editor When writing snap reactions to political debates, one is usually expected to pick a winner. But I honestly couldn’t tell you which leader won the climate debate as it was so esoteric and interminably boring I found it hard to focus. It was commendable of Channel 4 to host a debate solely on the most important issue facing humanity, but the dry and complicated hour of television that resulted is emblematic of the problem with the mainstream climate debate as a whole. All too often, climate is talked about in terms of technology and policy, when in fact it is an issue of politics. The only reason we’re in absolutely dire straits now is because the people who had the power to do something sooner benefitted from keeping things exactly as they were. The debate failed to mention fossil fuel companies and the great campaigns of lobbying and misinformation they engage in. It failed to mention climate denial, and the fact that this is overwhelmingly a rightwing pursuit. The debate focused on minutiae to the point of absurdity. “My kids have never seen a hedgehog,” exclaimed Jo Swinson at one point. As for the leaders themselves, it was frustrating to see Jeremy Corbyn be intermittently denounced when the reality is that this election is our last hope to transition to a green economy, and he is the only person that can do it. The other leaders on the panel may not like that, indeed some of the audience may not either, but it remains a fact. The leaders should have joined together to repeatedly condemn the absence of Boris Johnson, who inexplicably sent his dad to do the debate instead, like some kind of chastened errant schoolboy. The real winners were climate activists, whose hard work and dedication created the demand for the debate in the first place. The political mainstream better learn how to talk about climate with the same clear-eyed urgency as them, for all our sakes. • Ellie Mae O’Hagan is a freelance journalist"
"Eating more fruit and vegetables and cutting back on red and processed meat will make you healthier. That’s obvious enough. But as chickens and cows themselves eat food and burn off their own energy, meat is a also major driver of climate change. Going veggie can drastically reduce your carbon footprint.  This is all at a personal level. What about when you multiply such changes by 7 billion people, and factor in a growing population?  In our latest research, colleagues and I estimate that changes towards more plant-based diets in line with the WHO’s global dietary guidelines could avert 5m-8m deaths per year by 2050. This represents a 6-10% reduction in global mortality. Food-related greenhouse gas emissions would also be cut by more than two thirds. In all, these dietary changes would have a value to society of more than US$1 trillion – even as much as US$30 trillion. That’s up to a tenth of the likely global GDP in 2050. Our results are published in the journal PNAS. Future projections of diets paint a grim picture. Fruit and vegetable consumption is expected to increase, but so is red meat consumption and the amount of calories eaten in general. Of the 105 world regions included in our study, fewer than a third are on course to meet dietary recommendations.  A bigger population, eating a worse diet, means that by 2050 food-related GHG emissions will take up half of the “emissions budget” the world has for limiting global warming to less than 2℃. To see how dietary changes could avert such a doom and gloom scenario, we constructed four alternative diets and analysed their health and environmental impacts: one reference scenario based on projections of diets in 2050; a scenario based on global dietary guidelines which includes minimum amounts of fruits and vegetables, and limits to the amount of red meat, sugar, and total calories; and two vegetarian scenarios, one including eggs and dairy (lacto-ovo vegetarian), and the other completely plant-based (vegan). We found that adoption of global dietary guidelines could result in 5.1m avoided deaths per year in 2050. Vegetarian and vegan diets could result in 7.3m and 8.1m avoided deaths respectively. About half of this is thanks to eating less red meat. The other half comes thanks to eating more fruit and veg, along with a reduction in total energy intake (and the associated decreases in obesity). There are huge regional variations. About two thirds of the health benefits of dietary change are projected to occur in developing countries, in particular in East Asia and South Asia. But high-income countries closely follow, and the per-person benefits in developed countries could actually be twice as large as those in developing countries, as their relatively more imbalanced diets leave greater room for improvement. China would see the largest health benefits, with around 1.4m to 1.7m averted deaths per year. Cutting red meat and reducing general overconsumption would be the most important factor there and in other big beneficiaries such as the EU and the US. In India, however, up to a million deaths per year would be avoided largely thanks to eating more fruit and vegetables. Russia and other Eastern European countries would see huge benefits per-person, in particular due to less red meat consumption. People in small island nations such as Mauritius and Trinidad and Tobago would benefit due to reduced obesity. We estimated that adopting global dietary guidelines would cut food-related emissions by 29%. But even this still wouldn’t be enough to reduce food-related greenhouse gas emissions in line with the overall cutbacks necessary to keep global temperature increases below 2°C.  To seriously fight climate change, more plant-based diets will be needed. Our analysis shows if the world went vegetarian that cut in food-related emissions would rise to 63%. And if everyone turned vegan? A huge 70%.  Dietary changes would have huge economic benefits, leading to savings of US$700-1,000 billion per year globally in healthcare, unpaid informal care and lost working days. The value that society places on the reduced risk of dying could even be as high as 9-13% of global GDP, or US$20-$30 trillion. Avoided climate change damages from reduced food-related greenhouse gas emissions could be as much as US$570 billion. Putting a dollar value on good health and the environment is a sensitive issue. However, our results indicate that dietary changes could have large benefits to society, and the value of those benefits makes a strong case for healthier and more environmentally sustainable diets. The scale of the task is clearly enormous. Fruit and vegetable production and consumption would need to more than double in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia just to meet global dietary recommendations, whereas red meat consumption would need to be halved globally, and cut by two thirds in richer countries. We’d also need to tackle the key problem of overconsumption. It’s a lot to chew on."

At Twitter Dr. Ryan Maue writes that the data used at www.wunderground.com is “very wrong”. Dr. Maue even adds that ACE is in fact currently “nearing a peak b/c of El Nino  models.weatherbell.com/tropical.php“
Who’s right? Looks like Dr. Maue has the right figures and the ACE is peaking:

Note: The global 4-year ACE still remains near a 45-year low.

At Twitter earlier today Philip Klotzbach tweeted, “Seasonal ACE only 50% of normal thru 9/9.”
Indeed looking at weather site www.wunderground.com we see that global cyclone activity measured by the “Accumulated Cyclone Energy” (ACE) index over the past four years is even at a 45-year low!

Global Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) since 1970. Chart shows that storm activity worldwide over the past 4 years is at a 45-year low and that the trend has been in steep decline since 1990. Source: www.wunderground.com.
Some years ago alarmist climate scientists, who insist a consensus backs their science, claimed with high certainty that global warming would increase the frequency and intensity of cyclones globally. We were told to expect “super-charged storms”, all fueled by global warming heat.
Well, something must be awfully wrong with their science. The exact opposite is true. The same has happened with temperature, global sea ice, and snow cover.
Perhaps the global warming experts will tell us that the huge cyclones are hidden somewhere deep in the oceans along with the “missing heat”, getting ready to pounce later in the future.

"Earlier this year, when the fascist responsible for the El Paso massacre cited ecological degradation as part motivation for his killing spree, many considered him entirely deranged. Eco-fascism sounds oxymoronic, a mashup of irreconcilable philosophies.  Yet, while eco-fascists violently oppose contemporary environmentalists, they often appropriate ideas from the past of the environmental movement. In the United States, the first conservationists – men like Teddy Roosevelt – were wealthy big-game hunters trying to preserve creatures they liked to shoot. These elite enthusiasts for “the manly sport with the rifle” blamed impoverished arrivals from eastern and central Europe for “pot hunting” – that is, for killing game for food or money rather than for fun. But they also saw immigrants as polluting America’s racial stock, making an explicit parallel between “lesser races” and the invasive species threatening native animals and plants. On that basis, Julia Scott from the Daughters of the American Revolution could speak at the National Conservation Congress of 1910, urging attendees not only to protect flora and fauna but to conserve “the supremacy of the Caucasian race in our land”. You can get a sense of the centrality of eugenic theory to the early movement from the career of Madison Grant, the most important environmentalist of his generation. We can thank Grant for saving the American bison, the bald eagle, the pronghorn antelope, the Alaskan bear and the fur seal, as well as, according to his biographer, contributing to the preservation of elephants, gorillas, koalas and many other charismatic species. But Grant also campaigned for the racist Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924, and wrote the bestselling The Passing of the Great Race, or The Racial Basis of European History, an impassioned defence of white supremacy that Hitler described as his personal “bible”. The book’s popularity in Germany was not coincidental. Grant, like many of his colleagues, derived his environmentalism from a conservative Romanticism, the philosophical source for Nazi concepts about the importance of Lebensraum (living room) and Blut und Boden (blood and soil). Modern eco-fascists still draw on the same Romantic contrast between the sublime hierarchies of nature and the supposedly effete degeneracy of modernity. They also exploit the legacy of a tendency influential in environmental circles in much more recent times. In 1968, Paul Ehrlich published a book called The Population Bomb, in which he argued that ecological destruction – and, indeed, almost all social problems – could be attributed to overpopulation. As the historian Thomas Robertson notes, few signs of a mass environmental movement existed when The Population Bomb first appeared. Yet, “by the spring of 1970, Americans could hardly pick up a magazine or a newspaper without seeing mention of ecology and the environment”. That year, the first Earth Day attracted an astonishing 20 million people to environmental teach-ins, a result attributable at least in part to Ehrlich. Today, his influence – and that of population theory more generally – has waned considerably, not least because the rate of world population growth has slowed substantially while his predictions of ever-worsening famines in the 1970s proved spectacularly wrong. But progressive environmentalists also recognised the succour populationism provided to the extreme right. The attribution of ecological destruction to demographic growth obscures the social relations through which, for instance, a mere 20 fossil fuel companies can be linked to more than one-third of greenhouse gas emissions in the modern era. Worse still, arguments that (in theory) blame all people often (in practice) target particular people: usually the poor and the oppressed. The Population Bomb itself opened with Ehrlich describing how he’d understood the case for population control “emotionally” during a visit to Delhi where, he said, the streets “seemed alive with people” and the “dust, noise, heat and cooking fires gave the scene a hellish aspect”. At the time, Delhi housed some 2.8 million while the population of Paris stood at about eight million – and yet it would be difficult to imagine Ehrlich reacting with equivalent disgust to crowds on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées. Other populationists came to oppose not just fertility but also immigration, on the basis that, if the teeming masses from poor nations moved to the rich world, they’d adopt a western resource-heavy lifestyle. As a result, as academics Sebastian Normandin and Sean A Valles argue, America’s modern anti-immigrant movement “was built and led by – and in some cases is still led by – a network of conservationists and population control activists”. The vast majority of greens now disavow the environmental populationist John Tanton, who, according to Susan A Berger, constructed many of the anti-Mexican organisations relied upon by Donald Trump as he electioneered for his border wall during the 2016 poll. Yet the argument that ordinary people, rather than social structures, should be blamed for climate change still circulates – and invariably pushes in rightwing directions. Think of the El Paso shooter and the document in which he justified his racial massacre. “If we can get rid of enough people,” he wrote, “then our way of life can become more sustainable.” The glibness with which he advocates environmental murder marks the El Paso perpetrator as distinctly fascist. Fortunately, genuine fascists remain on the political margins in the English-speaking world. Nevertheless, we can increasingly imagine the space that eco-fascism might occupy. When asylum seekers fleeing floods and famines arrive on Australian shores in their millions, how will politicians respond? Unless there’s a radical shift in the political culture, they will, presumably, rely upon the strategies perfected during decades of bipartisan anti-refugee campaigning, deploying the familiar arsenal of boat turnbacks, naval patrols and offshore detention, albeit on a much, much larger scale. In other words, they’ll embrace an approach already advocated by European racist populists like Marine Le Pen’s National Rally, who posits massively intensified border policing as a “realistic” response to the inevitability of the environmental disaster. Just as the stop-the-boats campaigners of recent decades depict refugee advocates as indifferent to drownings at sea, the supporters of “green” border policing will denounce climate activists for sabotaging “practical” responses to climate change with their utopianism. It’s not difficult to imagine “eco-authoritarianism” or what Naomi Klein calls “climate barbarism”: a politics centred on the state making “our way of life” sustainable as the environment disintegrates. Future governments committed to this project will be able to draw upon the vast array of coercive powers they’ve acquired over the past decades: draconian anti-protest laws; secret trials and imprisonment; the deployment of the army to quell civil disturbances; and so on. Eco-fascism represents a related but distinctive tendency. It will emerge not through the state but as a political movement, with people like the El Paso perpetrator violently defending climate privilege against immigrants, environmentalists and progressives. We’re nowhere near that point yet. But it’s a lot less unimaginable than it should be.

"A new international organisation should be set up to raise and distribute funds to nations who will suffer the worst impacts of global heating. That is the key conclusion of a UK report – Addressing the Impacts of Climate Change – that will be debated this week at the COP25 climate talks in Madrid. The authors argue that the cash raised by the new body should be used in addition to the $100bn a year rich countries have pledged to help poorer nations cut their carbon emissions and adapt to the climate crisis.  These new funds would compensate nations who suffer the most acute effects of rising temperatures, in terms of the cultural devastation, loss of traditional jobs and eradication of biodiversity inflicted on them. “Many countries most affected by climate change did little to cause it, yet they face significant losses and damages,” state the report’s authors, Rebecca Byrnes and Swenja Surminski of Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. Funds to compensate for that loss and damage are now desperately needed, and cannot be delayed, they insist.  This week’s international climate meeting will be held in Madrid after political disturbances in Chile, its original host country, forced a change of venue. Delegates are expected to focus most attention on market mechanisms that could best achieve carbon emission cuts and on the losses and damages to culture, livelihoods and biodiversity facing developing nations on a heated planet. Compensation should be provided for affected nations, some delegates will argue – a notion that others will find controversial. Yet it is clear, says the report that the impacts of climate change are already going beyond mere inconvenience for nations and are already harming health, biodiversity, traditions, culture, livelihoods and many other aspects of life. An example of the problems that lie ahead is provided by the impact of sea-level rises on ancestral homes and burial grounds in island states in the Pacific. These special cultural and religious places are now at severe risk of submersion. Yet families have used them for generations. In this way, climate change threatens many people’s entire cultural experience. Similarly, livelihoods – such as fishing or herding – will be destroyed in a warming world and money will be needed to help people train for other occupations. Economists estimate that, if global temperature rises are kept under 2C, the damage to developing nations caused by rising sea levels, spreading deserts and changing ecosystems will reach $200bn a year by 2030. However, this sum would rise to $4tn a year if temperature rises were allowed to reach 3C or more. According to the UN Environment Programme report last week, this latter scenario remains the more likely. Unep said that in 2018 total carbon emissions reached the equivalent of 55 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide – an atmospheric input that is putting the Earth on course for a temperature rise of 3.2C by the end of this century. “A lot of money has been promised to help disaster risk management and development in developing countries, and that has been considered to be developed nations’ ways of reducing the worst impacts of global warming,” Surminski said. “But we need something extra. Losses and damages are already occurring, and countries need support for that as well.” Just where the funds for such efforts will come from is difficult to assess, however. President Trump has indicated that the US will pull out of the existing Paris climate agreement and he is unlikely to be an enthusiastic supporter of compensation schemes for poorer nations. The task is a desperate one, said Surminski. “It might look difficult now, but if we leave it until later it will be almost impossible.”"
"Steel might be the largest industrial carbon dioxide emitter, but Britain’s troubled industry could be a big part of a cleaner, greener future. By using steel to build new infrastructure for renewable energy, the UK could create a virtuous circle of improvement for its industry and growth. Ignore calls to subsidise additional supply in a market where there is already too much steel to go round. Britain instead needs a proactive industrial strategy to stimulate demand for its steel, and one that has sustainability at its heart. Here are nine ways steel could be used in a clean industrial transformation: This is the long-mooted plan to build an enormous tidal power station across the Severn Estuary. Around 1.5m tonnes of steel would be required for turbines, embankments and to reinforce the concrete – a good chunk of the UK’s current annual output of 10m tonnes. Anchoring wind turbines to the ground or seabed requires vast amounts of concrete reinforced with steel. Onshore wind uses an average of 160 tonnes of steel per megawatt, according to one 2011 estimate, while offshore the figure rises to 450 tonnes.  Although fossil fuel and nuclear power station require much less, they still rely on other finite resources. If the UK is serious about exploiting its fantastic wind resources it will need a lot of steel for the domestic market, with a view to eventually exporting turbine technology to other nations. Better rail links would mean people taking trains instead of cars or carbon-intensive domestic flights. But, again, this will require lots of steel. Every kilometre of new high speed railway requires 282 tonnes of steel for the rails themselves. Overhead line equipment – the masts, gantries and overhead wires – add a further 500 tonnes per km, and tunnels and bridges also need reinforcing. Conventional electrified rail will also require new rolling stock – an average train is around 57% steel, or 27 tonnes. There are proposals for an HS3 line to Newcastle along with an HS4 to connect Bristol and the West Country with London. A Severn Barrage could also create a new transport corridor into Wales as Brunel’s tunnel is already at capacity. These hundreds of kilometres of new line could transform regional economies, rebalance the UK – and boost demand for steel. Steel can be “sprayed” with photovoltaic material to create roofs and facades that can harvest solar energy. Researchers are evaluating thin film silicon, chalcopyrite and organic solar to find the best solution. It won’t overtake regular solar panels just yet but, given roofs cover 1.8% of the UK’s land, the potential is enormous. Academics at Cardiff University have been working on a neat way to keep your home warm, using profiled perforated steel mounted on the south-facing walls of buildings. It is specially-treated to absorb as much solar energy as possible. The sun creates a warm boundary layer of air around the steel sheet, which a fan then distributes through the building. Large-scale solar plants can also use mounting systems made from steel. Government subsidy cuts have caused the UK solar industry to falter, but past performance has shown its potential.  The pylons familiar to most British people were designed in 1928. Demand from electric vehicles will soon grow massively, heating is becoming electric rather than gas-powered, and small-scale wind and solar generation all needs to be linked up. This new electricity infrastructure will require new plyons, which may be welcome news for the Pylon Appreciation Society. In Iceland, pylons have been elevated to an art form that adds to the landscape. Tesla has gone back to steel for its latest car, the Model 3. After initially using composites, the company said the cost and mass production advantages of steel were too strong to ignore.  Yet steel doesn’t have to mean bulky and inefficient. The Future Steel Vehicle concept achieves body mass savings of 35% compared to standard vehicles, and shows weight reduction is possible without ditching steel.  The huge furnaces found at steel plants could be connected to local heating networks. At present, steel producers consider all that heat a costly byproduct. They even have to cool the water used in the manufacturing process between each use, which requires lots of energy. However, in harnessing the waste heat and selling it to consumers, they could even turn a profit. Such a scheme already exists in Sheffield and could be extended to other steel towns such as Scunthorpe or Port Talbot."
"You’ve probably heard the stories of huge butter mountains and wine lakes, and moneybags landowners living the high life thanks to subsidies from unwitting urbanites. But there’s more to the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy than these cliches. With the farm subsidies already a major issue in the UK’s referendum on EU membership, let’s look at what this really involves. It’s not hard to see how the Common Agricultural Policy became known for pointless excess. When it was created in 1962, the CAP supported farmers primarily through ensuring artificially high prices for their products. This was achieved via “price support”, which turned member states into an economic island, with prices higher than elsewhere. As a direct result, farmers were encouraged to produce more and more. Since this would drive down prices, a system of “intervention buying” was introduced. If farmers couldn’t sell their stuff at a high enough price, they could sell to the government instead. But this gave farmers a guaranteed buyer, so they knew they could produce and sell as much as possible. This led, in the 1980s, to huge stored surpluses of commodities including infamous amounts of butter and wine (actually industrial alcohol – there were never vats of Cabernet or Chardonnay lying around). Since then, more than 20 years of CAP reforms have led to the removal of these high prices and, with it, the ending of such surpluses. We’re dealing with very large numbers here and some perspective is necessary. Agricultural policy is a big deal in terms of EU spending – only development aid for poorer regions can compare – but perhaps less so when compared to the UK’s national budget. In 2014, the EU budget as a whole was just under 1% of the union’s “gross national income”, whereas the UK budget that year was about 44% of its gross domestic product (GDP). These are two slightly different ways of measuring national wealth – but not that different.  The UK government expected to spend £743 billion last financial year, approximately €960 billion at current exchange rates. The EU plans to spend €155 billion this year, with about €62 billion, or 40%, earmarked for agriculture and rural development. This is equivalent to just over 6% of total UK spending. For the entire EU.  The UK paid €14 billion (£11.3 billion) into the 2014 EU budget, and received back €7 billion (£5.6 billion) in payments, mostly agriculture subsidies and regional development support. Payments into the EU budget are based on national income whereas the amount a country receives in EU farm subsidies is largely dictated by the size of its agricultural sector. This means a richer, urbanised, nation like the UK, where farming is relatively small, and which is a net food importer, will tend to be a large net contributor to the EU budget. In the 1980s, when the UK was comparatively poorer, it started to receive a partial rebate on its net payment. Even now, although the country has become much richer, it still receives a rebate. In 2014 this was worth just over €6 billion (£4.9 bn), leaving the UK’s net contribution to agricultural policies in other countries at approximately €1.27 billion, or about £16 each. UK farmers received €3.2 billion in direct farm subsidies in 2014. More than half of this cash went to farmers who each received less than €50,000, though about 13% went to farmers who were granted more than €150,000, and 2% of the total went to the largest farms and landowners who raked in €500,000 or more that year.  That last group tends to make the headlines, but it’s worth bearing in mind that these megafarmers and landowners such as the National Trust represent just 0.04% of the UK’s CAP funding recipients. One argument made by Brexit advocates is that payments to the EU could then be spent on other things. Yet the numbers above show how little money the UK would actually gain from this. The country also wouldn’t suddenly stop spending money on agriculture and the rural economy. On the one hand, Theresa Villiers, a cabinet member and a Brexit supporter, recently suggested that the UK could spend even more money on agriculture if it left the EU, limiting the money available for other policies.  On the other, as a previous decision not to fund rural development shows, the Treasury is not well disposed to these areas of spending. The rural economy could lose out. Significantly. This indicates the uncertainty surrounding an EU exit and the nature of the financial battles within the UK that would ensue. The UK is part of the EU’s international trade obligations under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). After Brexit, it would have to negotiate a new set of obligations with the WTO, including negotiating with the EU over a share of the trade permissions already granted.  This is no simple task, and the EU would have little incentive to be generous in those negotiations. In addition, if any agreement between the UK and EU disadvantaged other countries’ agricultural trade interests, they could bring an action in the WTO, including against the UK, for compensation."
"A woman who lost her home in the New South Wales bushfires has brought the charred remains to Parliament House to send a message to both major parties on climate change. Melinda Plesman and her partner, Dean Kennedy, lost their family home of 35 years after bushfires tore through Nymboida, south of Grafton in NSW, last month.  Plesman said she wanted to show Scott Morrison the direct result of climate change. “It’s happening now and this is what climate change looks like,” Plesman said. “I’m losing my home, whole communities are losing their homes ... and the prime minister said we’re not allowed to talk about it. “He said he was going to pray for us. And that was the last straw.” But she also criticised Labor for not wanting to discuss the link between climate change and bushfires. “That is what is absolutely terrible. We’ve got no leadership, we’ve got no discussion, we’ve got no debate, we’ve got nothing,” she said. “We need a bipartisan approach. I completely understand that the Labor party are absent in this as well.” Plesman, who is now living in a motel room, said she didn’t know what the future held for her. She said she wanted the government to set a price on carbon, phase out native forest logging, immediately shift Australia towards renewables and stop mining coal. “I think it’s the job of the prime minister to bring us together and lead us forward. That’s his job,” she said. On a sheet of corrugated iron rescued from the scorched remains her beloved home she had written: “Morrison, your climate crisis destroyed my home.” “He’s not acting,” Plesman said."

Share this...FacebookTwitterJust days ago news emerged that leading French meteorologist Philippe Verdier was reportedly sent on “forced holiday” from broadcaster France 2 for releasing book accusing top climatologists and politicians of “taking the world hostage” using deceptive data. Read the story here.

Philippe Verdier. Photo: www.change.org
The name of the book is titled is Climat Investigation and in it Verdier claims climate scientists have been “manipulated and politicised” and maintains that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) “blatantly erased” data that went against their overall conclusions, and that their climate models are inaccurate.
Monsieur Verdier now faces losing his job for holding such data-based dissenting views.
Laurent Fabius incites fear of “climate chaos”
One of the most troublesome aspects of the scandal is that top French politicians have been actively resorting to Orwellian tactics in an attempt to grotesquely distort the science and to incite irrational fear among French citizens. The Telegraph writes M. Verdier…
“…decided to write the book in June 2014 when Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, summoned the country’s main weather presenters and urged them to mention “climate chaos” in their forecasts.”

This is an absolute abuse of power, and must be regarded as intolerable.
Verdier fights back with a petition
But the French meteorologist is not backing off, and sees the move by France 2 as attempted punishment for practicing a legitimate freedom of expression and a violation of the spirit of open discussion that democracies are supposed to guarantee. He has posted the following petition:
Philippe Verdier, a journalist in charge of the weather service of the French public TV channels France Télévisions, is threatened in his job and his career for having published a non-conformist book about climate. Even if he emphasizes that he is not a climate skeptic, Philippe Verdier points out in his book all the erring ways of climate policies. He also criticizes the IPCC and its ideological views that have just nothing to do with science.
The origin of his book is Laurent Fabius’ explicit and recent attempt to get full support of all French weathermen prior to COP21, the international climate conference that will be held in Paris late November. Laurent Fabius is the French Foreign Minister and also the future president of this conference.
In January, citizens from all countries in the world stood up for freedom of speech, with « Je suis Charlie » as a motto. Time has come to stand up again. The Collectif des climato-réalistes call on you to sign this petition regardless of your opinion about climate change.”
Reader are urged to sign the petition and to urge as many others as possible to do the same.

Share this...FacebookTwitterE.on, Germany’s largest electric power producer, announced that it had lost over 7 billion euros in the 3rd quarter, reports Germany’s flagship news magazine Spiegel here.
The loss stems from the writing down of the value of coal and gas power generation assets by billions of euros due to the steep drop in wholesale electricity prices. The write-offs were necessary in light of the dismal future the fossil industry faces. Plainly said: Germany’s Energiewende, transition to renewable energies, which mandates power companies buy up solar, wind and other green energies at exorbitant prices, and even when they are not needed, continues to rapidly erode the German base-power production.
Tens of thousands of once high-paying industrial jobs are now in serious jeopardy.
“Squeezed out” by massively subsidized green energy
With mandated green energies, the European power market is seeing a huge oversupply of power on the market that has wholesale prices far too low to cover generation costs.
Spiegel writes:
The company’s gas and coal power plants are hardly earning money due to the plummeted power exchange prices. Through the [massively subsidized] green energies, the conventional power plants are being squeezed out of the market throughout the branch. The price at the Leipzig EEX power exchange has halved over the past 4 years.”
Aren’t government subsidies and market meddling wonderful?

The hemorrhaging is far from over. Spiegel also reports that “E.on had a record 3.2 billion Euro loss in 2014“. Germany’s No. 2 power producer, RWE, is also reeling. Bloomberg here writes:
Germany’s shift to renewable energy is hurting utilities from EON to RWE AG as margins get squeezed at traditional coal and gas-fired plants because green power gets priority access to the grid. EON, the third-worst performer in Germany’s DAX stock index this year, is responding by spinning off its fossil-fuel plants into a separate company. RWE in 2013 had its first annual loss since 1949.”
Poor, working class getting hit hard
The tragedy of this mandated oversupply is that low wholesale prices, which at times are even negative, are not getting passed along to the consumers. Rather next year German consumers will see new record-high electricity prices. Already poor households are reeling and electricity is becoming a luxury for the affluent only.
The media reports that the Düsseldorf-based power producer will be spinning off its “entire power plant business” in the form of a new company called Uniper at the end of the year. It is reported that E.on itself will focus on “renewable energies and sales”.
It’s a real pity. Germany’s power companies used to be solid, high tech companies that delivered the most stable and efficient power in the world. Now they are literally being gutted alive before our very eyes. The country is setting itself up for some terrible times, and doing so fast.
Industrial base, social fabric in collpase
One could easily argue that Germany, under the leadership of Angela Merkel and her CDU government, is now witnessing an uncontrolled collapse as millions of refugees flood into the country, power prices spiral out of control, conventional power companies collapse, the industrial base moves abroad, and auto-giant VW faces a death by litigation and fanatic environmental standards. Expect volatile social conditions to spread soon unless sense returns.

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated, edited by P Gosselin)
More than three years ago (February 2012) our book Die kalte Sonne (see right) made its debut. In it we described a vast variety of scientific results underpinning the significant impacts of solar activity fluctuations on climate. Leading climate scientists suddenly saw their CO2-dominant view threatened and so they launched an all out onslaught against the solar theories.For one or two of these IPCC-climate warriors the overreaction has since then perhaps even become a bit embarrassing. Over the past years it has become increasingly clear that the role of the sun on climate has long been underestimated. Recent studies show this, and we will point these out at this blog in the days ahead.What’s new on the subject of the sun?In the search for literature the first place to start is at the “Club de Soleil“ website operated by climate scientist Maarten Blaauw of Queen’s University of Belfast. So far in 2015 Blaauw has presented 23 papers – in just the first 8 months alone, and there’s still one third of the year to go. The most recent are two summary papers by David Douglas and Robert Knox appearing in the April 2015 Physics Letters A. The authors found a clear solar signal in ocean temperatures:
Part 1:
The Sun is the climate pacemaker I. Equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures
Equatorial Pacific Ocean temperature time series data contain segments showing both a phase-locked annual signal and a phase-locked signal of period two years or three years, both locked to the annual solar cycle. Three such segments are observed between 1990 and 2014. It is asserted that these are caused by a solar forcing at a frequency of 1.0 cycle/yr. These periodic features are also found in global climate data (following paper). The analysis makes use of a twelve-month filter that cleanly separates seasonal effects from data. This is found to be significant for understanding the El Niño/La Niña phenomenon.
Part 2:
The Sun is the climate pacemaker II. Global ocean temperatures
In part I, equatorial Pacific Ocean temperature index SST3.4 was found to have segments during 1990–2014 showing a phase-locked annual signal and phase-locked signals of 2- or 3-year periods. Phase locking is to an inferred solar forcing of 1.0 cycle/yr. Here the study extends to the global ocean, from surface to 700 and 2000 m. The same phase-locking phenomena are found. The El Niño/La Niña effect diffuses into the world oceans with a delay of about two months.”

There’s a discussion of the two papers at WUWT.
In April 2014 The Hockey Schtick site pointed out that accumulated solar energy is possibly a far better approach for a comparison to the temperature curve. This can be attributed to the climate system’s huge inertia. You can plot here on your own. The result is amazing.
Also very interesting is a Chinese paper from June, 2014, made public by the Science China Press with the following press release:
Has solar activity influence on the Earth’s global warming?
A recent study demonstrates the existence of significant resonance cycles and high correlations between solar activity and the Earth’s averaged surface temperature during centuries. This provides a new clue to reveal the phenomenon of global warming in recent years.
Their work, entitled “Periodicities of solar activity and the surface temperature variation of the Earth and their correlations” was published in CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN (In Chinese) 2014 No.14 with the co-corresponding authors of Dr. Zhao Xinhua and Dr. Feng Xueshang from State key laboratory of space weather, CSSAR/NSSC, Chinese Academy of Sciences. It adopts the wavelet analysis technique and cross correlation method to investigate the periodicities of solar activity and the Earth’s temperature as well as their correlations during the past centuries.
Global warming is one of the hottest and most debatable issues at present. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) claimed that the release of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases contributed to 90% or even higher of the observed increase in the global average temperature in the past 50 years. However, the debate on the causes of the global warming never stops. Research shows that the current warming does not exceed the natural fluctuations of climate. The climate models of IPCC seem to underestimate the impact of natural factors on the climate change, while overstate that of human activities. Solar activity is an important ingredient of natural driving forces of climate. Therefore, it is valuable to investigate the influence of solar variability on the Earth’s climate change on long time scales.

This innovative study combines the measured data with those reconstructed to disclose the periodicities of solar activity during centuries and their correlations with the Earth’s temperature. The obtained results demonstrate that solar activity and the Earth’s temperature have significant resonance cycles, and the Earth’s temperature has periodic variations similar to those of solar activity (Figure 1). This study also implies that the “modern maximum” of solar activity agrees well with the recent global warming of the Earth. A significant correlation between them can be found (Figure 2). As pointed out by a peer reviewer, “this work provides a possible explanation for the global warming”.

In August 2014 Maliniemi and colleagues described in the Journal of Geophysical Research a relationship between winter temperatures of the northern hemisphere and sunspot cycles:
Spatial distribution of Northern Hemisphere winter temperatures during different phases of the solar cycle
Several recent studies have found variability in the Northern Hemisphere winter climate related to different parameters of solar activity. While these results consistently indicate some kind of solar modulation of tropospheric and stratospheric circulation and surface temperature, opinions on the exact mechanism and the solar driver differ. Proposed drivers include, e.g., total solar irradiance (TSI), solar UV radiation, galactic cosmic rays, and magnetospheric energetic particles. While some of these drivers are difficult to distinguish because of their closely similar variation over the solar cycle, other suggested drivers have clear differences in their solar cycle evolution. For example, geomagnetic activity and magnetospheric particle fluxes peak in the declining phase of the sunspot cycle, in difference to TSI and UV radiation which more closely follow sunspots. Using 13 solar cycles (1869–2009), we study winter surface temperatures and North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) during four different phases of the sunspot cycle: minimum, ascending, maximum, and declining phase. We find significant differences in the temperature patterns between the four cycle phases, which indicates a solar cycle modulation of winter surface temperatures. However, the clearest pattern of the temperature anomalies is not found during sunspot maximum or minimum, but during the declining phase, when the temperature pattern closely resembles the pattern found during positive NAO. Moreover, we find the same pattern during the low sunspot activity cycles of 100 years ago, suggesting that the pattern is largely independent of the overall level of solar activity.”
And finally we present a paper by Nicola Scafetta appearing in the Elsevier journal Physica A in November 2014: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications. It is a discussion of a paper by Gil-Alana et al. whereby the authors claimed solar activity fluctuations had no impact on climate. However there is indeed a relationship that is in fact more complex than that assumed by Gil-Alana and colleagues. The Abstract of Scafetta‘s discussion:
Global temperatures and sunspot numbers. Are they related? Yes, but non linearly. A reply to Gil-Alana et al. (2014)
Recently Gil-Alana et al. (2014) compared the sunspot number record and the temperature record and found that they differ: the sunspot number record is characterized by a dominant 11-year cycle while the temperature record appears to be characterized by a “singularity” or “pole” in the spectral density function at the “zero  ” frequency. Consequently, they claimed that the two records are characterized by substantially different statistical fractional models and rejected the hypothesis that the Sun influences significantly global temperatures. I will show that: (1) the “singularity” or “pole” in the spectral density function of the global surface temperature at the “zero” frequency does not exist—the observed pattern derives from the post 1880 warming trend of the temperature signal and is a typical misinterpretation that discrete power spectra of non-stationary signals can suggest; (2) appropriate continuous periodograms clarify the issue and also show a signature of the 11-year solar cycle (amplitude ≤0.1°C), which since 1850 has an average period of about 10.4 year, and of many other natural oscillations; (3) the solar signature in the surface temperature record can be recognized only using specific techniques of analysis that take into account non-linearity and filtering of the multiple climate change contributions; (4) the post 1880-year temperature warming trend cannot be compared or studied against the sunspot record and its 11-year cycle, but requires solar proxy models showing short and long scale oscillations plus the contribution of anthropogenic forcings, as done in the literature. Multiple evidences suggest that global temperatures and sunspot numbers are quite related to each other at multiple time scales. Thus, they are characterized by cyclical fractional models. However, solar and climatic indexes are related to each other through complex and non-linear processes. Finally, I show that the prediction of a semi-empirical model for the global surface temperature based on astronomical oscillations and anthropogenic forcing proposed by Scafetta since 2009 has, up to date, been successful.”

"Carbon markets could play a crucial role in delivering promises made at the Paris climate conference.  The idea behind carbon markets is simple. A government issues a limited number of permits, which companies can then trade in return for the right to emit a certain amount of the pollutant. As companies scramble to obtain these permits in the carbon market, the price adjusts. High demand for permits will drive up price, and vice versa. Carbon is measured by the tonne emitted and, crucially, all companies within a particular country face the same price. Carbon markets are already in use in Europe, Korea, seven Chinese provinces and cities, and several US states among other places. More are in the pipeline with China, the world’s largest emitter, planning to start a national market in 2017. Yet most existing markets operate independently of each other. European permits cannot be used in the US, and Korean companies cannot trade emissions with firms in China. This is a missed opportunity. If companies in different markets were able to trade, they could make savings every time the price of permits varied across markets. This sort of linkage between markets has quietly been receiving increased attention. Prior to the UN summit in Paris last December, the G7 group of countries launched the Carbon Market Platform. The Paris Agreement itself contains important provisions for the use of linked markets. We recently analysed the potential cost savings when previously isolated markets are linked. Our study examined how four key factors determine whether linking carbon markets, what we call carbon dating, is worth it. So, what does make a good carbon date? Carbon markets will experience ups and downs due to booms and recessions, say, or weather fluctuations that affect demand for permits.  We found that opposites attract. A country prefers the demand in its partner’s market to be more variable (it changes over time) and inversely related to its own (my demand is up when yours is down). This makes the gains from trading larger.  We find that the smaller market in any match tends to benefit most from cost savings. So a very large market such as China has little incentive to link up with a smaller place such as South Korea. In practice, the most mutually beneficial links are likely to be between countries (or other jurisdictions such as the EU) of a similar size, particularly if these markets are subject to different economic fluctuations. This doesn’t mean that links between large and small markets can’t happen. There is, after all, a big incentive for smaller markets to court larger ones. But in these cases the larger market may make certain demands of the smaller.  Taxes on international permit transactions are not unheard of. These change the size and split of the cost savings that can be made. Fewer permits are traded and the benefits become smaller. But such a tax can be tolerated and it may be worth sticking with a partner in spite of it. It might not be ideal, but it’s usually better than staying single. Negotiating the partnership, harmonising market rules and setting up a platform for international transactions is complicated work, and no link will make economic sense if these upfront costs are too high. Conversely, if the costs are negligible, both partners will be better off. This is likely the reason why negotiations between the EU and China have barely started whereas those between the EU and Switzerland have successfully concluded.  Where the picture isn’t so clear, our analysis highlights other possibilities. For example, when upfront costs are shared according to size, the larger partner may prefer not to link even when linking makes sense in aggregate.  These factors are important in theory but are they relevant in reality? We used data from China, various European countries, the US power sector, and the international aviation sector to model how each would benefit from wider carbon credit trading. We found the benefits of links between “large and similar” markets can be dwarfed by those between “small but different” markets. So instinctive decisions – such as trading with a large partner, or your neighbour – can actually end up having costly consequences. For instance, under a few strong but not outlandish assumptions, it may appear to make sense for the international aviation sector to partner with the US because the latter is so large. But in our analysis it would make more sense for the aviation sector to partner with Korea, in part because they are so different from one another. Carbon dating has lots of potential, and could prove vital in encouraging countries and companies to reduce emissions cost-effectively. But, as our research shows, partnerships are far from a straightforward prospect. Finding a good date, it turns out, is never easy."

Secretary Kerry would like to have the public believe that the refugee crisis from Syria and Africa is due to man-made climate drought in the region – and not his abject foreign policy debacle.

 Chart shows Nigeria has been too wet. Source Weatherbell. 
At the 2:34 mark Joe shows a precipitation chart for western Africa which clearly depicts how rainfall has in fact been above average over the past 15 years, and thus drought cannot be cited as a reason for the Boko Haram terror group. Bastardi says:
There’s no drought here. And so you cannot blame drought in Nigeria for the rise of Boko Haram.”

The above chart’s blue shows that it’s been too wet in Nigeria, and not too dry. Indeed there are number of scientific papers showing that the Sahara region has been getting greener over the past 30 years.
In the Middle East Bastardi shows that the drought has hit part of Turkey, but that most of Syria has had normal precipitation, and explains that “drought” is the normal climate condition there. At the 4:20 mark the Weatherbell meteorologist puts up a precipitation chart for the Middle East for the last five years:

The chart above shows more wet (blue) than dry (yellow/green) with Syria being completely normal. Joe shakes his head at how anyone could even make the claim that Kerry does:
What’s really interesting about all this is, this is just so easy to disprove. […] So I don’t understand why that was said.”
Most readers here do understand why. The falsehood was said because US foreign policy has been a total catastrophe in that region, and now Kerry is desperate for any excuse. And he couldn’t have picked a lamer one. In real life any company or employee blaming poor performance on climate change would be immediately shown the door. This is a blatant unwillingness to accept any responsibility.
The nonsense of climate change leading to terrorism excuse is so clear on so many fronts that it’s a wonder than anyone with even a few points of IQ would take it seriously.

"The climate crisis is in the spotlight more than ever before. And that means it will probably come up at family events over the holidays. The daily stream of climate news is unavoidable. Scientists are issuing warnings about the dangerous trajectory of rising temperatures. Weather disasters are increasingly being linked to human-caused changes to the climate. And national-level Democrats are making the climate disruption a top campaign issue.  So we consulted five experts about how they navigate climate discussions with relatives and friends who see the world differently. We synthesized their advice below: Almost all of our interviewees agreed that Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners may not be the best venues for these talks.  “Value the person and the relationship over political ideology or opinion,” said Sarah Hunt, a conservative clean energy policy specialist who is co-founder of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy, a “cross-partisan” organization. She said if a person’s climate posture is clearly a product of political tribalism, “it may be best to agree to disagree”. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, said: “1. Talking is the most important thing we can do and it does make a difference! 2. Not arguing the science with dismissive Uncle Ted, but connecting the dots to why it matters to us and what we and other people are already doing to fix it.” She elaborated on her top tips in a recent webinar. Assume the other person’s best intentions, and seek to understand rather than persuade. Practice active listening: repeat back what you think someone said to make sure you understand. Lori Brewer Collins is founder and executive director of Cultivate the Karass, an organization that aims to bring people of different political viewpoints together to elevate dialogue and find solutions to complex problems. Collins said one Thanksgiving discussion is unlikely to change minds. “What’s more likely to shift is if I empathically really hear your worldview, what it’s like where you come from, play it back and forth with you … and then maybe ask some questions about your worldview,” Collins said. At the Guardian, we have a policy of using the words “climate crisis” to describe the changes to the planet that are putting human lives at risk. We have concluded this is the most accurate term for communicating what is happening to a broad readership. But that doesn’t mean our way is the best way to talk to every person in every context. Experts suggest that depending on your audience, you may want to avoid using the words “crisis”, “emergency”, “movement,” and “revolution”. Susan Joy Hassol, director of the group Climate Communication, said conservatives are more likely to want to maintain the opportunities they have had and to build on them for their children, while progressives are more likely to want broad, systemic change. One area of common ground she recommends is green energy. Kimberly Lewis, senior vice-president at the US Green Building Council and an Apostolic church minister in Maryland, said she focuses on shared values when talking climate with her family, who is from the southern US and includes mixed-race families. “We’re always polarized in our views,” Lewis said. “I try to tell them this isn’t a political conversation. This is a responsibility from our values and our foundation as faith leaders to hold people personally and individually accountable that their actions and decisions always affect the neighbor and the community.” People relate to other people more than they relate to facts. Tell the stories of those impacts by the climate crisis. Pull from reporting you’ve read or talk about people you know. If you personally have been affected by climate change – in losing a home to flooding or suffering with more heat waves, for example – tell your own story. Just explaining the risks associated with the climate crisis can overwhelm people. Hunt suggested some points she thinks most people can agree on. In her words: An innovative, clean tech economy brings jobs and affordable energy. Clean air means fewer children with asthma and fewer premature deaths. Helping our neighbors who are losing their homes to wildfires and flooding is good and right. Don’t spout statistics or cite the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – unless your relatives are Vulcans. “The social science and the psychological research show that people aren’t really persuaded by facts, logic and reason,” Hunt said. “[Most of us] are persuaded by emotion.” You don’t have to be an expert. Talk about what you do understand, and be open to not being able to answer every question."
"There is a sense of haunting to the roar of a lion veiled in darkness. The emphatic “ooooaa!” demands attention as it starts in the abdomen and reverberates through the night air. Its direction and distance are secondary to one’s primordial reaction – a sudden dilation of the pupils and a flare of prickles on the neck. The call unmistakably announces a large carnivore, yet as each roar fades into solitary grunts it feels less like an act of aggression than the lonely imploring of a lost soul in the darkness. The plight of Africa’s lions is lamentable. Since the 1960s, the world has lost at least 70% of these magnificent cats, which until a few thousand years ago inhabited most of Europe, Asia and the Americas. Now we’re down to around 20,000, all of them in Africa apart from one sub-species in India. Habitat loss and the encroachment of people are largely responsible – lions in Kenya and Tanzania are shot by wildlife officials if they consistently kill livestock, for instance. And trophy hunters still shoot lions in the wild every year in countries where it is permitted, including Tanzania and Zimbabwe.  But if you were expecting a fable in which cunning Human steals from noble Lion, this story is not so clear-cut. Living with these predators is not easy. For many people in rural Africa, livestock pay for school fees and hospital bills, and insure against misfortune. Imagine finding half your nest egg has been taken overnight and, worse, worrying your family might be next. Unsurprisingly, many lions that live near people end up shot or poisoned. Yet it doesn’t have to be this way. A new five-year study that I have been involved in shows that when people directly benefit from lions, they become more tolerant of their faults.  We focused on an area surrounding the Mara National Reserve in Kenya, a protected zone at the northern extent of the Serengeti ecosystem. These fertile grasslands are the home of the Maasai, semi-nomadic pastoralists who share them with the great annual migration of over a million wildebeest and their predators, including lions.  Maasai have always speared any rogue that dares interfere with their livestock; and today there are far more people and livestock and much less space for lions. Yet many on the northern edge of the Mara have wisely noted the premiums that tourists are prepared to pay for the Serengeti experience.  Lions help attract over 350,000 visitors to the area every year, generating $90 million (£63 million) in entrance fees alone. Beyond the national reserve, many families have combined landholdings into community conservancies which welcome visitors for a fee. They attract wildlife by managing and protecting resources such as livestock, water and unique habitats; and they distribute income fairly around the community to avoid feuds. Other families have declined this opportunity, relying purely on their livestock for income. Hence there is a 1,500sqkm patchwork of conservancies and other privately owned pastureland to the north of the Mara National Reserve. Together with the reserve itself, where no one lives and lions can roam freely, it amounts to a perfect three-way natural experiment to investigate the effects of conservancies on lions. Lead author Sara Blackburn and Laurence Frank, a veteran predator biologist, spent five years observing the lifespan of 382 lions in the area. This is the first time anyone has looked at the survival rates of individual lions in relation to conservancies, rather than just counting them.  The natural life expectancy of a lion living in the wild rarely exceeds 13 years. When we compared the survival of lions living outside national parks, our results consistently showed that survival is not determined by how many prey are available or the quality of the habitat – there are enough of both to sustain this population. The number of livestock in a lion’s territory makes no difference either.  The only factor that consistently cuts short a lion’s life, sometimes lowering the chances of survival by as much as 40%, is the number of homesteads in its territory that are not part of a community conservancy. Homesteads that are members of a conservancy, on the other hand, have no negative effect on lions’ survival chances. This suggests that when people receive income from lions via ecotourism, they become tolerant and lions survive. There is a good chance that the same would also be true for other animals that are declining across the region, such as giraffe and impala. Cecil, the lion shot by an American hunter last year, drew a line in the sand regarding the public’s opinion on conservation of this remarkable predator. These events have sparked heated debates about the role of trophy hunting and using fences to protect lions in the wild, even while recent footage of an agitated lion walking the streets of Nairobi highlights the continued struggle for space.  In this worrying context, our research points to how this story can end more happily. Community conservancies are a viable and working alternative to protecting wildlife. Although they exist in many parts of Kenya and Tanzania, we must continue encouraging governments to develop similar opportunities for local communities to benefit from wildlife through ecotourism. Evidence such as ours gives reason to be optimistic that community conservancies will continue to expand and benefit human and lion alike.

"Retired trawlerman Armand Toms runs his finger along a knee-high mark on the diesel tanks used to refill the 50 or so fishing and tripping boats moored in Looe’s harbour in south-east Cornwall. “The sea got up to here in 2014,” says the 65-year-old, before raising his hand towards the top of the tanks. “If we get a metre more by the end of the century – is anything going to survive here?” Toms, an independent councillor, who represents Looe East on Cornwall council, has seen the town flood throughout his life. But now he fears for its very future because the frequency with which the sea spills over the top of the harbour walls and bubbles up through its mine-waste foundations is increasing year-on-year. “I’ve lived with storms all my life. When I was 12 or 13, I’d be out on fishing boats in all kinds of weather,” he says. “But it floods more now because of the ferocity of the storms we get.” Looe has the dubious accolade of being the most frequently flooded town in the country. According to the Environment Agency, the historic centre of low-beamed inns, old fishermen stores and merchant houses typically floods four to eight times a year, putting at risk more than 200 properties on every occasion. Yet the agency estimates the town’s plight will get worse as rising global temperatures increase sea levels and whip up ever more devastating storms, with the centre expected to flood 14 times a year in 2020 and 60 times a year in 2050. Steve Marks, who oversees much of the Environment Agency’s work in Looe, says the town runs the risk of flooding every time there is a spring tide, which happens twice a month. “The sea reaches the top of the quayside walls on a spring tide and when you get a storm as well, the water comes over,” he says, gesturing towards the narrow lanes that slope into the old town. “And we know climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of storms.” These existential threats are not confined to Looe. The British coast is crumbling into the sea at an accelerating rate, with huge chunks of cliffs and beaches being swept away in storms each winter. According to the Committee on Climate Change, sea levels around Britain could rise by at least a metre over the lifetimes of today’s children. Yet smaller coastal communities such as Looe only qualify for limited government funding for flood defence, which is targeted at more densely populated areas. Councils are expected to look to private businesses to make up shortfalls. But the environmental food and rural affairs select committee found this year that it has become increasingly difficult to attract such contributions, with only £50 million secured from private sector sources since 2015. “The money that is available for schemes in small places like Looe falls quite far short of what is actually needed,” says Marks. It is not just housing at risk when a place suffers from repeated flooding – the economic impact of a fast-changing coastline cannot be underestimated. In the warmth of Looe’s harbour office, Tina Hicks, the town’s first female harbour master, is busy preparing the accounts for the port, including its fish market, which sees more than £1.5m worth of fresh fish landed on the Cornish coast sold to restaurants in London and other cities every year. She says the floods disrupt the market and could ultimately force it to close: “We are getting dirty flood water coming up through the drains. I’ve got photos of people paddling to get to the market – it happens all the time.” Hicks worries that flooding could eventually drive tourists and shops away, with 22% of businesses already considering their long-term future in the town, according to the council. “At the moment we are a vibrant community but we are struggling,” she says. “You go out and mop up after each flood, but you get to a point where you think: how many more times can this be done?” Environment Agency engineers have drawn up four schemes to protect the town over the last 20 years but none have been implemented due to lack of funds. This year Cornwall council backed a new plan to build a tidal gate but the £41m project would only be entitled to £3.7m of government funding. Other stretches of the Cornish coast are similarly threatened. Up to 100 properties around the county’s rugged coastline are currently at imminent risk from coastal erosion with this figure rising to 1,600 by 2050 and 4,500 by 2100. There are more than 30 communities – including popular resorts such as St Ives, Newquay and Bude – at risk from flooding and erosion. The council calculates it would cost £330m to safeguard its shoreline, which is the longest in the country. But it can only raise £61m under the government’s flood defence and coastal erosion funding system, leaving the council with a £269m funding gap to fill. Rob Nolan, Cornwall council cabinet member for the environment, says this is “well beyond” the means of the authority, which has cut £350m over the last 10 years and needs to cut spending by another £70m over the next four years. “We have a total population of half a million spread over a 75-mile peninsula that sticks out into the Atlantic and takes every storm that is coming,” he says. “Frankly we feel abandoned.” You mop up after each flood, but you get to a point where you think: how many times can this be done? Nor is there any dedicated government funding to help people living in the most at-risk properties to relocate further inland. “What are we supposed to do if we cannot afford to defend these communities or move them out of harm’s way?” says Nolan. “We’ve been put in an impossible position.” The government has allocated £1.2bn for coastal erosion and sea-flooding schemes between 2015 and 2021. This might sound like a lot, but the Environment Agency estimates in its draft flooding strategy, which will be finalised under a new government next year, that the country will need to spend at least £1bn a year on both river and sea defences over the next 50 years. On the east coast – where cliffs composed of soft layers of silt, clay and sand are eroding at one of the fastest rates in Europe – councils in less populated areas cannot afford to upgrade sea defences or enable residents to move away from danger. Among the most severely affected places is Hemsby in Norfolk. Seven homes had to be demolished last year when cliffs collapsed into the sea, and seven were destroyed during the most powerful storm surge in 60 years in 2013. Adrian Phelan,46, lives next door to the house in Hemsby where he grew up from the age of 12. When his family moved to the area in 1984, there were three rows of houses ahead of them and they couldn’t even see the sea. Now it is an ever-present threat. “Our particular plot was cheap because there was no sea view. There was a colossal set of sand dunes. Now it is lapping perhaps four metres away from the road. Once that slides in, the subsidence means that all 50 of us living behind are doomed,” he says. The council has not been able to allay his fears that he and his 68-year-old mother, who still lives in the family home, might be left penniless. “If nothing is done then we will be bankrupt,” he says. “It is stressful to the point of medical issues. I was in hospital last year with chest pains. I hadn’t slept for days after having meeting after meeting about the situation with all kinds of agencies.” Coastal Partnership East – which was set up by Great Yarmouth borough council, North Norfolk district council and East Suffolk council in 2016 to manage their coastline from Holkham to Landguard Point – estimates the long-term solutions for Hemsby could cost between £13m and £30m but the village would only be eligible for £3m of government funding. Karen Thomas, head of the partnership, says it is frustrating that she cannot do more to help those at risk in Hemsby. “We are working very closely with the community to find something that will slow down the erosion. But even the cheapest options are multimillion-pound projects,” she says. Just as in Cornwall, Thomas cannot afford to put in place a so-called “roll back scheme”, where councils purchase and demolish vulnerable homes while building replacements inland. “Our biggest challenge is that people might lose their homes this winter,” she says. “The coastal act says local authorities can buy homes but we don’t have the money to buy someone’s property at a value where they can move on.” The partnership estimates it would cost £150m over 10 years to upgrade and improve all the existing defences along the coastline of Norfolk and Suffolk. However, it would be unlikely to secure anywhere near that amount from the government. “It certainly wouldn’t be half of that money,” says Thomas. She has particularly struggled to find private backers for schemes to protect poorer communities without major private assets. “We need to do some very big projects in Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft to protect them,” she says. “But it is difficult to raise partnership funding from deprived areas – they don’t have industries and businesses.” Similarly, Cornwall has also failed to make up the gap. “We haven’t got big enough industries,” says Nolan. Yet there have been a few eye-catching schemes financed by the private sector. In September, Dutch engineers completed an ambitious project to better protect a gas terminal on a fast-eroding stretch of the Norfolk coast with a vast artificial sand dune, made up of 1.8 million cubic metres of sand dredged from the North Sea. The terminal’s two operators, Shell and Perenco, paid two-thirds of the £19m bill for the scheme, which is only the second of its kind anywhere in the world. The Environment Agency and local councils paid the rest. The new dunes are expected to safeguard the terminal as well as hundreds of homes in Bacton and Walcott for 15 to 20 years. The engineer who came up the idea, Jaap Flikweert, says it gives residents the opportunity to prepare for coastal change. “This is about buying time. That coast is going to continue to erode but there is another decade or two for the government to come up with better ways to adapt.” Flikweert, who works for Dutch engineering giant, Royal HaskoningDHV, said working with nature is much more effective than putting up traditional concrete defences, which can to lead to increased erosion further down the coast. He is pleased with his creation but wishes he could help other threatened communities in the UK. “There are many places on the coast where we know houses will be lost. Some would benefit from sand-scaping schemes but under the current rules it is not always possible to piece together the funding you need,” he says. His team have identifiedabout 20 potential locations including sites in Lincolnshire, Cornwall and Suffolk. However, none have funding in place yet. The most advanced discussions are taking place in Cornwall, where the council would like to use sand-scaping to secure the future of Mount’s Bay, which is named after the iconic St Michael’s Mount. Dave Watkins, Cornwall council’s flood and coastal resilience lead, is keen on replicating the Norfolk scheme yet baulks at the likely price tag of £20m to £30m. “We have done some work for the short term to give us breathing space in Mount’s Bay,” he says. “We are following Bacton very closely because we want to do a similar scheme here. But I don’t know where the funding is going to come from.” On north-west edges of Wales an even more fraught human drama is playing out – one that could well be repeated elsewhere as the century reaches its midpoint. Fairbourne, a much-loved village of 461 properties, with about 700 residents, is set to be decommissioned and possibly returned to a saltmarsh because it cannot be defended against rising sea levels. A masterplan drawn up by the Gwynedd council and Welsh government reveals that in 36 years the council will seek to relocate residents before leaving whatever remains of their homes to be washed away by the sea when the defences protecting the village stops being maintained in 2055. The masterplan, which finished its consultation period in November, warns that a failure in the defences “could result in total inundation of the village, with substantial risk to life and major economic damages”. Yet the council says there is no funding to either resettle residents or pay for an equity-release scheme to allow homeowners to move. Rob Williams, Gwynedd council’s flood risk manager, says the authority cannot afford to rehouse the residents on its own: “We are talking in excess of £40m [to rehouse residents], but as the lead local flood authority we get a grant from the Welsh government of £75,000.” Just below the sea wall, Angela Thomas, the clerk of the local community council, lives with her partner, Mike Thrussell, 64, an angling journalist. Their home dates from around the time Victorian flour merchant Arthur McDougall built the resort in the late 1890s. Thomas, 67, who has been busy organising meetings for alarmed residents, says people in the village are getting on with life as best they can, but below the surface there is growing despair and anger. “There are a huge number who are feeling anxious. They are depressed. They are full of angst,” she says. “It is awful.” The villagers feel abandoned by the authorities. “I really want to see how this country is going to deal with its first so-called climate refugees because at the moment we are getting nothing,” adds Thrussell. The Welsh government said it supported Gwynedd’s masterplan for Fairbourne, stressing that investment continued to be provided for the maintenance of defences: “A policy of managed realignment, such as the case in Fairbourne, does not mean the complete withdrawal of support.” The Environment Agency said that flood defence investment takes place where the risk is highest, wherever it is across the country. “Each scheme is carefully considered to where it will benefit the most people and property,” said a spokesperson. Back on Looe’s quayside, the town’s harbourmaster, Tina Hicks, is contemplating what will happen to her home town over the rest of the century if the latest plan fails to secure enough funding. “It’s heartbreaking but I don’t think that people will want to live here or invest here,” she says, glancing out of the window at all the potters, netters and trawlers rising with emerald green tide. “You’ll end up with a shanty town by the sea.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterUPDATE: Some have been claiming that I’m on a so-called paleo-diet. But that is not accurate. I guess I may be on something that resembles to a significant extent a paleo-diet, but it is not. I eat a fair amount of dairy products, which cavepeople didn’t eat. I thought the following was interesting: http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-paleo-diet-has-it-wrong-cavemen-did-eat-carbs-2015-08-18.
==================================
Something totally different today, but I think it will surely benefit some readers here who are not yet aware. If it changes the life of just one person, then it’s worth it.
Many readers know that I changed my diet some 15 months ago – as a result of a paper that was published last year and a video DirkH posted in a comment.
In a nutshell, all the national dietary guidelines promoting the low-fat, high-carb diet (yes, all endorsed by a universal medical scientific consensus) have been dead wrong for decades. In turns out that saturated fat, meat and eggs are in fact not dangerous – rather they, and many other often demonized foods, are in fact healthy and essential for good health.
You can’t go anywhere today without seeing suffering
So what has been the result of our modern, western enlightened populations being fooled decades long into thinking that low-fat, high-carb diet is healthy? Just look around you. Today we are seeing an unprecedented, mass-scale epidemic of heart disease, obesity, diabetes and cancer. You can’t go anywhere without seeing people in public who are dragging themselves around and suffering immensely. Sadly many children are now severely afflicted.
Today I am convinced that at least half of the pharmaceutical industry owes its existence to this decades-long nutrition disinformation, one that I believe they have been actively complicit in promoting. A lot of executives and doctors should have been locked up long ago.
Tens of billions made with Viagra
Many readers here are grown men, and so I thought this site and the excerpts that follow would interest them. There’s nothing to buy here – it’s free information – and I agree with the dietary recommendations they make 100%. Big Pharma does not want you to know it. They want to pump you up with statins, beta blockers, Viagra, anti-depressants, etc. etc. etc.
So gentlemen, here you go. The site writes:
1. “Losing body fat, especially belly fat, is a primary method for increasing testosterone naturally.”
Losing fat is easy. Simply switch to a high-fat, low-carb diet. Carbs make you fat, and not fat. See below.
2. Strength training gives you many benefits: stronger muscles; a higher metabolic rate; a leaner body; and a higher testosterone level. Exercising large muscle groups has been shown, through studies, to increase your testosterone levels.”

Moreover:
3. “…you’ve been inundated with misinformation about cholesterol and fat. A testosterone-friendly diet will seem to fly in the face of everything you’ve heard from your doctor, the federal government, the American Heart Association, and every magazine health article written for the past four decades. …your doctor, the federal government, the American Heart Association and every magazine health article is wrong. Your body produces all the cholesterol you use, and the bulk of what you eat goes straight through you.
Here’s another shocker: fat DOES NOT make you fat. Because everyone purporting to be a diet expert has said, ad nauseam, to restrict your calories, fat has gotten the same bad rap as cholesterol. Fat is higher in calories, per serving, than most foods; however, your body NEEDS high quality fat to be healthy.”
Saturated fats are not the Devil’s spawn, either; naturally saturated fats are necessary for your body to produce hormones, and these hormones are necessary for proper metabolic processes to occur.”
The next one is the toughest, but is very important: Stay away from “healthy whole grain” bread!
4. “The tinkering with genetics has led to some bad side effects, with the worst one being the grains make you overeat. Also, a high-carb diet is usually high in processed carbs, so they are death to your blood sugar and a ticket to type II diabetes.”
The site summarizes:
5. “These methods of natural ways to boost testosterone will increase your health overall, and give you back the energy you had when you were in your teens and twenties, as well as giving you back your libido.”
I’ve received some e-mails from some readers who told me of the vast improvements in health they have seen since they’ve changed their nutrition, and I think they will second me on all this. My diet, which now consists mainly of Kerrygold butter, cheese, eggs, meats, vegetables berries, fruits, etc. (and very little in the way of grains) has led me to lose the 20 lbs of excess weight I had been carrying around, my blood pressure to be back to normal, and my energy levels to multiply. So all the claims made at the linked site all ring true.
Give it a try. Not only will you appreciate the immense health improvements, but so will your better half.

"Is the Anthropocene real? That is, the vigorously debated concept of a new geological epoch driven by humans.  Our environmental impact is indeed profound – there is little debate about that – but is it significant on a geological timescale, measured over millions of years? And will humans leave a distinctive mark upon the layers of rocks that geologists of 100,000,000AD might use to investigate the present day? Together with other members of the Anthropocene Working Group we’ve just published a study in Science that pulls much of the evidence together.  The case for the Anthropocene might be distilled into five strands: Carbon is important, both due to its growing impact on global warming and because it leaves long-lived geological traces. The increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere – now higher than at any time in at least the past few million years – can be found as fossil bubbles in the geologically short-lived “rock” that is polar ice.   But there are wider and more long-lived traces too, in the form of changed patterns of carbon isotopes (absorbed by every living thing) and in tiny, virtually indestructible particles of fly ash released from furnaces and chimneys. These are leaving an indelible signal in rock and soil strata now accumulating. Other chemical cycles have been even more greatly perturbed. There is now about twice as much reactive nitrogen at the Earth’s surface than in the past, courtesy of the Haber-Bosch process used in the fertiliser industry, while the amount of phosphorus at the surface has also doubled. This is changing the biology and chemistry of environments ranging from far northern lakes to the growing ocean “dead zones” found along polluted coasts. The artificial radionuclides released by atom bomb explosions are (for now) environmentally trivial by comparison – but they have also left a distinct and measurable marker worldwide. Human ingenuity and industry are creating thousands of new materials that wouldn’t exist without us, from compounds now harder than diamond to plastic, which has seen extraordinary growth from negligible pre-World War II to something like 300m tons a year today.  Many of these materials take a long time to wear out, and they’ve been very widely disturbed across the planet. Almost nowhere is safe. Even most mud samples taken from remote ocean beds now contain plastic fragments. Buried in sediment, these materials may be preserved over geological timescales, forming new rocks and rapidly-evolving “technofossils” for our descendents to marvel at. The rate of extinctions is now many times above background levels, and is accelerating.  But arguably of yet greater significance, currently, to modern biology – and hence to future palaeontology – is the unprecedented redistribution of plant and animal species between continents and across oceans.   This homogenisation of life on Earth is being increasingly joined by human-directed evolution of living species in agriculture, to create entirely novel biological assemblages such as broccoli or maize, which don’t exist in nature. The changes are comparable in scale to those of earlier epochs. The extraordinarily wide range of geological signals associated with the Anthropocene – many of them new to the history of this planet – means comparison with earlier epochs is not straightforward. But putting the evidence together indicates an overall magnitude of change at least as large as that which ushered in the Holocene, our current geological epoch, and most other epochs. Hence, there is a solid basis for considering that the Anthropocene – especially if defined as beginning in the mid-20th century – is real within the context of our planet’s history.   This doesn’t necessarily mean the term will be formalised anytime soon. Other arguments come into play in the debate, and some widely-used geological time terms such as the Precambrian (the planet’s first four billion years) still don’t have an official definition. But it does mean that humans are moving the Earth system from the comparative environmental stability of the Holocene into a new, evolving planetary state. And the impact will be felt by all human generations to come."
"It’s official: 2015 was the warmest year on record. But those global temperature records only date back to 1850 and become increasingly uncertain the further back you go. Beyond then, we’re reliant on signs left behind in tree rings, ice cores or rocks. So when was the Earth last warmer than the present? The Medieval Warm Period is often cited as the answer. This spell, beginning in roughly 950AD and lasting for three centuries, saw major changes to population centres across the globe. This included the collapse of the Tiwanaku civilisation in South America due to increased aridity, and the colonisation of Greenland by the Vikings. But that doesn’t tell the whole story. Yes, some regions were warmer than in recent years, but others were substantially colder. Across the globe, averaged temperatures then were in fact cooler than today. To reach a point when the Earth was significantly warmer than today we’d need to go back 130,000 years, to a time known as the Eemian. For about 1.8m years the planet had fluctuated between a series of ice ages and warmer periods known as “interglacials”. The Eemian, which lasted around 15,000 years, was the most recent of these interglacials (before the one we’re currently in).  Although global annual average temperatures were approximately 1 to 2˚C warmer than preindustrial levels, high latitude regions were several degrees warmer still. This meant ice caps melted, Greenland’s ice sheet was reduced and the West Antarctic ice sheet may have collapsed. The sea level was at least 6m higher than today. Across Asia and North America forests extended much further north than today and straight-tusked elephants (now extinct) and hippopotamuses were living as far north as the British Isles. How do we know all this? Well, scientists can estimate the temperature changes at this time by looking at chemicals found in ice cores and marine sediment cores and studying pollen buried in layers deep underground. Certain isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in ice cores can determine the temperature in the past while pollen tells us which plant species were present and therefore gives us an indication of climatic conditions suitable for that species.  We know from air bubbles in ice cores drilled on Antarctica that greenhouse gas concentrations in the Eemian were not dissimilar to preindustrial levels. However orbital conditions were very different – essentially there were much larger latitudinal and seasonal variations in the amount of solar energy received by the Earth.  So although the Eemian was warmer than today the driving mechanism for this warmth was fundamentally different to present-day climate change, which is down to greenhouses gases. To find a warm period caused predominantly by conditions more similar to today, we need to go even further back in time. As climate scientists, we’re particularly interested in the Miocene (around 23 to 5.3 million years ago), and in particular a spell known as the Miocene-Climate Optimum (11-17 million years ago). Around this time CO2 values (350-400ppm) were similar to today and it therefore potentially serves as an appropriate analogue for the future.  During the Optimum, those carbon dioxide concentrations were the predominant driver of climate change. Global average temperatures were 2 to 4˚C warmer than preindustrial values, sea level was around 20m higher and there was an expansion of tropical vegetation.  However, during the later Miocene period CO2 declined to below preindustrial levels, but global temperatures remained significantly warmer. What kept things warm, if not CO2? We still don’t know exactly – it may have been orbital shifts, the development of modern ocean circulation or even big geographical changes such as the Isthmus of Panama narrowing and eventually closing off – but it does mean direct comparison with the present day is problematic. Currently orbital conditions are suitable to trigger the next glacial inception. We’re due another ice age. However, as pointed out in a recent study in Nature, there’s now so much carbon in the atmosphere the likelihood of this occurring is massively reduced over the next 100,000 years."
"What does making a house “energy efficient” actually mean? We know it’s important: homes account for around a quarter of total energy consumption, and most of this is used for heating and hot water. So anything you can do to reduce usage will help your bottom line. Efficiency programmes range from the provision of low energy light bulbs to whole-house retrofitting. As researchers in the field, the one question we are always asked is: “If I do this, how much energy will it save?” To which we give the helpful answer: “It depends”. There is lots of advice out there, after all, and the media, charities and local authorities all provide guidance. But just how much of it is based on real scientific evidence? A common piece of advice is to turn your thermostat to 21°C to ensure an energy efficient and comfortable home. However, work by my colleagues and I found older thermostats can easily vary by up to 2°C, meaning we could actually be heating our homes to anything between 19°C and 23°C. If we consider the Energy Savings Trust’s advice that reducing home temperature by 1°C could save 10% on heating bills, then this discrepancy has implications. Often, when a home is made more energy efficient, people simply decide to absorb the savings – in both money and heat – by keeping their houses warmer. Energy consumption may even increase. This is known as the “take back effect”, or Jevons Paradox. In the UK, this effect accounts for an average of 35% of the initial saving, although individual homes may be more extreme. This further confounds the predicted models that the improvements may have been sold on. Perhaps the most contentious reason for efficiency improvements not performing as designed is simply down to poor design or installation. Wall insulation could be missing, windows could be poorly fitted, or the actual materials used could be different from those dictated in the original design. Research on new build homes has found this “performance gap” can make these buildings less than half as efficient as they were supposed to be.  To investigate these gaps, paradoxes and myths, colleagues and I established the Salford Energy House. Essentially it’s an entire terraced house, built from brick to traditional British housing standards, but constructed within a climate controlled chamber. This allows us to manipulate the weather to be anything from -12ºC to +30ºC or as rainy and windy as we like.  Given we know exactly how the house was built, how it is “used” (by our researchers), and the “weather” it is exposed to, we can get a very good idea of how efficient it is. When we add curtains, better thermostats or other improvements, we can compare results with those from the original, unimproved house and try to find the difference. Our tests are extensive, detailed and give us data that would be impossible in the field – no actual homeowner would want nearly 300 sensors attached to their house.  And what did we find? We added living room thermostats and thermostatic radiator valves and established energy savings of over 40% when compared to a property with no controls. We identified that curtains reduce heat transfer through the windows by about 30% when closed. When we retrofitted the whole house with floor insulation, solid wall insulation, loft insulation and new glazing, the annual heating costs were reduced by a huge 63%. However, if we are questioned as to how much a particular action or improvement will make to a homeowner, it still “depends”. This is because every home and family is different: some people are home all day, some people are rarely in; others, such as those who have chronic illnesses, need different internal temperatures to those who don’t.  Closing your curtains may save lots of heat, but the number and type of windows, location of radiators, and when they are opened or closed will greatly influence this saving on an individual home. Houses come in all sorts of sizes, shapes and levels of efficiency, particularly in the UK, where we are fond of our older, energy inefficient housing stock.  We can give guidance based on data, but when it comes down to an individual home there will always be confounding variables that might mean actions or improvements will not perform as expected. Even in our energy house, where we can compare one action or improvement against another to a high level of detail, we are really only able to give a miles-per-gallon perspective – much of it will depend on your car and how you drive."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt his Klimazwiebel website, Hans von Storch, a climatologist for more than 40 years and a director of the Institute of Coastal Research for over 20 years, writes of how last June at a symposium in Nottingham he was asked to comment on his view of the role of science in society. 
A dean of German climate science, von Storch has long been a vocal critic of a cabal of climate scientists who are venturing beyond their fields and attempting to seize the role of deciding policy for society. He maintains that scientists are simply not qualified to run the world, even though many have deluded themselves into thinking that they are. Lately a limited group of climate scientists have been demanding a rapid and radical transformation of global society.
Von Storch warns that science is always on the verge of error: “Scientific knowledge represents a resource for the public, in making-sense of complex developments and perspectives, in decision making.” He also says that science must always “be prepared to revise its understanding when new observations arrive, or if contradictions in the present understanding are unveiled“.
He warns against dismissing those who challenge science: “Attempting falsification is a necessary step to add plausibility of scientific knowledge”. 
He warns of the consequences of abusing science to promote personal agendas: “…by renouncing attempts of falsification, by failing to implement the scientific method (and norms a la Merton), by using the knowledge for the promotion of specific societal interests, this capital science is spent“.
Von Storch says scientists should not venture beyond their fields because in truth they are “Fachidioten” [nerds], a German term for “narrow specialists, i.e. nerd”, and that scientists should not let their arrogance get the best of them. He says these nerds “know their narrow field particularly well; their understanding of other fields, which are also of great importance for a societal problem, {but that it] is as good as that of as any hairdresser, taxi-driver and journalist“.
The veteran German climatologist reminds us that scientists are also just normal citizens and so they “should not use the capital of science as an argument supporting own preferences“. He describes an environment where some scientists are abusing their status and how the public “is getting ‘resistant’ to the cacophony of newest scientific claims that this-or-that catastrophic development if this-and-that is not done“.

He says there is a need for “improving the relationship between science and policy” and that science needs to be “re-scientized” and policy needs to be “re-politicized”.
On the role of science in society, Hans von Storch writes
Science is supposed to provide best explanations of complex developments, independent if these explanations support one political preference on another. Policy, on the other hand, is supposed to take decisions, with all consequences for all aspects of the real world, which are acceptable for the public – in terms of values, preferences, and perceptions.”
In other words, scientists, like everyone else, have the right to express their opinions on issues, but they must avoid actively deciding policy, and threatening terrible consequences if policymakers decide otherwise.
At the end von Storch says “Different scientific quarters provide constraints for different components of the real world. Eventually, however, political decisions are balancing societal preferences and values, and the role of science is and must be limited“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman website wobleibtdieglobaleerwaermung (WBDGE) here reports some autumn halftime statistics for Central Europe. It turns out that earlier predictions by Germany’s Deutsche Wetterdienst DWD for a warm fall have been shattered so far, just the latest in a string of blunders we’ve been witnessing from the DWD.
The WBDGE site tells us:
After an already cool September, an historic cold wave with snow reaching into the flatland during the first half of October saw mean temperatures in parts of Germany clearly well below the 30-year mean as the following chart shows:”

Source: www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/composites/day/. Hat-tip: WBDGE. 
Back in September Germany’s DWD Weather Service had forecast October in Germany to be “warm”. However so far the exact opposite has been the case. This is in part the result of the deeper than expected cold spell that just occurred.
How cold was it? Wetteronline.de here reports that some places saw all-time record lows for the date. The site writes:

On Wednesday winter started at what may be a record early date. At times a blanket of snow formed in the lowlands. At some locations it was colder than ever recorded since temperature records began.
On Wednesday new record low temperatures were set across a large region. In the west the thermometer showed high temperatures of only 5°C. At some locations, such as Cologne and Essen, it was the coldest since records began back in 1881. From Thuringia, across western Saxony, and down into northern Bavaria high temperatures reached only 1 – 3°C.
Björn Alexander blames 2015 cold on 2012 Arctic ice extent!
Comically the unexpected extreme cold had parts of the German media scrambling to explain it, blaming it all global warming. For example meteorologist Bjorn Alexander of German NTV public television site here said the cold was due to the widespread Arctic ice cap melt – of 2012! NTV tells its readers:
Why such cold days in times of climate change? As absurd as it may sound: Especially because of global warming Europe will see record breaking cold more often. That is increasingly so because of greater ice melt in the Arctic. Models show: The less sea ice there is in the Arctic, the more probable it is that a high forms up there and brings cold to Europe.”
The link he provides, however, takes the reader to the 2012 record low sea ice extent, and not this year’s sea ice extent – which is now close to a 10-year high for this time of the year. Alexander also seems to be unaware that the models he refers to were slapped together by red-faced PIK scientists after the cold winters began hitting Europe back in 2009. These models have since been dismissed by a number of scientists and meteorologists
Temperatures in Central Europe are expected to moderate in the days ahead. However, recent GFS models show that winter maybe returning by the end of the month. See here.

"With more people than ever living in cities, how do we reconcile our need for fresh fruit and vegetables with the challenges of life in an urban environment where the time and space for gardening are limited? Thankfully, there are many ways to grow your own fresh produce in the city, which go beyond the traditional solution of the allotment. Here are just five: Here’s proof that you can grow food in the smallest and most urban of settings. Window farming allows you to grow plants vertically inside your house or flat with the roots resting in water with added nutrients, a system called hydroponics. There’s no need for outdoor space or even any soil.  These “farms” can be as complex or simple as you like and there are now more than 45,000 window farmers around the world collaborating to find new ways of growing food.  At its most basic, guerrilla gardening involves the cultivation of land that you have no legal right to use. As such, it’s about much more than growing fruit and veg, since projects tend to have broader aims to do with reclaiming public space and transforming derelict or neglected parts of the urban landscape.  At its best, it is a creative and inspiring example of direct action. Think of “seed bombs” used to transform a demolition site into a haven for pollinating insects, or lavender and sunflowers being added to a traffic island under cover of night. Unlike allotments, community gardens are focused on doing things together with others. They’re perfect for people who don’t have the time or skills required to work an allotment on their own, and the the camaraderie of working together and learning from more experienced gardeners provides huge social benefits beyond the food they produce.  So-called “CSA” projects are still relatively new in the UK but the idea behind them is simple: to create a direct connection between farmers and consumers and take back control of the food system from supermarkets and large corporations. Some schemes are similar to existing veg box delivery services where you simply pay to sign up and receive regular vegetable deliveries in return.  However, others allow you to be much more than just a “consumer” as you spend time working on the farm in exchange for produce. In this way, you can get some fresh air and exercise while learning new skills and meeting like-minded people. From the farmer’s perspective this also means a guaranteed market and extra help on the farm. Interested? You can find your local scheme here.  Do you like the idea of finding your own food but you’re not keen on gardening? No problem. If you know where to look, urban areas also offer plenty of opportunities to find good food for free.  Parks, cemeteries and neglected canal towpaths often offer lots of edible species, from the relatively common blackberry and elderberry to more unusual tasty treats that you can use to spice up your meals. For example, hedge garlic – or Jack by the hedge – can be a fantastic addition to salads, while hawthorn berries and crab apples can make a fabulous jam. Of course, you need to be careful about possible contamination or misidentification but, if you’re unsure, why not see if your city has a forage walk that you can join? That way, you can learn first-hand about what’s safe to eat.  Shops, supermarkets and restaurants also throw out lots of perfectly edible food every day. An increasing number of people are foraging in bins for bread, tinned beans or even beer. This hunt for ready-made food is known as “skipping” or “dumpster diving”. Like many of the other methods described here, it’s not just a means of feeding yourself but a political act that highlights the wastefulness of the global food system."

===================================
The sun drives climate: 11-year cycles shown in natural climate archives
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
Solar activity fluctuates in sync with a series of characteristic cycles. The most well-known of these is the 11-year Schwabe cycle. Naturally, 11 years are a relatively short time with respect to climate. Due to the inertia of the climate system, large climatic impacts cannot be expected from these short cycles. Yet it is still worthwhile to take a closer look. A series of appearing papers over the past years has looked into the Schwabe cycle and searched for a possible climate coupling in historical datasets. The search was fruitful: the solar Schwabe cycle has a measureable impact, and one that should not be underestimated.
We’d first like to start in Germany. Here a team of scientists led by Dominik Güttler of ETH Zürich studied 100-year old oak trees from the Medieval Warm Period in South Germany. Using C14 dating and counting tree rings, the scientists were able to find a clearly pulsating 11-year cycle. The paper appeared in January 2013 in the Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Accelerator Mass Spectrometry. The abstract:
Evidence of 11-year solar cycles in tree rings from 1010 to 1110 AD – Progress on high precision AMS measurements
Oak tree rings from Southern Germany covering the AD 1010–1110 years have been analyzed for radiocarbon with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) at the laboratory at ETH Zurich. High-precision measurements with a precision down to 12 years radiocarbon age and a time resolution of 2 years aimed to identify modulations of the 14C concentration in tree ring samples caused by the 11 years solar cycles, a feature that so far is not visible in the IntCal calibration curve. Our results are in good agreement with the current calibration curve IntCal09. However, we observed an offset in radiocarbon age of 25–40 years towards older values. An evaluation of our sample preparation, that included variations of e.g.: chemicals, test glasses and processing steps did not explain this offset. The numerous measurements using the AMS-MICADAS system validated its suitability for high precision measurements with high repeatability.”
The next stop is Italy in the Ionian Sea. Researchers there as well found the 11-year solar cycle in the climate archives of the last 2700 years. The study was published in March 2015 in the journal Climate of the Past. The abstract:
A high-resolution δ18O record and Mediterranean climate variability
A high-resolution, well-dated foraminiferal δ18O record from a shallow-water core drilled from the Gallipoli Terrace in the Gulf of Taranto (Ionian Sea), previously measured over the last two millennia, has been extended to cover 707 BC–AD 1979. Spectral analysis of this series, performed using singular-spectrum analysis (SSA) and other classical and advanced methods, strengthens the results obtained analysing the shorter δ18O profile, detecting the same highly significant oscillations of about 600, 380, 170, 130 and 11 years, respectively explaining about 12, 7, 5, 2 and 2% of the time series total variance, plus a millennial trend (18% of the variance). The comparison with the results of multi-channel singular-spectrum analysis (MSSA) applied to a data set of 26 Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature-proxy records shows that NH temperature anomalies share with our local record a~long-term trend and a bicentennial (170-year period) cycle. These two variability modes, previously identified as temperature-driven, are the most powerful modes in the NH temperature data set. Both the long-term trends and the bicentennial oscillations, when reconstructed locally and hemispherically, show coherent phases. Furthermore, the corresponding local and hemispheric amplitudes are comparable if changes in the precipitation–evaporation balance of the Ionian sea, presumably associated with temperature changes, are taken into account.”
In April 2014 Liang Zhao and Jing-Song Wang of the Peking National Center for Space Weather reported in the Journal of Climate on another Schwabe finding. The authors studied fluctuations in the east Asian monsoons and here too were able to see a clear influence by the 11-year solar cycle. The abstract of the paper:
Robust Response of the East Asian Monsoon Rainband to Solar Variability
This study provides evidence of the robust response of the East Asian monsoon rainband to the 11-yr solar cycle and first identify the exact time period within the summer half-year (1958–2012) with the strongest correlation between the mean latitude of the rainband (MLRB) over China and the sunspot number (SSN). This period just corresponds to the climatological-mean East Asian mei-yu season, characterized by a large-scale quasi-zonal monsoon rainband (i.e., 22 May–13 July). Both the statistically significant correlation and the temporal coincidence indicate a robust response of the mei-yu rainband to solar variability during the last five solar cycles. During the high SSN years, the mei-yu MLRB lies 1.2° farther north, and the amplitude of its interannual variations increases when compared with low SSN years. The robust response of monsoon rainband to solar forcing is related to an anomalous general atmospheric pattern with an up–down seesaw and a north–south seesaw over East Asia.”

Two months ago a team of researchers led by Zhongfang Liu published a study on the North American winter climate in the journal Environmental Research Letters. Surprisingly the scientists found a strong impact by the 11-year solar cycle, which in part has an influence on the climate of the North American winter via the Pacific circulation system. Abstract:
Solar cycle modulation of the Pacific–North American teleconnection influence on North American winter climate
We investigate the role of the 11-year solar cycle in modulating the Pacific–North American (PNA) influence on North American winter climate. The PNA appears to play an important conduit between solar forcing and surface climate. The low solar (LS) activity may induce an atmospheric circulation pattern that resembles the positive phase of the PNA, resulting in a significant warming over northwestern North America and significant dry conditions in the Pacific Northwest, Canadian Prairies and the Ohio-Tennessee-lower Mississippi River Valley. The solar-induced changes in surface climate share more than 67% and 14% of spatial variances in the PNA-induced temperature and precipitation changes for 1950–2010 and 1901–2010 periods, respectively. These distinct solar signatures in North American climate may contribute to deconvolving modern and past continental-scale climate changes and improve our ability to interpret paleoclimate records in the region.”
In the conclusion they write:
Our results have shown the influence of the 11year solar cycle on the PNA associated atmospheric circulation pattern and winter surface climate in North America.”
Also in the Bering Sea a team of scientists showed the impacts of the solar Schwabe cycle. Kota Katsuki and his colleagues found the cycle in the climate archives of 13,000 years ago. That study appeared in April 2014 in the Geophysical Research Letters:
Response of the Bering Sea to 11-year solar irradiance cycles during the Bølling-Allerød
Previous studies find decadal climate variability possibly related to solar activity, although the details regarding the feedback with the ocean environment and ecosystem remain unknown. Here, we explore the feedback system of solar irradiance change during the Bølling-Allerød period, based on laminated sediments in the northern Bering Sea. During this period, well-ventilated water was restricted to the upper intermediate layer, and oxygen-poor lower intermediate water preserved the laminated sediment. An 11-year cycle of diatom and radiolarian flux peaks was identified from the laminated interval. Increased fresh meltwater input and early sea-ice retreat in spring under the solar irradiance maximum follow the positive phase of Arctic Oscillation which impacted the primary production and volume of upper intermediate water production in the following winter. Strength of this 11 year solar irradiance effect might be further regulated by the pressure patterns of Pacific decadal oscillation and/or El Niño-Southern Oscillation variability.”
Last but not least we have a classic paper on the Schwabe cycle by a group led by Hiroko Miyahara in 2009 appearing in the Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union:
Influence of the Schwabe/Hale solar cycles on climate change during the Maunder Minimum
We have examined the variation of carbon-14 content in annual tree rings, and investigated the transitions of the characteristics of the Schwabe/Hale (11-year/22-year) solar and cosmic-ray cycles during the last 1200 years, focusing mainly on the Maunder and Spoerer minima and the early Medieval Maximum Period. It has been revealed that the mean length of the Schwabe/Hale cycles changes associated with the centennial-scale variation of solar activity level. The mean length of Schwabe cycle had been ~14 years during the Maunder Minimum, while it was ~9 years during the early Medieval Maximum Period. We have also found that climate proxy record shows cyclic variations similar to stretching/shortening Schwabe/Hale solar cycles in time, suggesting that both Schwabe and Hale solar cycles are playing important role in climate change. In this paper, we review the nature of Schwabe and Hale cycles of solar activity and cosmic-ray flux during the Maunder Minimum and their possible influence on climate change. We suggest that the Hale cycle of cosmic rays are amplified during the grand solar minima and thus the influence of cosmic rays on climate change is prominently recognizable during such periods.”
===========================================
If the 11-year cycle already has an impact, then just imagine the profound impact that the other loner term cycles have, such as the 78-year cycle and the 1000-year solar cycle. These surely cement the climate into longer term phases. -PG

"Whether dubbed “climate extremes” or “global weirding”, we have been witnessing some surprising and concerning weather events. In Europe, seasons seem to be changing, but not consistently. Since the turn of the millennium, the UK in particular has experienced record-breaking summer heatwaves, extraordinary rainfall in different seasons, and winters extreme in both warmth and cold. Something seems wrong, and we don’t have a complete understanding of what is going on. In 2003, much of western Europe endured the hottest summer on record and July 2006 was the hottest month ever recorded in England – both periods were defined as heatwaves.  From 2007 onwards, the UK ran into a sequence of relatively cool, wet summers, with exceptional rainfall and widespread flooding in 2007 and 2012. Winters have been likewise variable. Mild winters dominated the 2000s until a sequence of two remarkably cold and snowy seasons in 2009-10 and 2010-11. The epic stormy winter of 2013-14 then saw destructive waves at coastlines around the western UK and record rainfall in southern England.  Most recently, in late 2015, the UK experienced exceptionally mild conditions, accompanied in November and December by record-breaking rainfall and devastating floods. December 2015 was the warmest on record in central England (these records date back to 1659, and also smashed previous records in Germany and Switzerland. This coincided with exceptional December warmth along the East Coast of the US with cities like New York and Boston experiencing their warmest Christmas on record. Many of the above are warm weather events, the sort you might expect to happen more frequently thanks to our changing climate. However, the extent to which standing records have been shattered – in such a short space of time – is astounding. This suggests some sort of regional effect may have amplified the extremes experienced around the North Atlantic. So what’s behind all this extreme weather? Some have sought links to changes in the Arctic, in the tropics, or in solar activity. And all of these do influence the “jet stream” high in the atmosphere that guides and drives weather over Europe and North America.  But there’s a more local factor: temperature patterns in the North Atlantic. To appreciate the extent and speed of recent changes, consider these maps of some recent sea surface temperature anomalies. Since our climate has warmed, the anomalies are calculated relative to a “new normal” – average conditions over the millennium to date (2000-15), rather than earlier cooler times. This emphasises the recent warm-cool swings. We’ve witnessed striking changes. The winter of 2009-10 saw the development of a classic “tripole” pattern comprising positive (warm) anomalies in the tropics and subpolar latitudes, sandwiching negative (cool) anomalies in between. The temperature anomalies were clearly established by the end of that winter, in March 2010. This well-known pattern disappeared at the ocean surface through summer 2010, but persisted beneath the waves and re-emerged in the early winter of 2010-11. The “tripole” partly explains the UK’s record low temperatures and snowfall during those two winters, by helping to establish weaker low and high pressure centres around Iceland and the Azores respectively. With this change in pressure pattern, the UK is more dominated by cold Arctic and Eurasian air. Very different conditions unfolded through winter 2013-14. By March 2014, a “cold patch” had developed in the Atlantic south of Greenland. It proved resilient. The cold patch again survived summer and not only re-emerged but remarkably intensified through last year, peaking in August, and persisting into November and December of 2015. In fact, across the two hottest years on record, that region of the Atlantic has stood out for actually being colder than usual. This has a big knock-on effect elsewhere. The cold patch may have displaced and invigorated the jet stream and exposed the UK to a flow of mild and moist Atlantic air from the south-west, which links it to the very unusual recent weather. It’s not just the UK, either. These changes in the Atlantic coincided with extremes across eastern North America and Europe – those warm Christmases – though other influences, such as the current El Niño, are clearly important too.  It’s too early to say how much the Atlantic may have influenced strange weather elsewhere, but anomalous warmth in the western subtropics and the Gulf of Mexico late last year is also noteworthy, and may be linked to those balmy conditions in the eastern US. Changes in weather extremes are both breathtaking in scale and serious in consequence. And it’ll get worse before it gets better. Despite agreements aimed at limiting global warming to 2°C, we still face dangerous climate variability. As shown in the maps above, rapid “unseasonal” temperature fluctuations already often exceed 1-2°C across large regions of the North Atlantic. So as the world warms, we are carefully monitoring our oceans, and how they are interacting with the atmosphere – this is key to a better understanding of extreme weather and seasonal predictions. There has never been a more important time to get to grips with our volatile climate."
"In cities, the air, surface and soil temperatures are almost always warmer than in rural areas. This effect is known as the Urban Heat Island – a term which first came into use in the mid-20th century. Until the 1980s, this effect was considered to have relatively little practical significance. In fact, given that most studies were done in cities with cold winter climates, a warmer temperature was seen as a potential benefit, because it reduced the need for heating. But since then, we’ve found a number of reasons to be concerned.  For one thing, it became clear that the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect of cities was influencing air temperature records, which are used to assess climate change. In other words, it became important to remove urban “contamination” from weather station records to ensure their accuracy.  What’s more, as populations in warm and hot cities have increased, so too has the demand for indoor cooling – typically met by air conditioning. This even applies in colder climates, where changing building uses has increased the demand for cooling; for example, in office buildings, to offset the heat generated by computers.  In these situations, the UHI adds to the heating burden: ironically, cooling buildings with air conditioners increases outdoor air temperatures.  Heatwaves have the power to kill; for example, during the 2003 heatwave in Europe, 70,000 additional deaths were recorded, making it one of the region’s deadliest natural disasters of the last 100 years. The UHI makes city dwellers more vulnerable to the dangerous effects of extreme weather events like this.  The potential medical impact is perhaps the most significant issue related to UHI,  especially against the backdrop of continued climate change and global warming. For all these reasons, it’s crucial to understand how the UHI works, so that we can find ways to mitigate and adapt to its effects.  The UHI is strongest during dry periods, when the weather is calm and skies are clear. These conditions accentuate the differences between urban and rural landscapes. Cities are distinguished from natural landscapes by their form: that is, the extent of the urban land cover, the construction materials used, and the geometry of buildings and streets. All of these factors affect the exchanges of natural energy at ground level.  Much of the urban landscape is paved and devoid of vegetation. This means that there is usually little water available for evaporation, so most available natural energy is used to warm surfaces. Construction materials are dense, and many – particularly dark-coloured surfaces like asphalt – are good at absorbing and storing solar radiation.  Meanwhile, the shape and positioning of buildings in the city slows the movement of air near the ground, creates complex patterns of shade and sunlight and limits natural energy exchanges. Urbanisation is also associated with the emission of waste heat from industry, transport and buildings, which contributes directly to the UHI.  There are, however, different types of UHIs, with different dominant causes. “Surface UHI” refers, unsurprisingly, to warmer urban temperatures at the Earth’s surface. Typically, this type of UHI is measured using satellites with a plan view of the city, so that the temperature of roofs and roads (but not walls) can be measured. From this perspective, the surface UHI is highest during the daytime, when hard urban surfaces receive solar radiation and warm quickly.  Another type of UHI is based on observations of air temperature, which are made close to the ground; in the city, this means placing the instruments below roof height. This UHI is usually strongest at night, as street surfaces and the adjacent air cool slowly. Above the roof level, the contributions of streets and building roofs together warm the overlying urban atmosphere. In some conditions, this warming can be detected up to 1km to 2km above the surface.  The geography of the UHI is relatively simple – it’s magnitude generally increases from the urban outskirts towards the city centre. However, it also contains many micro-climates – for example, parks and green spaces appear as cool spaces. The UHI is an inevitable outcome of the landscape changes that accompany urbanisation. But its magnitude and impacts can be managed by modifying some physical aspects of our cities. This can include increasing vegetative cover and reducing impermeable cover; using lighter coloured materials, designing urban layouts to allow for better ventilation through the streets and buildings, and managing urban energy use.  Of course, these solutions need to be tailored to the type of UHI. For example, a focus on building cool or green roofs will have an impact on the overlying air and the top floor of buildings, but may have little impact on the UHI at street level. Similarly, trees may be an effective means of providing street shade, but if the canopy encloses the street, then it can trap traffic emissions, resulting in poor air quality.  As a first step, many cities have completed UHI studies to identify the “hot-spots”, where design interventions could have greatest effect. But what most cities need is a coherent climate plan, which addresses interrelated environmental issues including flooding and air quality, as well as surface and air temperatures."

"For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. COP stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC, and the annual meetings have swung between fractious and soporific, interspersed with moments of high drama and the occasional triumph (the Paris agreement in 2015) and disaster (Copenhagen in 2009). This year is the 25th iteration. Delegates started arriving last night for the two-week summit. This year’s COP has already needed a last-ditch rescue. Costa Rica wanted to host the event but lacked the resources, so Latin America’s richest per-capita economy – Chile – took control. Everything was set for a December COP in Santiago, billed as “the blue COP” because at long last issues about the oceans would take centre stage. But rioting in the capital and a political crisis forced the COP to be moved. The Spanish government – despite being in the throes of a general election – stepped up and offered Madrid, where this year’s talks will now take place. The abrupt change of venue has caused many headaches, not least for the young campaigner Greta Thunberg, who had to hitch a lift back across the Atlantic by boat. There will be less opportunity for Latin Americans to showcase their vital role in reducing emissions, and Brazil may escape some of the attention on its recent moves to exploit the Amazon rainforest. It also means the conference will be scaled down, with room for fewer NGOs and businesses. Activists and protesters are hurriedly gearing up to make public pressure felt, and participants are hoping that the act of rescue will focus minds and lead to a spirit of cooperation. World leaders will not be turning up, though appearances by VIPs and celebrities cannot be ruled out. The negotiations, which run until 13 December, will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations. The COPs, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which can be frustrating and means some countries – notably Saudi Arabia – can act as a drag on more ambitious action, but gives COP decisions global authority. Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty and no country has yet opted to withdraw from it. That includes the US, which is in the process of withdrawing from the Paris accord. Under the landmark 2015 agreement, nations committed to holding global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels. The vast majority of nations have now ratified the deal. Though the deal is legally binding, the commitments that countries have made to cut their emissions are not. These are known as nationally defined contributions which will have to be ratcheted up next year if the aims of Paris are to be met. So far, the US has played a low-key role in the UN climate process under Donald Trump, but that could change to more damaging obstruction. “As in years past, the US plans to send an interagency delegation. The US delegation will engage in negotiations to protect US interest and level the playing field for US businesses,” the state department said. Other potential obstructors include big oil powers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and Venezuela, as well as Brazil and Bolivia. Key to progress at COP are China, the world’s biggest emitter, and India, whose emissions are rapidly rising. China has been working hard to cut emissions, not least from the coal-fired power plants that have generated widespread air pollution. But new research from Global Energy Monitor has found that the country has increased its coal-burning capacity by more than 40GW in the 18 months to June, and plans more. Christine Shearer, an analyst at the NGO, said: “China’s proposed coal expansion is so far out of alignment with the Paris agreement that it would put the necessary reductions in coal power out of reach even if every other country were to completely eliminate its coal fleet.” China is also funding the building of new coal-fired power plants elsewhere, including in South Africa, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The main subject up for discussion is a provision in the Paris agreement known as article 6, which allows for the use of a global market in carbon to help countries cut emissions and to fund measures that reduce emissions in developing countries. Carbon markets have been around since the 1997 Kyoto protocol. The broad idea is that rich countries could meet their targets by buying carbon credits that were awarded to projects reducing emissions in the developing world. In this way, rich nations bought themselves time, and poorer nations got cash to help them on the road to a green future. But the mechanism had basic flaws – with too many easy credits devaluing the system. The financial crisis of 2008 led to the outright collapse of the carbon market. It has never fully recovered, and today projects to cut carbon in developing countries are more likely to rely on conventional fundraising or overseas aid. Reviving the carbon markets through article 6 is seen as a worthy aim by many involved in climate finance. Trading could also help raise funds to prevent deforestation. For some campaigners, however, the markets are a scam aimed at allowing rich countries to get away with continuing to burn fossil fuels while paying poor countries to clean up. “We do not have the luxury of talking about carbon offsets, we need absolute emissions cuts now. Offsetting is unacceptable in the face of the scale and pace of emissions reductions required, and we will oppose the creation of a new global carbon market,” says Juan Pablo Osornio of Greenpeace. Nat Keohane, senior vice-president at the US Environmental Defense Fund, and a former US COP delegate, rejects that analysis. “It is about cooperation – markets are cooperation, and they are a pathway to reducing emissions fast,” he says. Cooperation among developed and developing countries is crucial, in his view. By funding, using and sharing technologies and methods of bringing down emissions in the developing world, rich countries are helping solve a crucial part of the global problem. However, he agrees that “no deal on article 6 is better than a bad deal”, and some countries are in danger of undermining the discussions by insisting on rule changes. Brazil, for instance, is accused of seeking double counting of its forests, by being allowed to count its tree cover towards its commitments to cut emissions under Paris, while also seeking to sell to other countries carbon credits received for keeping its forests standing. This sets the scene for a bitter fight over article 6, which would endanger the delicate consensus achieved at Paris, and that must be preserved if countries are to fulfil the aims of Paris by ratcheting up their commitments to bring down emissions. There are far bigger issues hanging over COP, but they will not be decided this year, just hinted at. The biggest alarm is that the aspiration set in Paris to constrain temperature rises will require unprecedented efforts to achieve. But individual country commitments to steer the world towards that best-case scenario were not part of the binding Paris deal, but contained in a non-binding addition. So emissions are increasing again, temperatures are higher than ever, countries are not mandated by law to act – and time is running out: the IPCC concluded that on current rates we have little over a decade to halt emissions growth and bring down carbon rapidly to keep warming within the 1.5C threshold. Current commitments made by national governments under the Paris agreement fall far short of what is required – taken together, they would still condemn the world to an estimated temperature rise of more than 3C by the end of the century. According to the UN’s latest “emissions gap” report, published a few days before the start of this year’s talks, countries must reduce their greenhouse gases by about 7.6% a year for the next 10 years, to stay within the 1.5C limit. Closing that gap will be COP26’s biggest task. Every year, alas. To meet the Paris objectives, it is clear the national targets must be revised upwards, and the deadline for that process is next year – which is also when previous targets, set at Copenhagen, expire for many countries. That makes 2020 a pivotal year for climate action. Arguably the most important function of this year’s COP is to clear the way for the crunch summit next year, the most important meeting on the climate emergency since the Paris agreement was struck in 2015. The past five years have been spent thrashing out the “rulebook” by which Paris would be implemented, in a long series of technical discussions on issues as arcane as how carbon sinks should be accounted for. Those discussions have been necessary to deal with the bureaucratic side of this complex international treaty, but they have not addressed the central issue of what emissions reduction commitments governments are prepared to offer. COP26 will take place in Glasgow, and the UK will be charged with the vital diplomatic role of coaxing countries into the commitments needed – commitments that were so ambitious, compared with governments’ meagre and sometimes reluctant offerings, that they could not be achieved in Paris five years ago. In the years since Paris, new high-carbon infrastructure such as roads, coal-fired power plants and skyscrapers have continued to be built, and new oil and gas fields opened up. In addition, governments in some countries – the US, Brazil and Australia among the major economies – have been elected which are openly hostile to climate action. Indeed. You could argue that three decades of negotiation have produced just one agreement to hold temperatures to a limit that is too high, and we are not even remotely on track to honour that agreement. All the hard decisions in the Paris agreement have been put off to a conference next year that might be a disaster, going on current form. Meanwhile, the Amazon is burning, bush fires are raging in Australia and America, climate chaos is causing a humanitarian disaster every week, and our global plan is to have some more meetings. And yet if we didn’t have this UN process, we’d have to invent it. Without it, the world would be truly adrift and fully at the mercy of individual governments and vested commercial interests. Osornio says: “Whether or not the UNFCCC is adequate isn’t really the point – at the moment, it’s all we’ve got. Without [it], we would have to create another multilateral process for the world to come together and address the global climate crisis. Upholding existing multilateral processes, like the UNFCCC, helps against the rise in nationalism and isolationism already threatening international cooperation.”"
"None of the main parties in the general election has a coherent plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, the biggest source of carbon in the UK, according to Friends of the Earth. The Conservative manifesto highlights the need to repair potholes, but the nearly £30bn pledge to be spent on roads is likely to add to greenhouse gases at a time when they need to be reduced drastically.  Labour and the Liberal Democrats have pledges to invest in rail and other public transport, with Labour doing so through nationalising the railways, but they also fall short. Transport has become the biggest source of UK emissions and is on the increase, rising by 3% a year, while carbon from energy generation has fallen. The Department for Transport has been criticised for “going rogue” by planning for big increases in road transport while neglecting public transport and the need to invest for a low-carbon future. Mike Childs, the head of science at Friends of the Earth, said: “While the Conservatives have warm words on buses and trams, they do not spell out spending commitments, and the £350m they promise for cycling is a fraction of what’s needed. Meanwhile, their promise to spend £28.8bn on roads will exacerbate the climate emergency.” However, despite much more focus on the climate emergency in their manifestos, Labour and the Lib Dems also failed to grasp the opportunities needed, he said. “Labour and the Lib Dems are both much stronger on transport but neither have faced up to the fact that we need to stop spending on roads and make motoring more expensive. Transport is the largest source of carbon emissions and growing – if we are to take the climate emergency seriously, we need carrots and sticks.” A report by Transport for Quality of Life, Friends of the Earthand Greenpeace, prepared before all details of the main parties’ policies were available, has found that the UK could drastically reduce emissions from transport through investment in infrastructure, regulation on emissions from vehicles and encouraging people out of their cars. They found that government departments responsible for all other sectors of the economy, from energy and waste to agriculture and housing, had cut greenhouse gas emissions – but the DfT had presided over a rise in emissions. “A policy prescription for slow and steady carbon reduction that might have been sufficient 25 years ago is no longer fit for purpose,” the authors said. “Because we have left it so late to tackle carbon from transport, we now have to take urgent action.” Under the UK’s current target of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 – a target that would be brought forward by the Lib Dems, Labour and the Green party – the rising emissions from transport would have to be brought under control swiftly. The main parties have differing aims on when to ban the sale of combustion engines, and this will be crucial, according to the report. Theresa May’s government reversed some of the incentives for buying electric cars, resulting in a steep fall in sales. The NGOs are calling for a radical rethink of public transport that would require it to be universal, comprehensive, affordable – or free, in the case of local travel – and low-carbon. They point to examples in other countries where public transport systems are coordinated so that trains, trams and buses are under a single authority. Adopting a similar approach in regions of the UK would cut car mileage by about 10%, the report predicts. The potential for cycliing would be much larger if infrastructure was improved, according to the report. The authors cite a recent study suggesting more than a quarter of commuters in the West Midlands would cycle to work if e-bikes were widely available and the routes more cycle-friendly. The most obvious ways of funding new low-carbon infrastructure are to reallocate existing road transport funding, and to put levies on driving on motorways and some built-up areas and on road haulage. However, the report suggests that methods common in other countries could also be used: for instance, a levy paid by employers to pay for public transport and a small tourist or lodging tax for overnight visitors, common in other European countries, to go towards local public transport. Public expenditure on walking, cycling and local public transport in the UK is about £2.3bn a year. But if all these measures were taken, the expenditure could be raised to £40bn a year, making possible the radical changes needed to the transport system to allow for a low-carbon future, the report found. “The next government should bring in pay-per-mile for driving in towns, cities and on motorways, balanced by free local public transport,” said Lynn Sloman, director of Transport for Quality of Life. “It should regulate all public transport, as in London, and as Manchester is considering, so that every town and city can have a comprehensive public transport service. “There must be a massive increase in funding for bus services, tram lines and cycleways, but much of that can be paid for by cancelling the last government’s £29bn climate-destroying roads programme. The climate emergency should be the top priority of the next transport secretary, and every penny of public money must be used to cut traffic and enable everyone to live decently without having to own or drive a car.” • This article was amended on 3 December 2019 to make it clear that the campaigning group who commented on the party manifestos was Friends of the Earth.

"Last week Coldplay announced they were to stop touring until they were sure it would be carbon neutral; now Massive Attack are partnering with academics to map the carbon footprint of the music industry. The researchers from Manchester University’s Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research will analyse data from Massive Attack’s touring and recording schedule to look at three key areas where CO2 emissions are generated: band travel and production, audience transport and venue.  The aim is to provide information and guidance to the wider music industry so that it can reduce its negative environmental impact in light of the increasing climate emergency. “In an emergency context, business as usual – regardless of its nature, high profile or popularity – is unacceptable,” wrote Robert Del Naja, AKA 3D, Massive Attack’s vocalist, in an article for the Guardian, explaining the collaboration. He said the band had tried carbon offsetting for almost 20 years, paying to have trees planted, prohibiting the use of single-use plastics and travelling by train wherever feasible. But they had come to the conclusion that “offsetting creates an illusion that high-carbon activities enjoyed by wealthier individuals can continue, by transferring the burden of action and sacrifice to others – generally those in the poorer nations in the southern hemisphere”. Del Naja said the band did not want to stop playing big shows or festivals, but that huge change was essential for the planet’s future. “Given the current polarised social atmosphere, uplifting and unifying cultural events are arguably more important now than ever, and no one would want to see them postponed or even cancelled. The challenge therefore is to avoid more pledges, promises and greenwashing headlines and instead embrace seismic change,” he wrote. Dr Chris Jones, a research fellow at Tyndall Manchester, said: “We will be working with Massive Attack to look at sources of carbon emissions from a band’s touring schedule. Every industry has varying degrees of carbon impact to address and we need partnerships like this one to look at reducing carbon emissions across the board. “It’s more effective to have a sustained process of emissions reductions across the sector than for individual artists to quit live performances. It will likely mean a major shift in how things are done now, involving not just the band but the rest of the business and the audience.” The collaboration will produce a framework based on data gathered from Massive Attack’s forthcoming tour. This year, Glastonbury festival banned single-use plastic, and an increasing number of artists are taking steps to reduce their environmental footprint. In an interview with BBC News last week, Coldplay’s frontman, Chris Martin, said the group were waiting to tour their new album, Everyday Life, so they could ensure such a tour was carbon neutral. “Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,” said Martin. “We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral. We’ve done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it’s not so much taking as giving?” The solo artist Billie Eilish’s next tour, in March, will feature the “Billie Eilish eco-village”, where fans can learn about their role in the climate crisis. Those who pledge to fight the climate emergency with the organisation Global Citizen can earn free tickets to the sold-out shows. The 1975 are working towards making their tours carbon-efficient and have pledged to plant a tree for every ticket sold for their UK arena tour in February. The British band have also stopped producing new T-shirts, instead screen-printing a new design over old merchandise stock."

Solar activity in September 2015 / The latest science before the Paris Climate Conference
Guest post by Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt and Frank Bosse
[Translated/edited by P Gosselin]
In September our sun was quite active during its current solar cycle (SC) number 24: The observed sunspot number (SSN) was 78.1. The average for all the previous cycles this far into the cycle is 83.5, and so September of this cycle was 93% of the usual activity.

Fig. 1: Cycle 24 activity (red) compared to the mean (blue) and to the earlier and similar Cycle Number 5.
Comparing the individual cycles to each other:

Fig. 2: The summation of the monthly deviations from the mean value (shown by blue curve in Fig. 1) for each cycle, up to month 82 since the start of the cycle. Cycle 24 started in December 2008.
We currently find ourselves no doubt on the downside of the cycle (see Fig. 1). Very often the cycles do not differ that much from each other. The important negative anomaly from the mean activity was produced already during the first 5 years of its duration.
Some physics before Paris
[Reviewed by Nicholas Lewis]
The big question that beckons to be answered before Paris is: How will the climate develop by the year 2100? What can and should be decided by policymakers so that global warming does not exceed the 2°C limit compared to pre-industrial times over the next 84 years?
At this blog we examined and concluded time and again that the anthropogenic impact on climate has been massively exaggerated by the institutionalized scientists. In any case the uncertainties in the assignment of the anthropogenic climate impact has been poorly considered. Natural factors, such as solar activity, were major factors in the past and will remain so in the future. They not only left a mark with the minimal changes in total solar irradiance (TSI), but it is not appropriate to set the sun’s impact at zero – as the IPCC does – and then assign a massive weight to the anthropogenic effects in the 21st century. For example Schellnhuber in 2009 claimed there is “an extremely simple quasi linear relationship between the global mean temperature and the total CO2 amount that will be emitted into the environment over the next decades”. In the following analysis we will ignore our own doubts and will calculate using the numbers from the IPCC.
Here we use the numbers of the IPCC AR5 on forcing: Read here.
In Table 1.2 the numbers for forcing in W/m² for a variety of factors are given, for example carbon dioxide, other greenhouse gases, land-use, etc.. This year a paper by Stevens was published on this, in which he assigned a new figure to the forcing by aerosols – pegging it at about 50% of what was stated in the a.m. document from the year 2013. We have reported on this on a number of occasions, e.g.: here/.
The relationship between total forcings and the observed temperatures since 1950 assuming it behaves as a linear function of the forcings (the current aerosol correction has been accounted for):

A mean “transformation” of 0.338°C per W/m² of forcing can be read with a significant scatter among the individual annual mean values. Our climate also varies internally, not controlled by the external forcings. That becomes evident when we look at the individual years with their differences from the shown mean value (the residuals):

Fig. 4: The residuals of the individual years, their smoothing using the 11-year Loess-Filter (blue), and the smoothed difference of the ocean heat content (red) of both hemispheres.
The thinner blue line in Fig. 4 depicts special climate events over the past 60 years. Pronounced are the impacts of volcanoes (cooling) in the years 1984, 1985 and 1992-1994 and the 1998 El-Nino (warming). The volcanoes are shown here to be strong deviations from the forcings because these numbers are not sensible for the desired preview (we do not know when and how strong a volcanic eruption until 2100 will be) and the volcanic forcing had little impact on the temperature of a single year in the past during 1950-2014. The volcanic events were concentrated up to 1995, the consideration of the full forcing would inscribe a (negative) bias to the sensitivity of the temperatures versus the forcings. Therefore we omitted this also from the consideration of forcings  from the past.
The ENSO event in the tropical Pacific also will not be considered in the preview because it is a natural internal variability. If one smooths the smaller events with a low-pass filter (bold blue curve in Fig. 4) a long-term pattern emerges. We get hints about its emergence from a paper by a team led by Alexander Ruzmaikin of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. The team works on the hemispheric radiation variability of the earth and has determined that it, among other things, reflects the heat content of the upper 700 meters of the oceans. Also Fig. 4 confirms this as the smoothed deviations from the trend (bold blue) show a large similarity to the interhemispheric difference of the heat content of the world’s oceans (bold red). This, the paper determined in its Figure 7, has its origin foremost in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. There are also many details on this, e.g.: http://www.kaltesonne.de/.

Here our observations of January 2013 are updated.
Back to our question
What can we expect of our climate in the year 2100 if we follow the IPCC’s line of thought and take into account the new findings out since 2013?
From Fig. 3 we read off a climate sensitivity to forcing of 0.338°C per W/m². From Fig. 4 we get a variability of approx. 0.2 °C over the midterm, coming from the Atlantic and non-predictable time-limited spikes of up to 0.3°C in single years. The rise in Fig. 3 comes from almost exclusively the forcing from CO2. From the literature it can also be derived that other forcings (from other greenhouse gases, such as methane, the sun etc.) will remain as a whole in the range of 1 W/m². The IPCC generated scenarios of the irradiative forcing until 2100, except an unrealistic high projection (RCP 8.5), here assume here a more or less solo role for growth by CO2 increase. We now have everything together for making a projection.
An increase of 2°C by 2100 for pre-industrial levels might contain about 0.15°C, (“heat in the pipeline”) stemming from the reduced heat uptake efficiency of the oceans due to their already happened warming. Attaining the 2°C target requires that the global mean temperature can fluctuate about this 1.9°C – 2.1°C value because of natural variability (see Fig. 4). Therefore we use only 1.75 °C ( 1.9 – 0.15°C) which is expected to result through the further CO2 warming. The forcing then is 1.75/0.34 = 5.15W/m². We should reserve 1 W/m² for the remaining forcings outside of CO2, and thus 4.15 W/m² remains for carbon dioxide. This forcing can be calculated back to the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere: approx. 600 ppm would be the limit value allowed in order to reach the 2°C target. That means a doubling of the CO2 share compared to 1900. From today on there remains another 200 ppm over the next 84 years, which means 2.4 ppm/year growth. Over the last 85 years the CO2 content rose approximately 93 ppm. The current mean rise since 2000 is very close to 2 ppm (see www.esrl.noaa.gov/png).
In any case in the second half of the century we have to succeed in slowly bringing the annual CO2 growth rate back to zero by 2100 in order to meet the 2°C target. That is achievable with little trouble. The only requirement is that the 600 ppm level in 2100 should not be exceeded. Also a growth in the forcing by other greenhouse gases over the 1W/m² limit would be counterproductive. This result was also reached in another paper by a team led by Yoichi Kaya of the Research Institute for Innovative Technology of the Earth in Kyoto: http:springer.com/page-1.  The summary of the paper states:
This implies that 2°C target would still be a feasible target.”
Just as the mainstream climate science does, in our derivation we set the prerequisite that the climate system behaves linearly, i.e. that temperature changes respond proportionally to the changes in the forcings. This is unlikely. We reported recently on a paper that described the mechanism for “regulating” temperatures (foremost in the tropics and subtropics). It is also in no way sure that the forcing data of the 2013 AR5 will be valid in a few years time. However, we should and must begin grappling with the big questions somewhere.
Summary
We can summarize: Also with a CO2 increase of the current magnitude over the next 30 years, and accompanied by a gradual decrease in the CO2 growth rate, the 2°C target will still be met – even applying the hypotheses of the IPCC. Continued future technological progress up to 2100 will certainly meet the challenges we face concerning energy shortages, keeping the atmosphere below 600 ppm CO2 content – and thereby preventing excessive warming (think how 85 years ago around 1930 neither computer technology nor modern energy saving machines nor energy production with today’s efficiencies were imaginable) – all this without having to adopt an economic kamikaze program in Paris.

"When walking along the beach, some objects might seem unusual because they are neither pebble nor shell nor seaweed. They can be covered with a soft white layer that looks a bit like cotton wool. They may appear hard or waxy, and sometimes have objects trapped within. And a smell that has been described as “a cross between squid and farmyard manure”. Dogs with their keen sense of smell often find these objects first. If you find one of these, you might hope for ambergris – sometimes referred to as “whale vomit” – as one couple recently reported finding in Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, UK. Described as floating gold, it’s a highly-prized natural treasure used by past kings and still sought after by artisan perfumers. According to reports, this latest could be worth £50,000 (US$71,000) for a 1.57kg lump. So what exactly is ambergris and why does it still cost more than gold or truffles? The reason for the high prize lies in the origin of ambergris. It is a product of the sperm whale, as only sperm whales make the compound responsible for ambergris’ allure: ambrein. Different organisms biosynthesise different compounds, such as caffeine made by cocoa, coffee or tea plants. Ambrein is made by sperm whales only to glue together squid beaks. Squid is the main diet of sperm whales but as the beaks can’t be digested, they need to be passed out without causing injury. They do this by coating them with ambrein. Ambergris starts as a mixture of squid beaks, ambrein and another digestive product called epicoprostanol. Once expelled – usually as faecal matter but also through vomiting, hence the name – ambergris floats in the ocean, turning from a “lump of poo” that smells of faeces into floating gold that has incorporated the varied smells of the sea.  Visually this means ambergris starts more as a black lump and slowly bleaches. This ageing process is suspected to have two chemical effects: the reduction in the scent of faeces, which is more water-soluble and gradualy lost, and the incorporation of the scents of the sea, which is fat-loving and absorbed by the waxy ambergris in the making (much like butter in your fridge takes on the smell of other things). The longer it floats in the sea, the waxier it gets. Considering that not every sperm whale poo includes lumps and that the numbers of sperm whales are much lower these days, it’s clear why this ambergris is so rare. Ambergris has been used in some expensive perfumes as it allows scent to last longer, in part because the ambrein molecule on exposure to a certain type of activated oxygen, creates fragrance compounds that are lighter and are more volatile or smelly, and they may take other volatile molecules present in ambergris with them. But these days perfumiers mostly use synthetic versions. Ambergris was also thought to be an aphrodisiac and a study found found that it acted as a sexual stimulant in rats. Not all that shines is gold, however. Suspect ambergris finders quickly get excited about their discovery. A “hot needle test” is recommended to confirm that it is ambergris – a test and this is where the challenge starts.  Touching the waxy lump with a hot needle should melt it, release white smoke and give off an interesting smell. Let’s consider other substances washed up on the beach that also react positively to this test: candle or paraffin wax, residues from palm oil distillation, rubber, or solidified sewer grease. As far as abundance is concerned, there is much more wax or vegetable oil about compared to ambergris.  Some of these compounds find their way into the sea through pollution: by falling overboard; becoming dislodged from sewer pipes; or discarded elsewhere. All of these waxy substances will be smoothed by exposure to the sea for longer periods of time and bleach. The sea also has a habit of bleaching any object, hence the whiteness of driftwood.  One test for ambergris is to poke it with a hot needle and a liquid should ooze out – try the “hot needle test” with a candle at home. But many waxy objects melt when exposed to heat. As for the white smoke, most objects immersed in water take on some of it. Most wet objects burned give off white smoke, similar to what you might think of coal-fired power stations. And then there is the smell of ambergris – one would expect ambergris to smell unlike anything else smelled before. However, our sense of smell usually works by association. Some may find it revolting, some might start to think it smells like perfume, because they’re thinking of it in that way. I have been sent many samples where the sender referred to the smell as attractive and I found it revolting. With few people having smelled ambergris, then, it’s hard to say whether you’d smell rancid oil or something sweeter. Dogs, on the other hand, are quite attracted to smells we find rancid. Ambergris is rare. Hoped-for ambergris is much more likely to be what you’ve found if you stumble upon that waxy, stinky blob. Increasingly, oil residues, be they derived from petroleum mining, vegetable oil refining or sewers, find their way to our beaches. Marine organisations are keenly aware of this pollution, but not everyone else is, unfortunately. If you do encounter a strange rock that smells unusual, think twice whether the smell is what you would like to put on your body or whether it is more unpleasant. If the latter, it is most likely not ambergris. If still in doubt, send me a sample."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMore people and more wealth, yet less losses. That’s what the latest 2014 disaster statistics tell us. Bad news for the doomsday worshippers and cheerleaders.
The Geneva-Switzerland based International Federation of the Red Cross recently released its 2014 Natural Disaster Report, according to the German online daily BILD here. If anything, the news is very good – with huge drops in losses.
Moreover US hurricane and tornado activity trends since 1950 have remained flat or are decreasing respectively.
A copy of the report’s results is here. The AON Executive Summary writes (my emphasis):
Down Again: 2014 Catastrophe Losses Below Average
Global natural disasters1 in 2014 combined to cause economic losses of USD 132 billion, 37 percent below the ten-year average of USD211 billion. The losses were attributed to 258 separate events, compared to the ten-year average of 260. The disasters caused insured losses of USD39 billion, 38 percent below the ten-year average of USD63 billion and was the lowest insured loss total since 2009. This was the second consecutive year with below normal catastrophe losses. Notable events during the year included major flooding in India, Pakistan, China, and Southeast Europe; billion-dollar convective thunderstorm events in the United States, France, and Germany; winter storms in Japan and the United States; and widespread drought in the United States and Brazil. The top three perils, flood, tropical cyclone, and severe weather, combined for 72 percent of all economic losses in 2014. Despite 75 percent of catastrophe losses occurring outside of the United States, it still accounted for 53 percent of global insured losses, driven by a higher insurance penetration.”
According to the Red Cross data, many of the deaths were due to cold, with 505 alone occurring in one country – Peru! Among the top disasters were brutal winters in the USA and japan – hardly what one would expect from “global warming”.
90% less deaths
A total of 8186 people died in 2014 because of natural disasters. Bild reports: “2014 the number of deaths from natural disasters was almost 90 percent under the 10-year average of 76 500 deaths.” That’s hugely good news, but you’d never know it hearing the media!
Lowest in 10 years
According to the IFRC, in 94 countries there were a total of 317 floods, earthquakes, forest fires, cyclones and a number of other nature events with deaths. “But that was the lowest number in 10 years.“, BILD reports.
But the IFRC report insists that the news is bad no matter what, and warns that the good news won’t last, citing more severe weather events in the future (no date given) because of global climate change.
No Cat 3 hurricane landfall in 9 years
But data show the opposite. For example when it comes to hurricanes, the AON report writes on page 12:
The 2014 Atlantic Hurricane Season marked the ninth consecutive year in which the U.S. did not sustain a major Category 3+ landfalling hurricane, which extends the alltime record by another year. It was also the quietest season in terms of named storms since 1997.”
It’s stunning that some are actually out there screaming things are worse than ever when the opposite is the truth.
One of least active since Doppler radar began

On U.S. tornado activity it’s more of the same, with the AON report stating on page 17:
For the third consecutive year, tornado season in the United States was one of the least active since Doppler radar began being deployed in the early 1990s.”
Here’s the chart of the last 10 years – no change:

Also on page 18 the chart on acres burned by wildfire shows that 2014 was near a decade low:
The Appendix of the AON report also provides more charts on hurricane and tornado trends since 1950. What follows is a chart showing United States hurricane landfalls:

No trends in hurricane landfalls. Source: NOAA IBTrACS historical tropical cyclone database.
Violent tornadoes on the decrease
On violent tornadoes, the AON report writes:

Since 1950, the overall trend of higher-end tornadoes rated at F3/EF3 and above has remained nearly flat and shows a slight annual decrease of 0.8 percent. A comparable 1.2 percent annual decrease is also found when looking at dependable data since the advent of Doppler radar in 1990. When breaking down data to just the last 10 years, there has been a similar nearly flat growth at 0.5 percent.”

Here’s the chart:

Here we can see that violent tornadoes were considerably more frequent from 1950 – 1975 – back in the days of ice age warnings!
So the next time some hysterical alarmists insist weather extremes are getting worse, send the link to the AON report and tell them to look at the data for once.

"In today’s busy online world, our brain’s are constantly stimulated by an onslaught of information. When faced with distractions such as ringing phones, noisy colleagues and floods of incoming emails, focusing on a complex task can be difficult. In fact, many studies have claimed that these multiple demands on our attention are impacting on our ability to concentrate and connect with people. Animals in the wild also face similar challenges. All animals have only a limited amount of attention, and it must be shared between an array of tasks, including locating food, maintaining social bonds and keeping a watchful eye out for both competitors and hungry predators. With increasing levels of man-made noise in the environment, animals are having to contend more and more with external stimuli which can draw their attention away from these key tasks. And the consequences of failing to focus on lurking dangers can be deadly.  Experts have been aware of the distracting effects of noise on aquatic animals for some time. Research has demonstrated that a number of fish and crab species are significantly slower to react to a simulated predator attack when exposed to ship noise. And a recent study on damselfish in Australia showed for the first time that noise exposure directly impacted upon survival by increasing the fish’s susceptibility to predator attacks. However, the “distracted prey hypothesis”, had until now, not been explored in wild mammals. Our experiments involved activating a remote-controlled speaker to broadcast road noise at a colony of prairie dogs. I then played the role of the “predator”, and approached a foraging animal at the centre of the group, to measure how close we would have to be before the prairie dog would become alert and flee. The experiment was conducted under artificial noise and repeated during quiet control periods - building upon our previous research.  Although we expected that the prairie dogs would take longer to respond when distracted by noise, we were surprised by our findings. Unlike the fish and the crabs, in the presence of noise, prairie dogs reacted earlier to the approaching predator and took evasive action more quickly, dashing for their burrows. We saw the same response in almost all our experiments, demonstrating that the prairie dogs were more than capable of attending to risk without being distracted.  Over the course of the experiments, it was also clear that these animals were reacting more quickly. It became increasingly difficult for me to pass by individual prairie dogs close to the trail without triggering loud alarm calling, which rapidly spread to neighbouring animals. But strangely, other nearby humans, such as hikers and cyclists, passed by the same animals and barely triggered even a raised head. These unexpected observations may well be explained by the fact that prairie dogs, despite their small size, have impressive cognitive abilities. Experiments have demonstrated that they can distinguish between different predators (and even human observers) using specific alarm calls, a skill often associated with large-brained animals such as primates. And it seems that they were doing the same with me, identifying my presence as a greater threat compared to other humans in the area. Instead of being distracted, introduced noise appeared to further increase the prairie dog’s perception of risk in the environment, in a phenomenon known as the “risk disturbance hypothesis”.  But at what cost? Taking flight burns valuable energy and interrupts foraging, which is crucial for any animal, but particularly for small-bodied species with high energetic demands such as the prairie dog. So the cost of reacting to perceived danger must be balanced against the risk of staying put. Being too reactive could, over time, affect the fitness of an individual prairie dog, and potentially impact upon their survival and reproduction. Clearly, this higher level of awareness comes at a price. And what if the cognitive challenges of identifying a threat were significantly increased? Predators are rarely as obvious as a human walking through the open prairie. At the end of the day, every species has a finite attention span and, depending upon the source of disturbance and the task at hand, can get distracted. In an increasingly noisy world, this will no doubt have implications for other animals as well as humans."

Share this...FacebookTwitterTrillions are being spent on the completely wrong scenario, an independent veteran meteorologist implies. Instead of warming, we need to worry about the coming 125-year cool period, which has already begun.
A former National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologist has spoken out in a just released 49-minute video that looks at climate change and what lies ahead.
The recent cold winters and expanding polar ice caps are ominous signs of a global cooling that has already begun, maintains David Dilley, now President and Founder of Global Weather Oscillations, Inc. Claims of warming have not been properly founded.

Dilley has forty-two years of professional experience in the meteorology and climatology and many publications. He was with NOAA for twenty years. Not only is the government wrong with its claims of a coming warming, Dilley accuses the federal government of fiddling with global temperature data with the aim of producing a false picture of what is going on.
In his must-see video presentation dubbed “Is Climate Change Dangerous?“, he examines the many drivers and factors behind climate change and why we need to focus on the real problem of a coming cooling.

Here are the points he makes in the video:
1. The 18+ years temperature pause is real. (4.09)
2. Natural cycles are behind the current pause.
3. Ice cores show CO2 lags temperature. (5.00)
4. 7000 years ago there was 50% less Arctic ice. (8.20)

11. Gravitational forces can bulge Earth’s core by 1.4 km (15.35)
12. Gravitational forces impact global temperature (17.20)
13. Warming and cooling both begin at the poles (17.48)
14. Arctic warming/melt was caused by warm ocean pulses (19.50)
15. “Now starting to see a dramatic cooling in the Arctic“. (22.50)
16. “Arctic is cooling rapidly now. Rapidly!” (24.06)
17. Both poles are cooling rapidly now. (25.05(
18. Poles don’t show signs of warming. (26.30)
19. Western drought and Eastern cold due to 26-year cycle. (27.55)
20. Polar vortices due to Arctic/global cooling. (29.25)
21. Lunar cycles correlated with warming/cooling cycles. (31.30)
22. Rapid global cooling by 2019. (32.00)
23. “Temperature fiddling” are “more political than anything”. (32.56)
24. “Could be the biggest scientific scandal ever”. (33.20)
25. IPCC using “estimated temperatures”. (34.00)
26. How the government manipulated, rewrote data. (36.00)

34. Global cooling is the real danger. (43.20)
35. Volcanoes and cooling often correlated. (44.00)
36. Crop failures from cooling “very likely”. (45.45)
37. “Extremely cold” from 2025 to 2050. (46.36)

"This morning I opened my inbox to find reams of emails – mid-season sale, 50% off, exclusive offer – enticing me to grab the best deal while it lasts. When we’re barraged by messages from the fashion industry to buy more, it’s hard to resist – and I have easily succumbed to these temptations in the past.  We are now producing and consuming fashion at a rate like never before. Since 2000, Europeans have purchased more pieces of clothing but spent less money in doing so: clothing prices in the EU have dropped by over 30%, relative to inflation. Meanwhile, the average person buys 60% more clothing and keeps it for about half as long as they did 15 years ago. Yet we’re facing a climate crisis and rapidly exceeding the planet’s resources. With our global population predicted to grow to 9 billion, and an unprecedented culture of overproduction and mass consumption, we are pushing our planet to its limits. By 2030 the global apparel and footwear industry will grow by an estimated 80%, according to industry research. If business continues as usual, humanity may require two planets’ worth of resources by 2050. Mass sales like Black Friday, Singles Day and Cyber Monday are only fanning the flames. This Friday, people across the globe will go crazy shopping for the cheapest offer available, some even physically fighting each other to grab products they could probably live without. In 2018, Black Friday generated $6.2bn in online sales in the US alone – a growth of 23.6% from the previous year. Earlier this month, China’s annual Singles Day generated a record $38bn in sales, up 25% since last year. Yes, this growth drives the economy. But what strain are we putting on our planet and people to meet this rising demand? Who’s paying for the externalities when prices are pushed to below the cost of making the products? Our planet and people are footing the bill. We’re invoicing our rivers, oceans, forests, labor force and coming generations. We used to think we could shop our way out of an economic crisis – but today, to sustain humanity, we’ll need to reduce our consumption and do business in an entirely different and sustainable way. This will entail consuming less and reusing more. But we will also have to reconsider how we think of prices. Our race to the bottom to supply low-cost products puts even more pressure on our resources and labor rights. In the pursuit of short-term sales, many fashion companies (and their customers) still ignore the severe environmental and social impact of production. The global apparel and footwear industry accounts for an estimated 6% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, 17-20% of all industrial water pollution and up to 20% of pesticide use. The sourcing of natural materials also damages fragile ecosystems and threatens biodiversity. Not only does fashion have harmful consequences in the manufacturing stage, but overconsumption is also generating an unparalleled amount of waste. While the demand for clothing is projected to increase at 2% a year, the number of times clothes are actually worn has dropped by a third compared to the early 2000s, according to our research. As new clothing comes into our lives, we also discard it at a shocking rate. Fashion is primarily produced in a linear system of “take, make, dispose”, and 73% of the world’s clothing eventually ends in landfills. In the past 10 years we have seen some promising progress in addressing the consequences of growth. Many fashion players of all sizes have committed to targets on “circularity”. François-Henri Pinault, CEO of the luxury group Kering, has recently succeeded in rallying over 35% of the market behind bold ambitions to tackle CO2 emissions, plastics in the oceans and biodiversity loss. Recycling and take-back systems are increasingly being adopted to reduce waste and reintegrate materials back into the supply chain to create new products. These are all important and valuable steps in the sustainability agenda. Nevertheless, additional progress requires even bolder, more urgent approaches. We need to redesign the traditional way of doing business and disrupt the entire system. That means forecasting better, producing smarter and producing less. It means we must develop new business models for reusing, reselling, recycling and working collectively to avoid overproduction and thus prevent excess stock and dependency on sales. I believe there’s a compelling business case for those who invest in long-term social and environmental sustainability, not just short-term profit. To do this, brands will need to reassess their business priorities and the impact they want to make. Leaders must address the root of the problem. Of course, the fashion industry cannot tackle this alone: dramatic change will require collaboration across the entire value chain, including organizations, policymakers, manufacturers and investors. As a first step – starting today – I encourage you to think before jumping on the Black Friday train in the endless hunt for a bargain. Instead, ask yourself: do I really need this? Eva Kruse is the CEO of Global Fashion Agenda, a non-profit organisation working to mobilise and guide the fashion industry to take bold and urgent action on sustainability. The Copenhagen Fashion Summit 2020 in May 2020 will convene leaders from across the industry to discuss the issue and potential solutions"
"Daimler has announced plans to cut at least 10,000 jobs worldwide in the latest sign of stress in the German automotive industry as it invests billions in electric cars. Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz and also makes lorries, vans and buses, said on Friday it planned to cut thousands of jobs by the end of 2022, but later made it clear the toll would be higher.  “The total number worldwide will be in the five-digits,” the personnel chief, Wilfried Porth, told journalists. The company will cut one in 10 of its managers worldwide. Mercedes-Benz, the maker of premium and luxury cars, outlined plans to save €1bn in staff costs this month, and union bosses suggested 1,100 jobs could go. Daimler’s move is the latest sign of the massive disruption facing the German car industry as it makes the historic move away from producing cars with internal combustion engines towards battery electric vehicles. At the same time, profitable diesel sales have slumped after emissions cheating scandals, and the runaway growth of sales in China has stopped. Battery electric cars are crucial to meet EU regulations coming into force in January that promise to impose fines potentially running into billions of euros on carmakers which do not reduce average carbon dioxide emissions below 95g per kilometre. Volkswagen’s Audi on Tuesday said it would cut up to 9,500 jobs at its German factories by 2025 to save €6bn. In March, the Volkswagen brand said it planned to make 7,000 job cuts, to save €5.9bn and allow it to hire more staff to work on digital technology. BMW reportedly plans to cut as many as 6,000 jobs in Germany by 2022. Daimler, which made profits of €7.6bn last year, said it had agreed to use “natural fluctuation” to cut job numbers across the group, as well as offering “part-time retirement” and a severance programme in Germany to cut the number of administration workers. Assembly line workers – who are subject to a jobs guarantee up until 2029 – are not included in the figures. In a statement, Daimler said: “The automotive industry is in the middle of the biggest transformation in its history. The development towards CO2-neutral mobility requires large investments.” The carmaker, which employs about 300,000 globally, has been increasing its spending on research and development in recent years but has yet to launch a mainstream electric vehicle. Its Mercedes-Benz EQC electric SUV is due to go on sale 2020."

We see many articles and posts about the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) as an excuse for carbon taxes, but nothing about the Social Benefits of Carbon (SBC). The very reason civilization is consuming fossil fuels and producing carbon dioxide is ignored. Carbon-based fuels drive civilization and have done so since man’s taming of fire. They heat and light our homes and places of business, transport us and our goods, and fuel industry. All that energy production has value. Ignoring this value is as insane as if you only entered checks in your checkbook and ignored deposits.
There is great argument about the value of the SCC. The amounts are estimates based on the costs of production and future pollution and impacts primarily, and range from a few dollars per ton of CO2 to a few hundred dollars, depending on the computation method. Here are the U. S. government’s most recent figures:

Table 1 from whitehouse.gov here.
But all these computations ignore the benefits attached to consuming carbon fuels. At first glance, it may seem difficult to put a value on benefits due to all the myriad ways that fossil fuels are used. Producing electricity is one use, and this was addressed in Boosting Per Capita Prosperity And Energy Consumption Is The Only Way To Care For Our Planet posted here in June 2013. But a more fundamental way to measure the prosperity that fossil fuels provide is to simply compare the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the per capita CO2 emissions. The plot below uses data from the World Bank found here and here. The data from 2011 was used because that year had the most complete data.

Figure 1 is a plot of emissions versus GDP for 189 countries for which the World Bank has data for 2011. Both axis are logarithmic scales. For a version of this graph with country labels and population, go to this link at GapMinder.
The outliers in Figure 1 are small countries with unusual circumstances, such as Luxembourg and Qatar (upper right). The United States is the dark blue dot at the upper right. The European countries are clustered to the left of the US. It is clear that a high GDP requires high emissions but it doesn’t answer the question as to the value of a tonne of CO2. The next plot answers that question by dividing the per capita GDP by the emissions per capita for each country and plotting that against per capita emissions.

Figure 2. The vertical scale is the per capita GDP per metric tonne of CO2 emitted, this is the  Social Benefit of Carbon in each country. The horizontal scale is the CO2 emissions per capita. The large blue triangle on the right is the U. S. Both vertical and horizontal scales are logarithmic.
In figure 2, the first 19 countries on the left are in Africa, with very small emissions per capita but high GDP relative to those emissions. The European countries on the right have high emissions but most also have high GDP relative to those emissions. The three lowest GDP dots with high emissions are “‘stan” countries in central Asia. The social benefit of carbon for the 19 African countries is quite high because they use very little carbon now and would benefit greatly from using more. The U. S. SBC is $2,924.84. The country-average SBC of all the points in figure 2 is $3,774.75. The Social Benefit of Carbon is ten to a hundred times the estimated Social Cost of Carbon in Table 1.

"And another one bites the dust. The year 2014 was the warmest ever recorded by humans. Then 2015 was warmer still. January 2016 broke the record for the largest monthly temperature anomaly. Then came last month.  February didn’t break climate change records – it obliterated them. Regions of the Arctic were were more than 16℃ warmer than normal – whatever constitutes normal now. But what is really making people stand up and notice is that the surface of the Earth north of the equator was 2℃ warmer than pre-industrial temperatures. This was meant to be a line that must not be crossed. Two degrees was broadly interpreted as the temperature that could produce further, potentially runaway warming. You can think of it as a speed limit on our climate impact. But it’s not a target speed. If you are driving a car carrying a heavy load down a steep hill you’re often advised to change down from top gear and keep your speed low, as if you go too fast your brakes will fail and you will be unable to stop. Less braking means more speed which means less braking – a dangerous runaway feedback loop. Hopefully the hill flattens out and you have enough straight road ahead to recover. If you don’t then you will be stopping much more abruptly.  We are currently swamping the Earth’s ability to absorb greenhouse gases. 2015 saw the largest annual increase in carbon dioxide since records began – far higher than the Earth has experienced for hundreds of thousands of years.  More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means higher temperatures. There is already one positive feedback loop in operation; the extra warming from our emissions is increasing the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, which further increases temperatures. Fortunately, this is not a very strong feedback loop.  Unfortunately, there seem to be other, much more powerful ones lurking in the event of further warming. Tipping points such as the thaw of permafrost and release of the very powerful greenhouse gas methane in large quantities would drive world temperatures well beyond the 2℃ threshold.  Even if we came to our collective senses and rapidly reduced carbon emissions at that point, we would still have to revert to drastic geoengineering to rein in further warming. There is no guarantee that such climate brakes will work. If they fail, our civilisation would be on a collision course with a much hotter planet.  The safe–unsafe threshold of 2℃ recognises the significant amount of uncertainty there is over where dangerous warming really begins. It could be at more than 2℃. Hopefully it is. But it’s not impossible that it is less. We need to bear in mind that it was only the northern hemisphere that crossed the 2℃ line. Also, we need to factor in the monster El Niño that is having an effect on temperatures across the globe. In 2014, I predicted that 2015 would break record temperatures. This is not due to any psychic powers on my part, but the then very clear El Niño signal that was emerging.  So while temperature records may continue to be set for the rest of 2016, by the end of this year the situation should have cooled somewhat. Right? At times, it feels as if such statements are offered up as prayers in the hope that we are not in fact witnessing the beginning of abrupt and sustained climate change. But what’s even scarier is the political, economic and social reaction to these landmarks in climate change.  Have you heard any political speeches referring to these recent climate change records? Not one of the major Republican presidential candidates even “believes” in human-produced climate change, let alone that it is something to worry about.  How was the stock market this morning? It appears febrile enough to lurch from euphoric boom to catastrophic bust on the basis of bland statements from central bankers but proves remarkably deaf to evidence that the entire industrial and financial system is headed for disaster. Know what’s trending on Twitter as I write? A photoshopped giant dog, the latest Game of Thrones trailer and Kim Kardashian’s naked body. Actually, it’s mainly Kim Kardashian’s naked body and people’s responses to it. Followed by people’s responses to the responses.  It would be churlish of me to deny people the pleasure of looking at pictures of a photograph of a cuddly dog adjusted in order to make it appear both cute and monstrous. But we appear disinterested, either through denial or desensitisation, to the environmental changes happening right in front of our eyes. There are sure to be more climate records broken this year. But we treat them as we treat new fashions, phones or films. More novelty, newer features, more drama. We seem unable to understand that we are driving such changes. Record breaking changes that will ultimately break our civilisation, and so scatter all that we obsess and care about."
"I was five years old in 1997 when my mum took me with her to the polling station and let me scratch a wobbly X on the ballot paper. My main impression of the general election was it meant that I didn’t have to go to school that day, and that voting Labour had something to do with Mum buying the biggest watermelon I’d ever seen from the Turkish shop on the way home. More opaque was why she cried the next morning, or phoned her sister just to repeat “This is amazing … it’s just amazing” over and over. I think I understand her a bit better now. For a struggling single parent with two young kids, the end of 18 years of continuous Tory rule felt like being let out of a dark room.  Today, we’ve come through nine more such years. We’ve seen Grenfell; the Windrush scandal; £5bn of cuts to disability benefits; 4 million children at risk of malnutrition owing to poverty; a parliament of landlords voting against a measure that would ensure all homes were fit for human habitation; rough sleepers in Westminster evicted after a complaint by the Commons chaplain about their “ongoing stench”. The home secretary, Priti Patel, standing in a food bank, shifting the blame for growing poverty on to the local councils whose budget her government had cut. The last decade has seen our politicians turn into vandals, and a hatchet taken to the social contract. What we have witnessed is nothing less than, in the Italian theorist Franco Berardi’s words, “the slow cancellation of the future”. Austerity hasn’t just decimated our public services. It has corroded the political imagination. The suggestion that the government might exist to improve people’s lives rather than oversee the managed decline of our society is greeted as somehow preposterous. We’re told the things that we had in the past would be unreasonable to have in the future. Politicians who got their university education for free tell the young that tuition fees are simply a fact of life. The return to corporation tax to about 2010 levels is regarded as akin to Maoism. And Boris Johnson, who has been otherwise careful to avoid the miserable determinism of Theresa May’s 2017 campaign, fell back on the familiar bleat that there’s no way to “magic up” money for those who have borne the brunt of Conservative economic policy. Nowhere is our country’s atrophied capacity to imagine better more apparent than in the political class’s response to the climate emergency. Sure, Extinction Rebellion occasionally lurch into self-parody, but no amount of hippy-dippy nonsense could be more shameful than Adam Boulton’s tirade on Sky News this year in which he accused climate activists of being “the incompetent middle-class” and “self-indulgent”. That a broadcaster rumoured to be paid £400,000 a year can get away with calling others moneyed and out of touch has permanently damaged the part of my brain responsible for processing irony. There’s something fairly insane about a media culture that praises Michael Gove as an environmentalist hero for using a reusable cup while simultaneously delegitimising protest movements associated with climate justice. Aided and abetted by a supine media, the government has been allowed to miss a six-month deadline set by parliament to address the climate emergency. We are already on course to miss the dreadfully unambitious target set by May to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. And despite large swathes of South Yorkshire still being under floodwater, Brexit continues to be trotted out by broadcasters as the defining issue of this election.  There are problems with the Labour party. They have not committed to preserving freedom of movement in all circumstances; they have stuck with a prohibitionist approach to drugs; they have not stamped out antisemitism as ruthlessly as they ought to. But I will not let perfect be the enemy of hope. At its heart, the Jeremy Corbyn project represents the return of the future. In 1963, Harold Wilson promised that a “new Britain” would be forged in “the white heat of technology”. Now Labour vows that a green industrial revolution will bring in hundreds of thousands of jobs in renewable energy, green construction and transport infrastructure. How could we possibly afford to do all this? How could we possibly afford not to? What could be more urgent than securing a sustainable future on the only planet we have to live on? Somehow money always turned up when we needed to bail out the banks or pay for no-deal posturing, keep May in power with a bung for the DUP, or clean up after Chris Grayling. It gets harder to believe that “there is no alternative” to economic misery when, quite clearly, there is when the Tories need it. What’s at stake in this election? The future, and the possibility of its return. • Ash Sarkar is a senior editor at Novara Media, and lectures in political theory at the Sandberg Instituut"
"Not only was December 2015 the UK’s wettest month on record, but it was also exceptionally stormy. Bad news for many, but great news for the country’s wind power and hydro generators.  In fact, storms Desmond, Eva and Frank meant that throughout December, more than 19% of Great Britain’s (not the UK’s – as Northern Ireland is not included in the underlying data) electrical energy came from wind, solar and hydro combined. That’s the highest ever figure for a calendar month. It was an exceptional end to an unusual year that saw several new records set within Britain’s power sector as the transition from dirty to clean energy continued. Here are a few of the most notable outcomes. Wind, solar and hydro – the weather-dependent renewables – together generated 14.6% of Great Britain’s electrical energy in 2015, the highest ever annual amount. Wind stormed (literally) past the 2014 record to break through the 10% milestone. Solar more than doubled to 2.5%. The weather-dependent renewables of wind, solar and hydro peaked at 22% of Britain’s electrical energy generation over the week of Christmas (the grey line in week 52 on the chart above) – another record. June saw the highest ever daily percentage of solar generation, peaking on Sunday June 7 at 8.9% – another new record.  The previous day, June 6, was both sunny and windy, which meant at 2pm solar, wind and hydro were generating more than 40% of British electricity. Coal may also have dropped to a record low at the same point. Natural gas generated more than a quarter of Britain’s electricity throughout 2015. It was enough to return gas to top spot, but still far below its 46% peak six years ago. Coal continued its decline. As recently as 1990, Britain still relied on coal to generate more than 70% of its electricity. But things have changed a great deal since then as natural gas and more recently renewables have provided more options. British energy is now more diversified than ever. In fact, averaged over 2015, no individual fuel source provided more than 30% of the electricity generated – the first time this has ever happened.  More renewables and less coal means that when the UK’s Department of Energy and Climate Change release their greenhouse gas emissions statistics for the power sector this March, 2015 will be the lowest value recorded since 1990.  A rough estimate (using this data) puts the emissions somewhere between 105 and 110 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is at least a 45% reduction from the power sector since 1990 – the country is making significant progress towards decarbonisation. Where next? It’s very possible that 2016 will see coal generation drop below nuclear for the very first time since Britain’s (and the world’s) first nuclear plant came online 60 years ago. The underlying data of the differing fuel types and imports/exports is available from Elexon and National Grid websites for each half hourly period of the year. This analysis adds these values together to provide a total for each period. The percentages presented here are then calculated using this total, and it is likely that these can slightly differ from other analyses (including that of DECC) due to a different methodology or by using different estimates of embedded wind or solar generation."
"Can you break the law to stop climate change … and get away with it? That’s exactly what five climate change activists wanted to argue at a recent criminal trial in Seattle, Washington. In September 2014 the group tied themselves to a 25ft (8 metre) high “tripod” over a railway line in Washington State, US, to block a train carrying crude oil which, if used, would have contributed directly to carbon emissions and so climate change. The activists, now known as the “Delta 5”, relied on the so-called “necessity defence” to justify their actions and avoid criminal liability. A successful “necessity defence” needs to show that the crime was necessary in order to prevent an even greater criminal act or irreparable evil. There should be no reasonable legal alternative available under the circumstances. In court, the Delta 5 argued that their actions to prevent the oil from reaching its destination were necessary to stop the greater harm of climate change. As such, they said they shouldn’t be held criminally responsible. The activists hoped to set a new precedent in the United States which would have paved the way for climate activists in the future to more readily use necessity as a defence to criminal charges. In 2008, for example, a group of six Greenpeace activists were tried in the UK for property damage and trespass after shutting down a coal power station. They used the necessity defence and were acquitted by a jury.  The judge in Seattle, however, ruled that the defendants had failed to show that there was no reasonable legal alternative to their actions. Even though the judge was sympathetic to the activists cause, she was bound by case-law on the lack of evidence supporting a necessity defence and reluctantly instructed the jury to ignore all wider arguments about climate change. The five were found guilty of misdemeanour trespassing.  Legal recognition for “necessity” remains a long-term goal for climate activism, but the latest setback shows how difficult these arguments are to win in court. It’s not just climate change. Attempts to justify the use of marijuana for medical purposes have been met with mixed success, where successful necessity defences have been very much the exception rather than the rule. Necessity has been most successful in cases involving potential crimes by doctors around the issue of consent, but there are major limits. It’s usually not recognised as a defence against murder charges, for example, a view that dates back to the 1880s when two shipwrecked sailors decided to kill and eat their subordinate, a cabin boy, for survival when lost at sea. While necessity is difficult to assert in climate activism trials, the Delta 5 and Greenpeace cases raise a big question: should activists be allowed to take matters into their own hands to prevent global warming and climate change? Given underwhelming results in combating this at the international level to date, arguably they should. The Paris climate change agreement in December was celebrated as a major achievement in bringing all states together, developed and developing alike, to agree on a common plan to reduce global carbon emissions. However, on closer inspection, it doesn’t seem to be ambitious enough to work as expected. Warming will be limited to 2.7°C, at best, while the agreement isn’t yet legally-binding. Climate change is still likely to have severe effects. If states are unwilling or unable to sufficiently reduce their carbon emissions in time to make a real difference, shouldn’t people around the world be encouraged to take robust action without fear of being thrown in jail for their efforts to do good? Since the 1950s legal theorists have argued about the consequences for people who feel morally compelled to break the law. The so-called “Hart-Fuller” debate, which continues to divide legal scholars to this day, examined among other things the nature of laws in Nazi Germany – for example, was legislation which authorised the transportation of Jews to concentration camps valid law at the time? The prominent legal philosopher HLA Hart argued yes: he believed laws continue to have legal force, despite a questionable moral basis. Lon Fuller, his rival, said that laws have an inner morality, without which there is nothing to be enforced or obeyed as “law”.  Fuller’s position may provide moral guidance to climate activists who perceive as immoral the legal framework currently configured to see global temperatures far exceed the 2°C limit. They can use society’s understanding of what the law ought to be – one that protects the environment – to justify their decision to disobey. Hart would say that the law should not be disobeyed despite its questionable moral basis because to do so may open the door to anarchy and conflict. However the necessity defence falls squarely within the letter of the law, and therefore Hart’s theory, though it remains notoriously difficult to prove. Climate activists should bear in mind that they will need convincing proof of no reasonable legal alternative to their actions in order to increase their chances of success when raising necessity as a defence in future criminal trials. The best way for climate activists to do this would be to leverage conventional legal and political routes as much as possible to achieve their goals. Once all of these options have been exhausted, then there may be no further reasonable legal alternatives left and as such, acts of civil disobedience which break the law may more easily be justified as being necessary. But as yet, strategies that draw upon Fuller’s theory of the inner morality of law, to justify disobeying the law regardless of reasonable legal alternatives, may not help activists keep a clean criminal record. It is quite clear that necessity isn’t a reliable defence against criminal charges at present. But more sympathetic judges and juries in the future may radically transform the odds of success. The judge in the Delta 5’s case was sympathetic, though it didn’t lead to their successfully defending their position. As the effects of climate change become more and more noticeable, perhaps there will be no reasonable legal alternative in the future but to follow in their footsteps. The law just might keep pace."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe data on this year’s meteorological summer (June-July-August) are coming in and they tell us trouble is brewing at the high latitudes. I reported here on this earlier.
The Irish warming famine
First, fresh data from Ireland show that the country had one of the coldest summers in living memory, despite near average sunshine. The Irish News here reports:
Armagh Observatory, which has been recording the weather in the city since 1795, found that June, July and August had an average temperature of just over 14 degrees – slightly colder than the bad summers of 2011 and 1993 and the coldest since 1986.”
So what’s going on? We see using NOAA data how northern Quebec, Greenland, the North Atlantic, Britain, Scandinavia and across a vast part of Northern Russia temperatures were markedly cooler than normal this past summer:

NCEP/NCAR reanalysis shows frigid summer conditions across the north. Hat-tip: Wobleibt. Source: www.esrl.noaa.gov
Cold Atlantic with coming La Nina bode ill
The rapidly cooling North Atlantic  and a large switch f the Arctic bodes very ill for the globe, especially in view of the fact that it will combine with the expected upcoming La Nina on the heels of the current El Nino, and therefore we may see global temperatures plummeting by up to half a degree in a about 2 years time.

Another ominous sign is Greenland has seen its massive ice sheet grow by 220 km³. This is enough to cover the entire country of Spain with half a meter of ice.
Warmists panicking?
Already forecasts of horror-winters are appearing for northern Europe, and they will come true should the mass of cold stick around. Caution with such forecasts are advised, of course.
The overall North Atlantic cooling development already appears to have some warmists in a state of panic, and so it’s no surprise we are now seeing highly dubious studies insisting that the warming is causing the cooling.
Canary in coal mine Arctic stops cooperating…
Thanks to the oceanic ENSO cycles this year globally as a whole the planet has been warmer than normal. However the equatorial regions of the globe are not really the locations that alarmists customarily showcase as the ones to watch, especially in view of the fact that weather balloons have failed to show any warming up in the lower troposphere, precisely where the theory claims this is where you’d expect it.
Both poles no longer cooperating
Over the better part of the last decade the warmists liked using the high latitude Arctic regions as the “canary in the coal mine”. They also used to showcase Antarctica as well, but the South Pole stopped cooperating with melting scenarios years ago, and now so has the Arctic stopped cooperating.
Scientists are now acknowledging that a return of Arctic sea ice is entirely possible. There’s real trouble brewing for the warmists.

"With Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage refusing to take part, Channel 4’s climate debate was a pretty straightforward affair, with the leaders of the Greens, Labour, Plaid Cymru, Scottish National party and Liberal Democrats competing to outdo each other on climate promises, rather than attacking anyone’s record. Berry: Only the Greens will put the climate and biodiversity crises at the very top of the government’s priorities, and other parties are only taking these issues seriously now because the Greens have won the argument. Corbyn: Unlike the Tories, Labour has a climate plan and it will create huge numbers of jobs in a “green industrial revolution” encompassing offshore wind farms, housing upgrades, nationalised railways and energy, and a lot of new trees. Price: The Plaid Cymru leader made a strong pitch that Wales has been neglected by Westminster governments handing out infrastructure investment, which is vital to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Sturgeon: Scotland is already a leader in onshore and offshore wind, and could go much further in renewable energy generation, as well as tree-planting and nature conservation. Swinson: The Liberal Democrats have traditionally been the strongest on green issues among the three main parties but have struggled to regain lost ground after taking part in the coalition, which failed to fulfil its promise to be “the greenest government ever”. Swinson’s commitments, for instance on achieving net zero only five years before the Tories, looked less impressive when compared with other parties. Berry: The Greens have had the climate at the top of their agenda for years while the others are just catching up, Berry pointed out: “Do you trust them to get this done without more Greens in parliament?” Corbyn: “This election is the last chance to tackle our climate emergency.” Corbyn did a good job of showing that he knows the issues, even if he didn’t have answers for all of them. Price: “After Scotland, Wales has the best resources [for renewable energy]. Wales was the cradle of the industrial revolution – and can be of the next one.” The country famous for coal can generate renewable energy and green jobs. Sturgeon: “COP26 will be in Glasgow – Scotland will be leading the way.” Next year, a international conference called COP26, where governments from every country will gather to determine the fate of the Paris climate agreement, will be hosted by the UK in Glasgow. Sturgeon made it clear she will make the most of that international stage, and the Tories may regret their decision to award host status to the city. Swinson: Pointed out that small contributions by individuals are not enough – we need systemic change, and only politicians can achieve that. “Making it easier and cheaper to make the right thing, so it becomes the obvious decision to make.” Berry: This debate was one for the Greens to shine, so in response to any commitment made by other parties – on how soon to reach net-zero carbon, on how much money to invest, on how to protect nature – Berry’s trump card was that the Greens would go further and faster. Corbyn: Labour put the “green industrial revolution” at the top of its manifesto, and Corbyn has a personal image for green living, from his allotment to his self-professed “miserable-ness” in refusing to turn on the heating. Corbyn would also seek international cooperation on the global problem of the climate. Price: Stressed Wales’s potential contribution and future growth from renewable energy. Sturgeon: Scotland has a strong story on renewable energy. Just don’t mention North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: Frequent flyer levy on anyone taking more than three international return flights a year. Berry: Failed to explain why scrapping HS2 was a good idea, when calling for less flying. Corbyn: Defending nationalisation of the electricity grid, which Price suggested would divert investment from renewables, by claiming it would be easier to sell biogas back into the grid. Price: A rather feeble brag of claiming green credentials for changing his reusable nappies for his newborn son. Sturgeon: Refusing to directly address the question of North Sea oil and gas, preferring vague references to a “just transition” to low-carbon jobs. Swinson: Floundering while trying to explain why the Lib Dems’ target of net zero by 2045 was so much better than the Tories’ 2050 target. Berry: Is it realistic to borrow £1tn over the next decade? Corbyn: Does the party back Heathrow expansion, which half of Labour MPs voted for, and nuclear power? Price: Can Wales make the transition from a former coal-based economy to low-carbon industry? Sturgeon: North Sea oil and gas. Swinson: The Lib Dem record in the coalition. Berry: Berry showed a depth of familiarity with the issues that is her party’s key selling point. Corbyn: Believable on these issues, and with a strong manifesto on the green industrial revolution. Price: Hammered home the point that Wales’s potential has been overlooked and undermined by Westminster. Sturgeon: SNP are comfortable on renewables and the natural environment, less so on the North Sea. Swinson: Struggling to reclaim what used to be an easy win for the Lib Dems in being one of the greenest parties – now looking outflanked by Labour. Boris Johnson, represented by a melting ice block. The Tories’ decision not to engage on this vital issue shows they are just not interested in pitching to younger voters, who rate the environment as a leading concern. They have decided that the leave voters they are after won’t be basing their votes on this, and their climate plans don’t stand up to scrutiny."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSpiegel science journalist Axel Bojanowski here writes a harsh but well-deserved analysis of the heated debate now raging in climate science.
One thing that we can gather from his analysis is that consensus is totally absent, and that it is very difficult to trust any report on climate science nowadays. He writes in the sub-headline:
Reports on climate science are hardly trustworthy, analyses show. The reason is biased journalists, hyping politicians and arrogant scientists.” 
Bojanowski writes that too often the huge uncertainty in the science rarely ever gets properly mentioned, criticizing for example the UN IPCC 2007 claim that hurricanes were in fact growing in intensity. Today of course know we know this is false as there hasn’t been a single major hurricane strike in the US since. (See EPA report)
Distorted communication
Spiegel’s Bojanowski describes a smoke-and-mirrors environment within climate science and its communication. He writes climate scientists today have a “communication problem“, stemming in large part from “uncertainties and knowledge gaps“. The Spiegel journalist feels “their results all too often remain buried“. Citing a recent SAGE article on climate science communication, Bojanowski tells his readers that the authors of reports often present “results coming from climate science in a troublesome way“.
Bojanowski, a geology major, also examines the main purveyors of public climate science knowledge (from a German perspective), arranging them from the extreme downplayers of the issue, all the way to the extreme alarmists: European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE), WattsUpWithThat by Anthony Watts, Klimazwiebel by Hans von Storch, Real Climate, The Guardian, and German ultra-alarmist site Klimaretter.
Opinions aside, if anything can be said of his ranking it is that the alarmists in fact do not represent the often claimed overwhelming majority and that in fact a broad spectrum of different positions on the science truly exists – just as one should if the science is to progress and not morph into some sort of unchallengeable dogma.
Bojanowski accuses both sides of distorting the results of science. For example he claims that especially in the USA so-called skeptics (see chart) distort science results in order to label the warnings from climate science as being “exaggerated” .

Uncertainty needs to be highlighted
Spiegel also looks at the efforts being made to improve the communication of climate science, but hints that these efforts are probably making the situation worse. He looks for example at the attempts by Stephan Lewandosky, which were aimed at schooling scientists on reporting their results to produce more pronounced reactions among readers. For example Lewandosky recommends the use of words like “risk” instead of “uncertainty”.  Bojanowski cites a study by Gregory Hollin and Warren Pearce, who conclude that scientists must do a better job at emphasizing the large uncertainties that plague the science.
“Arrogance”, and “imaginary consensus”
The Spiegel journalist also sharply criticizes the IPCC’s introduction of the Summary Report in Stockholm in 2013. “Critical questions by journalists back then were unjustly rebuffed and inadequately answered.”  He then characterizes the IPCC’s  Michel Jarraud handling of an inconvenient question on the global temperature pause by a British reporter as “arrogant”.
Bojanowski writes that journalists seem to cling to the false notion of consensus: “In many reports the journalists seem to cite imaginary consensus.” He brings up a survey of 1868 climate scientists that found no consensus at all among them.
Bojanowski also thinks that US secretary of State John Kerry appears to confuse climate science hypotheses with real prognoses, and adds that although the politicians may have good intentions, they too are doing as poor job communicating the science.
Journal of Science’s McNutt blasted
Bojanowski also shines a harsh light on the chief editor at Science, Marcia McNutt, who is demanding an immediate end to the discussion and that the world take action. Bojanowski responds by bringing up former Obama science advisor Steven Koonin, who rebuked McNutt’s position in an essay in the Wall Street Journal.
Probably the main underlying message of Bojanowski piece at Spiegel is that the science is indeed still very fraught with large uncertainty, and that this uncertainty all too often gets wrongly dismissed. Also it is far too early to make specific policy decisions based on the very little that we do know about climate science. Also one gathers that arrogant scientists who fancy themselves as the bearers of the truth should not be the only ones politicians listen too.

"In 2008 a Walmart worker was trampled to death by crowds at a Black Friday shop opening in New York. The event was one of a handful of incidents that became emblematic of that distinctly American occasion. Black Friday, which takes place today, still registers as the busiest shopping day of the year in the US.  But in recent years, shopping aisles in the UK have started to tremble too. Black Friday, once only seen by Britons when watching US television shows, is a regular part of the calendar. It was most noticeably introduced, in 2013, by Asda, itself owned by Walmart, alongside mainstream retailers such as Argos, John Lewis and Amazon. Slowly these strange annual scenes of feverish consumption made news across the UK: the police were called to 15 different Tesco outlets in 2014. Inevitably, Black Friday has now established itself as one the biggest retailing days in Britain, too – but this year it’s a far more muted affair, with sales spread over an extended period. Amazon, for example, now heralds Black Friday with a whole week of discounts – a trend matched by many competitors. While some retailers continue to tantalise shoppers by announcing their Black Friday opening hours, the day itself hasn’t the spectacular veneer of its US cousin. In Britain there is a long tradition of moralising about mindless materialism. As far back as the Elizabethan era, a moral panic emerged about an “orgy of spending”. Later, Marxist philosophers such as Theodor W Adorno treated the consumerism of the postwar era as a foolish “fetish”. Books such as The Hidden Persuaders by Vance Packard, published in 1957, and No Logo by Naomi Klein in 1999, became huge sellers in their eras, both describing a world that had become colonised by marketing and branding. By the 1990s and 2000s, exuberant consumer culture was confronted by an equally exuberant anti-consumerism. Popular movements such as Adbusters and Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping, and movie hits such as Fight Club and American Psycho denounced a spiritually bankrupt culture. These concerns were accompanied by increasing environmental activism. By now, confronted by the stark realism of the climate emergency messages delivered by Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion, the penny is starting to drop as we learn to correlate our lifestyles with the fate of the planet. Today, in austerity Britain (and, yes, for all the talk of spending promises, austerity is still here), the idea of excessive consumerism seems to have lost much of its resonance. Memories of consumerism and easy credit seem to have become tainted by the recession. Academics have observed how Britons felt ashamed of their pre-crash consumerism and (wrongly) felt personally accountable for the austerity that followed, identifying particular consumer objects – such as expensive tracksuits and conservatories – as symptomatic of a flaw in the national character. For many consumers, shopping has become mixed with guilt and a sense of responsibility as it increasingly depends on credit card debt and the labour of poorly paid and precarious workers – and it has a heavy environmental toll. Buying something today is also an experience drained of fun: it often entails making sure you are in when the package arrives, unpacking it and realising that it isn’t what you wanted. In this context, Black Friday arrives in all its ambivalence. We may still be served the familiar spectacles of excited consumers carrying giant plasma TVs out of shops, while an army of delivery workers ring doorbells throughout the nation. But there is no shine and veneer, and the rampant consumerism of the 1990s, with its attendant resistance, seems very far away. The time is right for a more resonant and joyful anti-consumerism. The recognition that we need to downsize our lifestyles for environmental reasons now corresponds not with the false political economy of austerity, but the very real awareness of the damage that consumer capitalism wreaks on the world. The challenge, then, is to make anti-consumerism joyful by emphasising the satisfaction and necessity of becoming more sustainable and refusing to fuel a system grounded in the exploitation of people and the environment. Today, the greatest pleasures might be found in not shopping at all. • Alan Bradshaw is a professor of marketing at Royal Holloway, University of London and is proudly on strike.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt the online Spiegel magazine here science journalist and geology major Axel Bojanowski features his “Photo of the Week”, which this week shows a dust storm blowing across the East Atlantic off the African Sahara.

The above photo is provided by NASA Earth Observatory, taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite. It shows dust sweeping off the coast of Western Sahara and Morocco on August 7, 2015.
NASA writes that this is just one of several outbreaks of Saharan dust that have occurred over the Atlantic this summer. The US space agency adds this is even a positive effect on the hurricane season, in combination with another factor (my emphasis):
While several factors influence hurricane formation, some research suggests that plumes of dry Saharan dust may help suppress storms over the Atlantic Ocean. In a recent update to its hurricane outlook for the Atlantic Basin, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center said a below-normal season appeared even more likely than it did in May. A strengthening El Niño, an atmospheric environment conducive to strong wind shear, and below average sea-surface temperatures in the Atlantic were cited as the primary factors limiting hurricane development. Dust outbreaks were not included as a factor because of their unpredictability, according to reporting by The Palm Beach Post.
Not only is the Saharan dust playing a role on dampening the Atlantic hurricane season, it is also transporting rich nutrients that are fertilizing the ocean, the Canary Islands and even the Caribbean and South American jungle, Spiegel writes.

"A novel way of monitoring air pollution in London has taken flight. The Pigeon Air Patrol has set loose a legion of winged “scientists”, complete with small backpacks containing sensors that measure levels of nitrogen dioxide, and several other pollutants. This is just the latest in a range of high-profile citizen science projects that use small, low-cost air quality sensors (not all of which are strapped to pigeons). If the media hype is to be believed, start-up companies from London to San Francisco are now using these sensors to provide detailed information on air pollution levels where people actually live and work.  The ambition is to create a democratisation in information, better informing the public and enabling lifestyle decisions that limit their exposure – and creating data that pressures local authorities to clean up the air its residents breathe. This is big news when you consider that in the UK alone air quality is estimated to be responsible for over 30,000 premature deaths a year.  The UK government currently invests significant money into measuring real-time air pollution at around 150 air quality monitoring sites, where highly trained personnel operate expensive, high-tech instruments. The costs run to many millions of pounds a year – but why bother when a flock of pigeons could provide a much higher density of measurements for a fraction of the price?  Atmospheric scientists love their gadgets and invest significant time and money in developing and running equipment to measure the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Yet very few have embraced this apparent sensor revolution – and even fewer have published data on them in scientific literature.  Despite the user-friendly apps, clever websites and considerable media publicity with crowd-sourced funding, virtually none of this new monitoring tech – pigeon-borne or otherwise – has supporting evidence that it can provide accurate measurements in the real atmosphere. The assumption being that it must be – and very few people have any way of checking for themselves. We have spent the past 12 months at the Wolfson Atmospheric Chemistry Laboratories looking into just how well these low-cost air monitoring sensors perform, with an interesting result: when relying on data from these sensors you must be very cautious indeed. We exposed different sensors to a wide range of chemicals and conditions that they would encounter in the real world, and compared the data with more established technologies. The majority of sensors tested did indeed respond to the chemicals they are designed to measure and, after calibration, could measure realistic ambient concentrations in short, controlled laboratory experiments. But we also found that many of the sensors also responded to a whole range of other pollutants and that responses from these chemicals could swamp the device and give artificial readings.  We also saw large sensor-to-sensor variability: 20 identical commercial air quality sensor units running side by side for two weeks reported pollution numbers that differed by up to a factor of ten. Overall, our results found that the quality of the data fed back by some low-cost sensors can be misleading – often reporting pollution to be worse than it actually was – and, in some cases, completely wrong. As an atmospheric chemist, whose career has been spent building and testing instruments to measure chemicals in the atmosphere, the results from these experiments were no great surprise. Our atmosphere is an incredibly complex mixture and the concentrations of pollutants are actually very low. For example, the current EU air quality guideline for nitrogen dioxide is about 20 molecules in every billion.  Atmospheric measurement technology is constantly improving and miniaturising, but over the decades improvements have been gradual and incremental. In my opinion, this new approach in air pollution sensors is simply trying to leap too big a gap in one go. Are these just the complaints of an elitist scientist, moaning about the public getting in on our research area? Perhaps these sensors are just a bit of fun? It all depends of course on how the data are used. If the aim is to simply engage public interest in the issues, then perhaps the quality of data doesn’t matter. But what if an asthma sufferer makes medication decisions based on the read-outs of their local sensor?  If the road outside your house was closed because of a high pollution warning from a sensor, you would want this to be based on the most accurate data available. In many developing countries low-cost sensors are being installed  to manage often-chronic air pollution problems in place of more expensive traditional monitors. Should policy and investment in these places be based on technologies without acknowledging their weaknesses as well as their strengths? Even the UN Environment Programme has promoted a low-cost pollution sensor, but has never published real-world data that demonstrates the sensors work in this application. If we can cut through the hype, there really is fantastic potential for sensor systems in understanding human exposure, managing emissions and supporting effective policy. Undoubtedly these sensors work to some degree but, like all measurement science, the hard yards need to be done in the lab first in order to understand how this technology performs in the complex mixture that is our atmosphere. Less emphasis on websites and apps and rather more on characterisation and calibration will ultimately help solve some of these problems."
"The end of Beirut’s eight-month garbage crisis may be in sight, now that trucks have begun removing the piles of rubbish accumulating in the streets to temporary landfill sites. The problems began when the city’s main landfill site was closed last July, after local residents protested that it was at capacity. No alternative sites were provided for waste disposal, so garbage began to pile up on the city’s peripheries, and eventually in the city itself.  When crises like this occur in other countries, Europeans tend to congratulate themselves on their efficient waste management systems. But the recent strike by garbage collectors in the Spanish city of Málaga – which resulted in enormous rubbish heaps choking the streets – shows how not all EU members manage their waste well.  It’s not a new situation in Europe either: the Campania region in southern Italy has suffered serious problems with municipal waste management since the mid-1990s. The area between Naples and Caserta has even been nicknamed the “land of fires”, as a consequence of the frequent blazes burning up huge mounds of illegal and hazardous wastes.  At one point in 2007, the US Embassy in Rome warned Americans against travelling to Naples and its surrounds, citing health risks. The city’s tourist trade still suffers from its reputation for dirty streets. So why do some European countries manage their waste well, while others lurch from catastrophe to catastrophe? After all, the EU has issued directives for all its member states regarding waste disposal, so you’d expect some consistency.  For one thing, the amount of municipal waste generated differs substantially between EU countries, ranging from 747kg per capita in Denmark, to 272kg per capita in Romania in 2013. These variations reflect differences in economic wealth and consumption patterns, but also depend on how municipal waste is collected and managed.  Landfill has generally been the main method of municipal waste treatment and disposal in the EU. But a defining moment occurred in 1975, when EU laws introduced the so-called “waste hierarchy”.  The waste hierarchy indicates an order of preference for different measures to reduce and manage waste. The hierarchy prioritises waste prevention: this could include using environmentally-friendly product designs, implementing local waste prevention plans and financial disincentives such as landfill tax. When waste is created, the hierarchy then gives priority to direct re-use, then to recycling and recovery methods – such as energy recovery from waste to produce heat or electricity – and last of all, to disposal.  It was optional for member states to adopt the waste hierarchy; but there was an expectation that it would be included within national waste management laws. It was hoped that the hierarchy would protect the environment, conserve resources and minimise the amount of waste generated.  For a couple of decades, very few countries took any notice of the hierarchy. High levels of landfilling continued across the EU throughout the 1990s. It wasn’t until 1999 that addressing the issue became a political priority, which led to the EU’s landmark landfill directive.  Specific targets were not set for the overall reduction of disposal via landfill, but for the amount of plant and food waste sent to landfill. Further directives emphasised the need for member states to adopt the waste hierarchy. The most significant was the EU Waste Framework Directive, introduced in 2008, which set an objective that 50% of all municipal solid waste was to be recycled or composted by 2020.  But even these blanket targets offer no guarantee of successful waste management across Europe. For one thing, many countries break European laws without any obvious consequences; for example Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia missed the 2010 and 2013 targets for diverting biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.  What’s more, every country takes a different approach: a huge range of combinations of recycling, composting, incineration and landfilling are used across the EU. Northern and central European countries have made most progress in terms of moving away from landfill: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Netherlands landfill less than 3% of their municipal waste. Meanwhile, countries in the east and south have made little or no progress.  The reasons for this disparity are complicated, but factors include the availability of finance, political and social will, technical skills, suitable planning and legal frameworks, and a wide range of other social, demographic, cultural and administrative factors. The notion that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to EU citizens also means that member states are obliged to come up with waste management strategies to suit their people, rather than take a uniform approach.  Meanwhile, Eastern European countries which that have only recently joined the EU — such as Lithuania, Slovakia and Latvia – have not been required to use the waste hierarchy as a guiding principle. It isn’t straightforward to implement the waste hierarchy within a country: new laws must be brought in, systems for data collection and monitoring set up, and separate collection and sorting systems for different kinds of waste established. There are some good examples of what works though. Countries with strong political leadership and cross-party agreement on environmental issues – such as Germany, Denmark, Norway and Switzerland – tend to manage waste well. What’s more, countries which view waste as a resource have found novel and productive uses for it.  Belgium recycles precious metals such as gold and platinum from electronics; Germany harvests biogas from the breakdown of organic materials; Wales has focused on getting people to sort waste correctly for more effective recycling and to lower greenhouse gas emissions. And the clever use of automated technology, such as underground vacuum-powered waste disposal systems, have helped keep streets clear in cities such as Barcelona, London and Copenhagen. The protection of our environment is becoming an increasingly important global priority, and the political, commercial and health benefits of effective waste management are clear. With time, these facts should give countries the incentives they need to manage their waste effectively. Future waste management will become more about lifestyle choices and less about managing the wastes we generate."
"In a bid to tackle its record air pollution, Delhi has banned cars from travelling on alternate days over the first two weeks of this year. It’s better than nothing, but it won’t be enough. The Indian capital has the dubious accolade of being regularly-cited as the most polluted city in the world, with air pollution causing thousands of excess deaths each year. While it might be easy to blame this on increased vehicle use, dirty industries or a growing population, the truth is that Delhi is a toxic pollutant punchbowl with lots of different ingredients. Delhi’s landscape, weather, energy consumption culture, and growing urban population combines to elevate concentrations of air pollutants, including the especially harmful ultrafine particles. I recently published a study with colleagues from the UK and India looking at the factors behind Delhi’s air pollution issues. We were interested in why the city’s air is so much worse than in coastal megacities in India and elsewhere.  Coastal cities such as Mumbai have at least a chance to “replace” smog with relatively unpolluted sea breezes, whereas there are limited avenues for flushing away polluted air in landlocked Delhi. In fact, the regions surrounding the capital are sometimes even more polluted than the city itself. Most of Delhi’s brick kilns, for example, are actually found in upwind areas surrounding the city. Pollution from outside the city itself is down to the use of raw wood, agricultural or plastic waste as industrial fuel, the use of cow dung for cooking stoves and the widespread use of diesel generators due to unreliable infrastructure.  The city’s “breathability” is further inhibited by dense built-up areas. This is exacerbated by emissions from late evening and overnight traffic which tends to linger at ground level due to the much cooler air above it. Pollution intensifies during winter when farmers burn off husks from paddy fields upwind of Delhi. The very light wind speed and colder winter season leads to stable atmospheric conditions that let pollution hang around at “breathing” height.  The city’s alternate-day car ban, where vehicles with odd-numbered plates are only allowed to drive on odd dates and vice versa, is intended to keep 20% of cars off the road. After exemptions for women drivers, VIPs, emergency vehicles, disabled drivers and so on, this is equivalent to about 6% of Delhi’s total vehicles. Reports are thus far divided on its effectiveness. Some point to increased pollution levels on January 1 compared with December 31 while others show a marginal decrease. We’ll have to wait and see. But expectations may be too high. Even in the best case scenario the concentration of polluting particles in the city’s air would only be halved. “Only”? Well Delhi needs a staggering 30-fold reduction to meet the WHO’s safety limits.  Some of the confusion over whether “pollution” levels increased, decreased or remained unchanged is because reports aren’t clear about whether they refer to large or small particulate matter.  This car ban may help cut emissions of the smallest particles because combustion of fuel in vehicles produces these directly. However, it’s highly unlikely that it will help with the larger particles (“PM10”), which come more from tyre wear and road dust flung back into the atmosphere, and less from tailpipe emissions. The 6,000 extra compressed natural gas busses introduced during this period to compensate for the banned cars easily will offset the road dust and tyre wear gains. Delhi’s pollution problem won’t be seriously addressed until ultra-clean electric public transport becomes the norm and, more importantly, the city’s metro system is substantially expanded.  For now, however, people must be protected in whatever ways they can be. Simple remedies such as “greening” unpaved roadside areas through a natural or artificial grass canopy could possibly help in limiting coarse dust particles during dry and windy seasons. Natural measures, such as the development of wetlands and trees are also effective. There is also a cultural context here. Even the best science and technology won’t reduce emissions and improve air quality by themselves. India must figure out how new developments fit into the country’s economic development, while raising awareness of public health risks and changing attitudes towards and regulation of poor quality fuels. It is a complicated, pick-and-mix set of problems that will prove difficult to combat without innovative, encompassing and quick action."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe latest dubious climate scare story just out involves a far-fetched thought-spiel that creates a scenario of what would happen if all the world’s fossil fuels were burned – that scenario all based on an inflated CO2 climate sensitivity and crystal ball quality science.
The theorized result would be the possible melting of Antarctic ice and a 120+meter rise in sea level – “over thousands of years“. Little wonder already a number of scientists have dismissed the report as wildly speculative and of no value.
Well, in an equally far-fetched scenario people should instead consider the grave consequences of what would result if NO fossil fuels were burned, i.e. the opposite of burning all the fossil fuels. What would happen if the supply of fossil fuels were suddenly cut off today in our modern and prosperous society? The consequences would be cataclysmic and would occur immediately, and not over hundreds or thousands of years.
First without fossil fuels a majority of the world’s power plants (powered by coal, oil and gas) would stop. This would lead to widespread, permanent blackouts. Industries and the their output of life-sustaining goods would grind to a halt. Household appliances would cease to operate, meaning perishables stored in our refrigerators and freezers would begin to spoil within a matter of days, if not hours. Water would cease coming out of the taps because the public water works would be idled by the power loss. Cooking, bathing and sanitation would stop. Toilets would become inoperable. Sanitation services would not take our refuse away. Garbage would pile up within days.
Would you be able to just drive to the supermarket and get the things you need? Traffic control systems and signals would switch off and traffic would turn into mayhem. Within hours cars and trucks would run out of fuel and stall, leaving millions of motorists stranded over tens of thousands of miles of streets littered with abandoned vehicles. Stranded motorists would be left to fend for themselves. Grocery store shelves, not being refilled by delivery trucks, would quickly be looted.

Entire information and communication systems would be dead, ATM machines would stop, lights and power at schools and hospitals would go out. The healthcare system would collapse immediately. Forget calling the authorities. Emergency vehicles would cease to operate because they would have no fuel. Police, fire and ambulances would not be able to respond to calls. Law enforcement would be paralyzed, which would lead to instantaneous anarchy and mayhem. Rapists, murderers and criminals would have a field day. Violent gangs would soon take over. Loved ones on business trips, vacations, universities, weekend trips would never be seen again because there would be no way for them to return, except by taking the perilous journey through the mayhem on foot. All air traffic would be grounded. Most would be stranded and left to fend for themselves.
Next imagine it’s wintertime with temperatures well below freezing and the wind outside is howling. Your home is without heat, lighting, electricity or water. How are you going to prepare your next meal, wash your clothes, bathe or stay warm? Immediately homes would turn cold and millions and frozen water pipes would burst. Millions of people would start chopping tress down to burn for heat to stay warm. In no time our skies would be choked by ash and particulates.
In the summer within hours millions would begin to suffer from hunger and dehydration. To comprehend the utter hell you would find yourself in, imagine what your next step would be when you find that your fridge is empty and there’s no more water and electricity? You’re hungry and thirsty, you’re craving for food and your children are sick. What are you going to do? Walk to the supermarket? These will be long since looted. Any meat and dairy products left at the markets will be rotted and the place overrun by rats and insects. To quench your thirst you might consider drinking the untreated water from a local stream. Good luck with that. You can go outside and make a fire to sterilize the water, but you’re hungry and there’s nothing to eat. Suddenly your dog or cat starts looking like a meal, or worse, you start looking like a meal for all the abandoned dogs now running stray. Humans would start cannibalizing, with the strong preying on the weak. Syria and ISIS in comparison would look like a Love Parade parade event!
The regions with nuclear power would be better off – at least at first – but not for long as they would soon would be overrun by a tsunami of millions of blackout refugees. Chaos would ensue. Society would break down into a free-for-all.
By now you get the picture. Hundreds of millions would perish within a matter days and weeks – killed by exposure, dehydration, starvation, disease or murder. Billions would die within weeks and months.
So what do you prefer? That scenario, or a sea level rise of 100 meters over 5000 years?

"It must have been 1996 or 1997 when I first met someone from Monsanto. The anti-GM movement in the UK had by then already acquired some momentum and Monsanto was cast as the prime villain for seeking to import GM soya into Europe, though other seed producers were receiving similar treatment. I asked my contact why Monsanto allowed itself to be castigated in such a way. “It never occurred to us that anybody would be interested in plant breeding,” he replied. “They never had been in the past.”  Though hindsight is a wonderful thing, the industry should maybe not have been so surprised at the opposition when it began to market its insect-resistant and herbicide-tolerant crops in the mid-1990s. Some readers might recall efforts in the mid-1980s to delete a gene that made plants more susceptible to frost damage, which led to the development of “Ice Minus” bacteria. The spectacle of scientists in moon suits spraying Ice Minus on strawberry and potato plants in California made global headlines. Despite the fact that the bacteria did improve the plants’ protection against frost, long legal battles with opponents concerned about the effects on the environment were one of the main reasons the project was abandoned.  You can trace the anti-GM movement to two things. First, increasing disillusion, especially in Europe, with the progress of left-wing ideologies in the former Soviet Union and its allies. And second, a growing awareness of environmental problems in the years following the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson’s landmark attack on synthetic pesticides, Silent Spring. These created a breeding ground in which movements like anti-GM could flourish: as the socialist cause faded, environmentalism began to take its place.  Helping this along were scores of green politicians who saw political advantage in adopting postures which could frighten the population with threats to their food, and commercial interests such as the organic food industry which may have seen GM as a threat to their own brands and market shares – although it didn’t explain its opposition in that way.  This was the potential maelstrom into which agribiotech companies launched their first projects. The objections erupted primarily in Europe, reaching the US only ten years later (in the form of opponents seeking local GM bans and a nationwide campaign for GM labelling). Yet even in Europe, the opposition was far from universal in the early days. Between 1995 and 1997, for example, GM tomato purée was sold in two UK supermarket chains without incident.  It was only in 1997 when the anti-GM row really got going over the import of GM soya into Europe. At the time, some environmental pressure groups were in need of a new vehicle through which to channel protest – for example Greenpeace had backtracked and apologised for publicising a seriously mistaken estimate of the amount of oil left onboard the Brent Spar storage buoy. Accordingly, these organisations adopted a vigorous and at times violent opposition to all things GM, including imports and, above all, their cultivation on European soil. They frightened enough people to create a public outcry. The media became largely anti-GM, in Europe at least. Retailers began to remove GM products from their shelves, although their approach was far from coherent. The seed producers battled on but to little effect. Fast-forward 15 years and the environment has improved somewhat for GM in Europe. The UK media, for instance, now tends to be more in favour than against. There is more pro-GM media coverage than there once was even in Germany, a country still generally more determinedly opposed than England (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also take a more anti-approach).  Supermarket opposition has softened in the UK, too. Recent changes to EU rules have made GM crop cultivation more likely in a handful of countries, including England, the Czech Republic, Romania and Spain. My sense is that much of the European public has become bored with the issue, even in countries whose governments remain opposed. GM is meanwhile very successful in the Americas and parts of Asia and Australia, while growing perceptibly in Africa.  Through all of this, the major agribiotech companies have focused on quietly selling themselves to people prepared to listen, and publishing various accounts of their technical and scientific advances. In Europe, they work with the industry group EuropaBio to represent their interests in the corridors and conference centres of the EU. In the past few years, the industry seems essentially to have given up on cultivating GM crops in the European countries where it is not welcome, focusing instead on the places that want the technology. But it is keen to maintain imports into Europe of GM products, particularly animal feedstuffs, which are widely used.  Agribiotech no doubt did make mistakes in the early days of GM by failing to anticipate the strength of the opposition. But maybe the need to commercialise the products made this unavoidable. Certainly the industry remains unpopular in some quarters: Monsanto in particular is still seen by activist protesters as a large and visible target. But whether the general public subscribes to such views, or ever really did, is much less certain. Ultimately that is the only thing that matters, even if there is still some way to go to persuade everyone yet.  For more coverage of the debate around GM crops, click here."
"There’s a curious paradox at the heart of climate change. Despite scientists asserting the need for urgent action and the widespread acceptance of the reality of climate change by people worldwide, it is a subject that we tend not to talk about with friends, family or colleagues. Just 6% of the British public say they discuss climate change often, whereas approaching half (44%) do so at most rarely. Likewise, two-thirds of Americans rarely or never discuss the subject.  Perhaps we are too fearful of appearing worthy or hectoring to express our concerns, or maybe the issues seem too complex and overwhelming. Or we have grown tired of seeing polar bears floating on melting icebergs. Whatever the reasons for our reticence, however, it is hard to see how a global impetus for public engagement and action can be realised if it remains out of bounds for discussion by all but an interested few. The Paris summit meant climate change was headline news for a week or two. Perhaps you did find yourself reflecting on the unusual weather or the fate of low-lying Pacific nations. But now that Christmas has come and gone, are you still worrying about these things? The discussion can’t tail off from here – after Paris, we need public conversation about climate change more than ever before. Whether you think the agreement was a resounding success or are troubled by its limitations, it is clear that the hard work still lies ahead. Amid the focus in news reports on compromises struck and the commitment to keep temperatures rises “well below” 2°C one aspect of the process has received less attention. The role of civil society, never more vocal than at the Paris talks, will be crucial for words to become action. As protestors took to the streets in the final hours of the negotiations, inside the sprawling complex north of Paris, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon called on grassroots organisations to keep up the pressure on governments to act, arguing that “active engagement” was required from across society in order to hold governments to account. Adjoined to the sealed-off buildings housing the international delegates, the Climate Generations hall provided the space for organisations and individuals from across the world to make their voices heard. This should be seen as more than the usual rhetoric and well-meaning outreach accompanying a fleeting international limelight. Article 12 of the Paris Agreement affirms that its signatories commit to climate change education, increased public awareness, and public participation in order to achieve its aims. We can be sure that organisations such as Greenpeace and 350.org need no encouragement to do just this. But what of the wider public and their role in the process? Are we ready to play our part? Meeting the 2°C target will require an unprecedented level of disruptive change. This won’t be achieved unless we embark upon a process of meaningful public dialogue to work out our collective response. In doing so, we will inevitably encounter the old disagreements about climate change, but this is all the more reason to talk openly about the many challenges that remain. Perhaps most significantly, and for the first time in human history, the Paris talks have led to a unanimously-endorsed policy position which appears completely at odds with continued fossil fuel dominance: the world aims to be “net zero” in emissions of carbon dioxide by the end of the century.  But despite the rush to celebrate the end of the fossil fuel era, the truth is likely to be more complicated. In addition to this “net zero” target, there are precisely zero mentions of fossil fuels in the final Paris text, and zero indications of how the production of fossil fuels (as opposed to the emissions they cause) will be curtailed by leaving most of these in the ground.  Have we even begun to imagine how this can be achieved, to consider the implications for changing the ways in which millions of people live? How do we, as citizens, want this to be done? None of the options currently available are straightforward or palatable to many – whether through reducing our consumption, or at the system level through an acceleration of renewable energy, nuclear power, or the use of (still speculative) carbon extraction technologies. The conversations that are necessary as we attempt to restructure our societies – if we attempt to do so – are where the real discussion on climate change is now required. This will not result in neat texts endorsed by all, but will instead give rise to disputes grounded in different values, and played out in the familiar fight between conservatives and progressives. Finding common ground on these more contentious topics is where the energies of climate campaigners and communicators are best placed now that the skeleton of a more sustainable world has been assembled."

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe Nobel Peace Prize Committee is (in)famous for its controversial choices when selecting the winner of the prestigious prize. Many among us recall how the Oslo-based Committee once awarded the Prize to PLO leader and terrorist Yasser Arafat.
“One Peace Prize winner bombs another”
Today German online flagship daily ‘Die Welt’ presents an article about the worst choices made by the Committee. For example mong them they select US President Barack Obama, who was given the award in 2009. Die Welt writes:
“…when one Nobel Peace Prize laureate (Barack Obama, 2009) bombs another (Doctors Without Borders, 1999) in Afghanistan, thus killing dozens of people, then doubt is warranted over whether the Prize really delivers what it promises.”
Surely one has to wonder if amid the Middle East chaos Obama has really acted in the Prize’s original spirit: “done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.”
Die Welt presents its list of laureates to whom they feel the award was a blunder. Here are the top 5:
1. Henry Kissinger
 2. Yasser Arafat
 3. Al Gore and Rajendra Pachauri
4. Wangari Maathai
5. Barack Obama

Gore and Pachauri come in third. Die Welt writes that the selection of former vice president Gore had little to do with promoting ‘fraternity among nations’. Moreover the Die Welt adds:
Since then Gore’s climate-political engagement has diminished markedly, as well as that of then IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri, who was sharply criticized because he used dubious data to promote doomsday scenarios such as predictions of the destruction of the Netherlands or the desertification of the Amazon rainforest.
Probably to avoid going over the top with its criticism, Die Welt remained diplomatic and elected not bring up the now disgraced former IPCC chairman Pachauri’s sexual harassment affair and crony green energy deals.
Also the once wildly popular Barack Obama has lost his shine in Europe. Die Welt placed the current US president at number 5 on the list of Worst Peace Prize decisions, and as the turmoil in the Middle East spirals and race-baited tensions simmer in the US, he may eventually reach the top of the list before his presidency ends.
Die Welt summarizes:
Looking at the decisions over the past years, one could get the impression that the Nobel Peace Prize has turned into one for democracy, environmental protection and women’s rights. No doubt these are honorable targets, but they are not in the spirit of Alfred Nobel. What is probably the greatest scandal in history of the Nobel Peace Prize is that Indian peace activist Mahatma Gandhi never received it.”
No surprise here. Unfortunately the committee in Oslo is all too often caught up in political correctness and flippant activism, and so do not make the right choices. Lately that has been all too frequent.

"A very unusual exchange is about to take place over the Atlantic. The UK is sending some 700kg of highly enriched uranium to be disposed of in the US, the largest amount that has ever been moved out of the country. In return, the US is sending other kinds of enriched uranium to Europe to help diagnose people with cancer.  The vast majority of the UK’s waste comes from its fleet of nuclear power stations. Most of it is stored at the Sellafield site in north-west England. But the material being sent to the US is a particularly high (weapons usable) grade of enriched uranium that you wouldn’t want to move to Sellafield from its current location at Dounreay in the north of Scotland without building a new storage facility – presumably more expensive than the cost of transportation. The decision to move this radioactive waste out of the UK has been presented as making it harder for nuclear materials to get into the hands of terrorists, but this is implausible. The UK is capable of managing homegrown highly enriched uranium itself. The plan also contradicts the principle that countries are responsible for managing their own nuclear legacy.  The announcement draws new attention to an old issue: how to find a long-term solution to nuclear waste. Countries with atomic weapons or civilian nuclear power have been wrestling with this for several decades. This is partly because the problem was neglected for years, but more fundamentally because governments have failed to develop a strategy acceptable to the communities affected.  This reflects the uniqueness of the problem, of course – we are talking about substances which could harm human health for tens of thousands of years into the future. It raises profound ethical issues of equity between generations.  The scientific community does in fact agree on how to dispose of these materials safely: deep underground in appropriate geology such as clay or granite, with well engineered radiation barriers as an extra defence. Yet only Sweden and Finland, with political systems built on more trust and consensus than most countries, have a clear repository plan – and it will be several years before they become operational.  Most of the storage facilities at Sellafield are designed to last mere decades. The UK has been sporadically focused on deep disposal since the early 1980s, but for a long time approached it top-down and secretively. This became known as the “DAD” method – decide, announce, defend. But it has always led to “abandon” when local communities, having had no part in the siting decision, have rebelled successfully.  It was not until 2008 that the government introduced a system of rules under which local communities would conditionally volunteer a site and then negotiate a deal with the authorities. So far it has produced no result: attempts by district councils around Sellafield to volunteer it were overruled in 2013 by Cumbria county council, the local-authority tier above them, and no other communities have come forward. The government has reserved the right to override the voluntary process but shows no sign of doing so yet.   In such circumstances it becomes tempting to look for short cuts. One occasionally raised is to put all the world’s problematic waste somewhere very remote like the west Australian desert. This is a non-starter. The Czech and Slovak experience illustrated this. As a single country they planned a single repository, but after their “velvet divorce” each insisted it would not permanently manage the other’s waste. Such an international solution also contradicts the aforementioned issue of being responsible for your own legacy.  The other major hope is that science will find a convincing way either to use waste as fuel for reactors, and/or that “partitioning and transmutation” would drastically reduce the half-lives of the relevant isotopes. Yet these approaches are complex and expensive, involving molten salt reactors or accelerator-driven systems. And critically, there would still be some volume of long-lived waste that needed to be managed – no method can yet promise to drastically reduce the half-lives of all the different waste types. The only credible way forward is deep burial. In the absence of a deep-disposal plan, the UK has a more immediately pressing issue – what to do with Sellafield’s contaminated materials and waste from the UK’s near-70 years in the nuclear power and weapons business, much of which is housed in dilapidated facilities that are not fit for purpose. The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA)
expects it will cost some £68 billion to clean up Sellafield by stabilising and safely packaging the waste and building new stores. This will only be completed by around 2120.    This problem is at least now getting serious attention and resource – despite the climate of public austerity. Currently the country is spending over £1.5 billion a year on the site, which is one of the most hazardous in Europe.  Sellafield stores a further 140 tonnes of waste plutonium that also stems from British and some overseas nuclear power. If used in bombs this amount could obliterate humanity several times over. The NDA is now focusing on what to do about this too, after years of political inattention. Yet the decision-making is laboured and the currently favoured solution of using the plutonium as fuel for conventional reactors lacks credibility – no operator wants to use plutonium-based fuel because it is more difficult and expensive to manage than conventional fuel; and moving it around the country is a security risk.  So nuclear waste remains the Achilles heel of the nuclear industry, in the UK and elsewhere. While the financial problems behind the proposed new nuclear station Hinkley Point C attract most of the headlines, the waste problem hangs over the industry behind the scenes. Until we find a way forward that is scientifically and politically acceptable, it will continue to do so."
"Fish is as tasty and popular as ever, but no one seems to like the policies that regulate the industry behind it. For decades, European management of fisheries has been lambasted by fishers, conservationists and scientists, including us.  The centrepiece of this system, the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy, is particularly unpopular. Some scientists even argue it is designed to fail. Opponents blame it for not only mismanaging Europe’s highly productive seas, but also for giving away “our fish”, with the subject recently taking centre stage in an unlikely viral Brexit campaign video.  You might think that the chance to take back control of the fish in UK seas would be one of the most solid reasons to vote “Out” in June’s referendum on EU membership. So what’s the catch? First, the idea that fish in British waters have been fished into near-extinction by pesky foreign boats simply doesn’t match up with reality. At least not anymore.  Yes, fish numbers aren’t what they were in the time of Moby Dick. However, a recent analysis of 118 years of statistics revealed the vast majority of the decline occurred prior to the Common Fisheries Policy’s implementation in 1983. In fact, the policy is now overall helping, not harming, the country’s fisheries. Since EU policy was reformed in 2002, the health of many fish stocks has improved. By 2011 the majority of assessed fisheries were considered to be sustainably fished. Take the case of North Sea cod: once the “poster child” for overfishing and all that was wrong with European policy, it is now recovering strongly and likely to be certified as sustainable next year.  The EU is now phasing out the discarding of unwanted fish and setting quotas more in line with scientific advice. The aim is to ensure maximum sustainable yield of all stocks by 2020. Ownership of UK fishing quotas is controversial and often misunderstood. After total EU fishing limits are decided by the Council of fisheries ministers, it is up to each member state to distribute its share among its own fleet.  This is not an EU decision. The fact that a single giant Dutch-owned vessel nets a quarter of the English quota (6% of the UK total) might be shocking, especially considering the UK’s quota is in theory shared between more than 6,000 vessels, but the UK government could easily change how it allocates fish. In fact, the alternative allocation systems suggested by some pro-Brexit groups are already in place elsewhere in Europe. Another common argument for Brexit is that it would give the UK sole control of the fish in its waters. However, these fish are not “British”; they don’t respect national boundaries. Mackerel, herring, cod and other commercial species are all highly mobile, and move easily across borders, especially in places such as the North, Celtic and Irish Seas, where “exclusive economic zones” are jammed together like sardines in a can. So unlike more isolated countries such as Iceland and Norway, the UK was always going to have to share its fish with its neighbours, especially as we moved into an era of global maritime regulation. A post-Brexit UK might still have to agree quotas with its neighbours, but could it prevent foreign boats from fishing in its waters? Maybe. But only with huge investment in monitoring and control public bodies such as the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) – organisations which are being cut at present.  Whether the UK would want this sort of escalation is a different question, as it would also mean British boats could no longer fish in the waters of other European nations. This is a major concern in the fishing industry as 20% of the fish caught by the UK fleet is landed elsewhere in the EU. The reality is that a Brexit would require a complete re-negotiation of fishing rights, with uncertain outcomes. Some of these rights extend back to the Middle Ages and banning foreign vessels from UK waters may well be incompatible with international law.  Such negotiations may harm trading relationships with Europe. At present the UK exports around 80% of its wild-caught seafood, with four of the top five destinations being European countries.  Remaining in the EU also has big benefits for the marine ecosystems that the fishing industry ultimately relies on. The Habitats Directive protects key habitats and species such as reefs and Atlantic salmon, while the Water Framework Directive and Marine Strategy Framework Directive commit EU members to restore and protect the environment. It seems unlikely that the UK’s current Conservative government, at least, would continue similarly progressive measures after a Brexit. It’s no surprise the “In” campaign is gaining support from a range of environmental groups – the weight of evidence is on their side. In contrast, many fishermen have strong feelings about the EU, but the main industry organisations and decision makers are remaining neutral. We’ve come a long way since the bad old days of excessive quotas and widespread illegal fishing. As things become more sustainable, fish numbers are rebounding, leading to increasing UK fishing quotas and growing profits (now the highest in the EU).  The history of the EU’s fishing policy is one of criticism and improvement. It is therefore unclear why the UK would want to abandon ship at this point."
"Insects, which include more than a million known species, represent roughly two-thirds of the described biodiversity on Earth. But they have a big PR problem – many think of insects as little more than crop-eating, disease-carrying jumper-munchers. But in reality, species fitting this bill are but a tiny part of an enormous picture.  A dominant narrative has emerged in an effort to clear the good name of our six-legged friends. Insects are the unsung heroes, the little things that run the world. This fact is undeniable. Insects are critical to the existence of the world as we know it, whether through pollinating plants, controlling populations of agricultural pests, or helping with the decomposition of animal waste.  These numerous benefits provided by our environment are known as ecosystem services. A widely cited paper from 2006 estimates that these insect services are worth an annual US$57 billion to the US economy alone. These valuations are an important step in starting conversations about the importance of insect conservation.  However economic arguments can only take us so far. Imagine a field of tomatoes. For an appreciable harvest flowers must be pollinated. To achieve this farmers might choose to enlist the help of native pollinators by setting aside part of their land for flowering plants. In some cases this works exceptionally well. For instance, a recent paper has shown that converting 5-8% of arable land to pollinator habitat supports greater or equivalent crop yields, even after accounting for loss of field area. But how much insect diversity do we need to support ecosystem services? Generally speaking, a more diverse species assemblage means higher levels of functioning. Keeping with our pollinator analogy, we might find that two species of bee can provide a greater service of pollination than one species – even if the overall numbers of bees are the same. A three-species community might perform better still.  But not every species plays an equally important economic role and the presence of a dozen rarer bee species may provide no additional monetary benefit. Recent research shows the majority of pollination services of agricultural crops by wild bees are performed by a tiny handful of species; the authors argue that crop pollination is not a sufficient argument to justify bee conservation. This exemplifies the danger of relying too heavily on economic arguments. If we only worry about the species which provide us a given service, we risk losing a large amount of diversity. I am asked this question frequently. Its ubiquity provides two important pieces of information. The first is great news: the public recognises that insects are key components of our ecosystems. The second piece is concerning. It shows that we’re not doing enough to demonstrate that insects have any real “purpose” aside from some service to humans. And, given the overwhelming diversity in the insect world, it’s likely there are many species which don’t ever make a significant contribution to our lives.  There are many ways that one can advocate the importance of those insects. One can correctly suggest that insects are vital links in food webs. Or that by having multiple species present there is insurance for providing services when systems are disturbed. But there is a simple solution which is hugely successful in encouraging people to value insect conservation: getting them to learn more about insects. Rather than focusing primarily on their functional value, we could instead place a greater emphasis on sharing the fascinating behaviour and wonderful appearances commonplace in the insect world. Once people become better acquainted with these qualities, they fall in love. And when people love something, they will fight for its protection regardless of whether or not it contributes to the provision of a particular ecosystem service. Insects can make us laugh, like the fuzzy caterpillars within the genus Megalopyge. These ridiculous-looking larvae are covered in irritating hairs used to deter predators. One especially fuzzy species has been often likened to the hairstyle of a certain presidential-hopeful. Or consider the chirping call of lesser water boatman males. This species calls at over 100 decibels, as loud as a car horn. It produces this noise with its genitalia. Insects often surprise us. When you’re as tiny as an insect, everything seems to want to eat you. Insects have evolved endless strategies to avoid this unfortunate fact. For instance, bombardier beetles fend off enemies by blasting a boiling chemical cocktail from their abdomen, and some species of hawk-moth caterpillars do a truly convincing impression of a snake.  The closer we look at the world around us, the more wonderful pieces of natural history we discover. When we experience the fascinating world of insects firsthand, the dominant dialogue of “insects as ecosystem service providers” begins to shift. Instead, we start to recognise the beauty, mystery and wonder of the insect world for what it is: beautiful, mysterious and wonderful. Through building a stronger appreciation of the important inherent value of insect biodiversity, hopefully “what do they do for us?” will share more space with “what can we do for them?”."
"Mark Carney has been appointed as UN special envoy for climate action and finance as he prepares to step down as governor of the Bank of England in January. Carney replaces billionaire Michael Bloomberg in the part time pro bono climate action role after the former New York mayor stepped down to focus on the US presidential race. The governor has been signed up to galvanise action among financial institutions ahead of the 26th round of global climate talks in November 2020. His main focus will be on mobilising private finance to invest in schemes that will help achieve the Paris climate agreement goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C. His remit will include building frameworks for financial reporting and risk management. Carney said the new role, for which he will be paid a token $1 a year once his term at the Bank of England ends, would provide “a platform to bring the risks from climate change and the opportunities from the transition to a net-zero economy into the heart of financial decision-making.” He said: “The disclosures of climate risk must become comprehensive, climate risk management must be transformed, and investing for a net-zero world must go mainstream. The Bank of England, the UK government and the UK financial sector can play leading roles in making these imperatives happen.” Carney has previously spoken out about the need for change, warning in October that the global financial system was backing carbon-producing projects that would raise the temperature of the planet by over 4C. Carney is due to end his six-and-a-half-year stint at Threadneedle Street at the end of January but the government has postponed the announcement of a successor until after the general election. Carney has twice extended his term but the Treasury has indicated it is confident that the new government will be in a position to make an appointment from a slate of candidates soon after the election on 12 December. The shortlist is thought to include Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority; Minouche Shafik, head of the London School of Economics; Shriti Vadera, chair of Santander UK; and Ben Broadbent and Jon Cunliffe, both deputy governors at the Bank."

It’s going to take some time to digest/read through the content. By then it’ll likely either be ratified, or discarded.
Reading it I couldn’t help but think this is a document of madness. Global temperature cannot be regulated. It’s delusional to think so.
Unless you’re going to make money from it, why would anyone want to sign it and ensure a place in history’s Laughing Stock Hall of Fame? The passage that sparked this thought clearly shows the levels human delusion can reach, Article 2, Paragraph 1, part (a):

Signatories to this treaty will go down as historical fools who let themselves get caught up in hysteria.

"With a climate changing faster than most crops can adapt and food security under threat around the world, scientists have found hope in a living museum dedicated to a staple eaten by millions daily: the humble potato. High in the Peruvian Andes, agronomists are looking to the ancestral knowledge of farmers to identify genetic strains which could help the tubers survive increasingly frequent and intense droughts, floods and frosts.   The Potato Park in Cusco is a 90 sq km (35 sq mile) expanse ranging from 3,400 to 4,900 metres (16,000 feet) above sea level. It has “maintained one of the highest diversities of native potatoes in the world, in a constant process of evolution,” says Alejandro Argumedo, the founder of Asociación Andes, an NGO which supports the park.  “By sowing potatoes at different altitudes and in different combinations, these potatoes create new genetic expressions which will be very important to respond to the challenges of climate change.” Under a cobalt sky by an icy mountain lagoon, a father and his son-in-law hoe thick brown soil. They pull out reddish potatoes and throw them into waiting sacks. The pucasawsiray potatoes they gather are among the 1,367 varieties in the park, which lies in the Sacred Valley of the Incas. The intensely cultivated patchwork of tiny fields and graded terraces is a living laboratory of potato diversity. The potato was domesticated 7,000 years ago by the ancestors of these Peruvian peasant farmers on the shores of Lake Titicaca, between modern-day Peru and Bolivia, say archaeologists. The Potato Park is considered a secondary centre of origin for the potato, which today is grown on every continent on Earth except Antarctica. Scientists at the US space agency Nasa and the Peru-based International Potato Centre have even been testing whether potatoes can be grown on Mars. The Quechua-speaking descendants of the Incas have myriad descriptive names for the cornucopia of potatoes grown and eaten in Peru’s southern Andes, from a squat, greyish tuber named after an alpaca’s nose to a yellow indented tatty called puma maqui, or puma’s paw. There is even a maddeningly knobbly potato known as pusi qhachun wachachi, whose name literally means “make your daughter-in-law cry”, as it has frustrated so many prospective wives who have tried to pass the test of trying to peel it. They come in every colour and texture; reds, yellows, blues and purples, sometimes shocking pink ringed with white when cut in half. Some have a powdery texture, others are waxy and some moray or chuño are are too bitter to eat until they are soaked, freeze-dried on rooftops and trampled on to remove their skins. These can be stored for months and used in winter soups. But now these potatoes are bearing the brunt of global heating, which is drawing pests further uphill, forcing farmers to sow the crop in the upper reaches of the park on the limit of arable land. The park residents are conducting tests to see how resistant the native varieties are to frost, hail and intense sunlight and also to the Andean potato weevil, whose larvae eat through the tubers underground. “These crops have always adapted,” says Marie Haga, the executive director of the Crop Trust. “Now climate change is so fast that these poor plants are not able to adapt. “That’s why we need the diversity, because the diversity is what we use when we breed new plants which can tolerate new climates,” she adds. The possible solution may be in what locals call the wild “grandfather” of the domesticated potato, which still grows in the highlands and is grazed on by alpacas and donkeys. The plant’s green fruit looks more like a very small tomato than a potato but, as villager Nazario Quispe explains, its seed is spread in animal dung and it often grows in their corrals. Quispe says they continue to mix the crops with the wild relatives to make them more resistant. “In laboratories, scientists are trying to solve this through gene transfer and genetic engineering, but the peasants here have been doing this kind of work for thousands of years,” says Argumedo. The results are stored in an on-site seed bank where each potato is kept in carefully coded paper bags, cooled by trenches filled with icy water and lit by rooftop windows to prevent them from taking seed. In 2017, 650 examples were taken to the global seed vault on the Norwegian island of Svalbard inside the Arctic circle, where they are stored at -18C. At the same time in Peru’s capital, Lima, the International Potato Centre, known by its Spanish acronym CIP, houses more than 4,600 types of potato and has the world’s largest in vitro gene bank. The CIP is working in Africa and Asia where the potato is helping to combat hunger and generate income as a cash crop. It produces fast-maturing, biofortified potatoes which have improved productivity – particularly in China, which is the world’s biggest grower, accounting for 22% of global potato production. “China suffers from a severe shortage of land and water and the potato is particularly resilient to droughts,” says Mei Xurong, the vice-president of the country’s Academy of Agricultural Sciences. “The question for China is how to enrich the biodiversity when you produce potatoes,” he says. “This is a major challenge.” The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that 75% of crop diversity was lost between 1900 and 2000 and that as much as 22% of the wild relatives of food crops will disappear by 2055 because of the changing climate. As soil degradation intensifies and crop resilience becomes ever more important, the work being done by the potato guardians in a small park in Peru may play an important role in feeding the rest of the world."
"Conservationists say an official government report to the UN’s world heritage committee to be released next week must show Australia has fresh plans to attack the Great Barrier Reef’s two key threats – climate change and water quality. At a forum earlier this month environment ministers signed-off on the “state of conservation” report for the reef,which was then sent to Unesco’s world heritage committee. A report to be published on Friday by the World Wide Fund for Nature-Australia and the Australian Marine Conservation Society details what they say Australia needs to do to avoid the committee placing the reef on its “in danger” list when it meets in China next year. The report says Australia must revise its central Great Barrier Reef policy, the Reef 2050 plan, to fill a “gaping hole” left by the absence of efforts to keep global heating to 1.5C. Australia needs an “energy transition plan”, the report argues, that is compatible with the Paris climate agreement’s ambitious target. Richard Leck, WWF-Australia’s head of oceans, told Guardian Australia the government was now clearly acknowledging climate change as the reef’s greatest threat, and that temperatures needed to be kept to 1.5C. He said: “With all of that in front of us, the committee may be very concerned that Australia is acknowledging the need to limit global warming to 1.5C but, at this stage, is not walking the walk.” Mass coral bleaching along the reef in 2016 and again in 2017 killed half the shallow water corals, with northern sections hit hard. The following year, the number of new corals crashed by 89%. In July 2019, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority published a revised climate change position statement, when it stressed the need to stick to a 1.5C global warming target, adding: “If we are to secure a future for the Great Barrier Reef and coral reef ecosystems globally, there is an urgent and critical need to accelerate actions to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions.” In August, the authority’s five-yearly outlook report downgraded the long-term prospects for the reef from “poor” to “very poor”. Also that month, an official review of water quality along inshore reefs found conditions had failed to improve. In 2017 the world heritage committee asked for Australia to submit a detailed report on the state of the reef before 1 December, which should include progress on water-quality targets. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Earlier this month, environment ministers sent that report, which Unesco is expected to make public in the coming days. At the time, the Queensland environment minister, Leeanne Enoch, said her government’s newly-enacted farm pollution laws “along with other efforts including tree clearing laws and action on climate change” would “prevent it from being listed by the world heritage committee as in-danger next year.” The committee will review the reef again at its annual meeting, to be held in China in June next year. The world heritage committee resisted pressure to put the reef on its “in danger” list in 2015 after the Queensland and federal government had tabled its Reef 2050 plan, which set targets to improve water quality along the 2,300-kilometre reef. The last time the Great Barrier Reef was reviewed by Unesco, the world heritage committee said it “strongly encourages” Australia to “accelerate efforts” to meet the Reef 2050 plan’s targets “in particular regarding water quality”. It had one major flaw. It did not include climate change The report from WWF-Australia and AMCS also says extra funding should be given to enforcing water quality laws. A reforestation program should be introduced along riverbanks and other landscapes to reduce run-off into waterways that flow into the reef. Leck said the Reef 2050 plan was an “excellent” response, but added: “It had one major flaw. It did not include climate change. “Given what’s happened to the reef in the subsequent years, that is now a gaping hole. The next 2050 plan has to incorporate what the federal and Queensland government has recognised. A reef-safe strategy has to be 1.5C compatible. “The Australian government clearly acknowledges the reef’s greatest threat is climate change. It’s a no-brainer that we need a climate policy consistent with the reef’s survival.” Imogen Zethoven, AMCS director of strategy, said that to avoid a possible “in danger” listing, the Australian government needed to rapidly reduce emissions, transition to renewable energy and accelerate efforts to address local threats. In a 2017 review of the government’s climate change policies, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority wrote: “To ensure a future for the Great Barrier Reef (ie as a functioning reef ecosystem), the latest science indicates the stronger position in the Paris agreement to restrict the increase to 1.5C (or ideally less) above pre-industrial is essential.” The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that even at 1.5C of warming, coral reefs around the world would decline by 70 to 90%. At 2C, coral reefs would all but disappear. The world heritage committee has been slow to produce a new policy that would outline how it plans to incorporate climate change impacts into its decision making. In July, the Australian government told a world heritage meeting that climate change threats on individual sites should not be used to justify “in danger” listings. Stephen Oxley, from the environment and energy department, told the committee Australia was disappointed the policy had not been finalised. But the department told Guardian Australia its intervention was unrelated to the reef’s assessment at the 2020 meeting."
"After ignoring the climate crisis for decades, political parties have now filled their manifestos with environmental pledges. It is important to assess how effective these pledges would be. Our research – to be presented at the British Ecological Society’s meeting in Belfast on 11 December, a day before the election – shows that two solutions are effective in addressing environmental concerns. These are comprehensive Green New Deal plans which, alongside “green growth”, also stop fossil fuel subsidies and implement progressive green taxes. Nature-based solutions are also effective: these restore and better manage habitats such as forests and coastal ecosystems. The environment benefits most when both strategies are combined, and can also benefit society by, for example, reducing inequity.  For the main three UK-wide parties’ manifestos, Labour comes out the best, with a comprehensive “green industrial revolution” alongside some commitments to nature-based solutions. Next come the Liberal Democrats, with a greater commitment to reforesting, but weaker societal reforms than Labour. Last come the Conservatives, with weaker nature-based solutions than the Lib Dems, and a strong focus on economic growth, which we demonstrate decreases the environmental benefits of any other policies. Overall, however, the Green party’s policies are the best, covering Green New Deal principles, committing to nature-based solutions and refocusing economic performance away from the measurement of growth. These manifesto pledges from the Greens were put to the Commons in March 2019 in the decarbonisation and economic strategy bill. So, to protect the environment, a good question to ask your prospective MPs would be whether they would support this bill’s progress if it were reintroduced in the next parliament. Prof Rick Stafford, Dr Elena Cantarello, Elli Rivers, Abigail Croker, Tilak Ginige, Prof Chris Shiel Bournemouth University; Dr Emma McKinley Cardiff University; Dr Peter JS Jones University College London • Two chilling reports this week from the World Meteorological Organization and the UN Environment Programme both show that carbon emissions haven’t yet peaked, let alone begun the necessary decline needed to prevent climate chaos (UN urges drastic cut in emissions over next decade to avert disaster, 26 November). The former government chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, was incredibly blunt about the implications, warning that we ought to be afraid, not least because of the potential sea level rise of one or two metres, which would mean London having to be moved to higher ground. Particularly striking was Sir David’s concern at the lack of political leadership to seriously tackle these problems. The Conservative manifesto was pitifully weak on ideas and spending plans to tackle the climate crisis. Take the crucially important area of our homes. The Tories promise a paltry £6.3bn to make them more energy-efficient, which will do next to nothing to tackle the crisis. Compare this with the hundreds of billions needed, and promised in the Green party’s Green New Deal, to decarbonise every aspect of our economy and society over the next decade. The country has already endured a decade of cruel Conservative austerity. We cannot afford to now add recklessness on climate to the social deprivation this has already created. The choice on 12 December is stark yet simple. If you are worried about the future of the planet, our nation’s children and grandchildren and those around the world already affected by the climate crisis, then vote for a party that is committed to doing something about it. If not now, when? Caroline LucasGreen party parliamentary candidate for Brighton Pavilion • George Monbiot’s article (A vote for the planet means a vote for Labour or the Greens, Journal, 27 November) makes an interesting point about the contradictions in Labour’s manifesto policies to address the climate crisis. These contradictions have far-reaching consequences. Take Labour’s conditional support for airport expansion. Their “case by case” approach means that up and down the country, local authorities are left to struggle with planning applications for individual airport expansion plans. Up and down the country, groups and individuals concerned by this have to spend weeks and months, arguing the case against – and all within the constraints of the local planning process, which was never set up as a means of tackling the climate emergency. In the midst of a global climate crisis there is nothing local about airport expansion. It is a national issue which demands a national policy against any UK airport expansion.Tony JonesBristol  • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterPhytoplankton coping better than expected with ocean acidification
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof: Fritz Vahrenholt
[Translated, edited by P Gosselin]
Five years ago Greenpeace painted climate doom and gloom on the wall. Supposedly ocean acidification was posing a threat to the phytoplankton and thuswas a danger to the food supply for all sea life. In addition to its importance for nourishing sea life, the tiny algae are also one of the most important producers of oxygen. Estimates peg its contribution to the oxygen content of our atmosphere somewhere between 50 and 80 percent. Moreover they absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide.
In July 2010 Sibylle Zollinger of the Greenpeace website warned:
Climate change: ocean acidification damaging plankton.
For a second time, this summer Greenpeace traveled to the Arctic together with independent scientists. In one of the biggest European experiments, researchers from 12 nations investigated the consequences of ocean acidification over the past 6 weeks. Their conclusion: rising greenhouse gas emissions are having an unexpected powerful impact on plankton. […] At the so-called Mesokosmen – the world’s largest test tube – various degrees of ocean acidification were simulated. Greenpeace ship Esperanza will be bringing it back to Kiel this week. How is sea life in the Arctic coping with the lower pH value? What has been changing in the ecosystem? These were the questions that the largest collection of data concerning ocean acidification is seeking to answer. The results will evaluated and interpreted over the coming weeks. The first results, however, already show huge impacts: The phytoplankton, for example the diatom, is reproducing more slowly when the ocean is acidic Because these plankton are at the very bottom of the food chain, this may have massive consequences for the entire food supply and for the ecosystem.”
It is a good thing that scientists are looking into this. But what is not so good is that Greenpeace already announced “results” from the scientific expedition before any data had been evaluated and interpreted. This is an unscientific approach. Naturally there is a desire to produce big headlines, especially when the expensive Greenpeace ship was made available to the scientists. But that does not mean that proper scientific procedure can be thrown overboard and the title of a press release can claim a result that is not even at hand.
This is especially dubious because since then robust results have become available, and they happen to point to the opposite picture of what Greenpeace hastily claimed. On July 10, 2015, the University of Edinburgh announced the research results in a press release: the phytoplankton have a a far better ability to adapt to rising CO2 concentrations than what was previously assumed. A team of researchers led by C-Elisa Schaum grew more than 400 generations of the tiny algae under CO2 conditions that are projected to be seen in the year 2100. Here the plankton performed splendidly. The paper appeared in the ISME Journal of the Nature family of journals.

Here’s the press release from the University of Edinburgh:
Algae to cope well in climate change
Marine algae with a key role in supporting life on Earth may be better equipped to deal with climate change than expected, research shows.
Scientists investigated the likely future impact of changing environmental conditions on ocean phytoplankton, a microscopic plant that forms the basis of all the oceans’ food chains. Phytoplankton is important for absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, while generating much of the oxygen needed to sustain life on Earth. The study grew phytoplankton at the high carbon dioxide levels predicted for the year 2100 and beyond. The algae was allowed to evolve through 400 generations, with some exposed to varying levels of CO2 and some kept at constant CO2 levels.
Researchers found that phytoplankton exposed to fluctuating CO2 levels was better able to cope with further changes in conditions, compared with algae grown in stable CO2 levels. The finding suggests that populations of the algae will adapt more to the varied conditions expected in future than was previously thought based on experiments at stable conditions. Scientists found however that the algae developed in changing CO2 conditions evolved more and were smaller than those grown in stable conditions. These factors may impact on how well marine animals can feed off phytoplankton, and how efficiently the algae is able to take carbon out of the atmosphere and sink to the deep ocean.
Plankton in some regions of the ocean may evolve more than others under global climate change, because some regions of ocean are currently more variable than others. The studies, published in the International Society for Microbial Ecology journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society B, were supported by the Royal Society, the European Commission, and the Scottish Universities Life Sciences Alliance.
Dr Sinead Collins, School of Biological Sciences: “Predicting how populations of ocean algae will respond to changing ocean conditions is difficult, but these results suggest that populations from highly changeable environments are better placed to deal with additional environmental change than previously suspected.”

"“The art of losing isn’t hard to master.” Since the NSW bushfires, the opening line from Elizabeth Bishop’s great poem One Art feels remarkably apposite.  Bishop writes of loss and its acceptance, themes with a new and awful currency in the time of environmental collapse. For this is an era in which, to borrow her words, “so many things seem filled with the intent/to be lost”. We’ve just watched koalas, creatures already at risk from deforestation, incinerated in their hundreds (perhaps thousands). We lost millions of other animals at the same time, and the devastation of habitats will doom more in the months ahead, especially since ecosystems that never previously knew fire now burn for weeks. The Australian catastrophe mirrors events elsewhere. In the past 40 years, more than half the world’s wildlife has gone. Rainforests are disappearing at the astonishing rate of 30 football fields a minute. Some estimates place 75%  of coral reefs at risk from either local and global stress. As David Wallace-Wells says, most of the carbon we’ve burned has been consumed since the premiere of Seinfeld. In the remarkably brief time bookended between now and a show about nothing, we’ve set in train the destruction of wonders that we barely comprehend. Researchers recently proved that bees perform basic arithmetic, a gobsmacking discovery with profound implications about the nature of intelligence. Yet in Europe some 800 varieties of wild bee species appear on the critically endangered list, a subset of the 40% of all insect species said to be in decline. We know now that, like birds, reef fish sing a chorus to the sun each morning. We also know that, like birds, they’re dying – fish populations throughout the oceans are decreasing precipitously. Bishop describes personal calamities in a poem referencing her notoriously painful childhood. She barely knew her father; she was separated from her mentally ill mother at an early age. After inheriting a private income, she travelled widely, on journeys not always happy. “I lost two cities, lovely ones,” she writes, “… And, vaster, some realms I owned, two rivers, a continent.I miss them, but it wasn’t a disaster.” Today we cannot help but read those lines differently, with the devastation of cities, rivers and even continents an imminent prospect. Venice is flooding; the whole Murray-Darling basin is running dry; the Arctic (warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet) has been burning for months on end. Will we miss them? Will their destruction be a disaster? In the face of inevitable bereavement, Bishop writes of the acceptance – even the cultivation – of loss. “Lose something every day. Accept the fluster/of lost door keys, the hour badly spent.” In that way, she says, grief might become manageable. It’s a strategy that many of us adopt. “We are on track,” tweets the UN environment program, “for a temperature rise of over 3°C. This would bring mass extinctions & large parts of the planet would be uninhabitable.” Who can assimilate a warning like that? How do we go about our daily business knowing that unless something gives, much of the world will be ruined forever? Like Bishop, we adjust to small losses, one day at a time. We accept the strange absence of once common birds. We forget that, as children, we saw insects in great numbers and variety and now … we just don’t. We adjust our holidays to visit the forests that aren’t burned, the reefs that haven’t bleached. Like Bishop, we tell ourselves: “None of these will bring disaster.” Brecht, a more directly political writer, phrased the same thought somewhat differently in one of his anti-war poems. “When evil-doing comes like falling rain, nobody calls out ‘stop!’When crimes begin to pile up they become invisible.” Or, at least, they become invisible for a while. In the shattering conclusion of One Art, Bishop addresses directly the loss that haunts the poem: the absence of her lover. “Even losing you (the joking voice, a gestureI love) I shan’t have lied. It’s evidentthe art of losing’s not too hard to masterthough it may look like (Write it!) like disaster. In those lines the discipline of a very controlled poem collapses, precisely because, while some losses can be artfully mastered, others just cannot. The catastrophe unfolding around us falls into the second category. Whatever coping mechanism we adopt, no ironic distance will normalise the ruination of a planet: a disaster that cannot – must not! – be borne. • Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist"
"At a public seminar at a respected university in Scandinavia on how to promote cross-disciplinary research last year, the dean of one of the faculties passed the comment that “now we are living in the Anthropocene, everything we see around us, everything in our environment, we realise is the result of human activity”.  This, of course, is nonsense. The reach of human activity is demonstrably profound, affecting nearly all biogeochemical cycling within the Earth system, but to attribute all the changes we observe to human activity is wrong; humanity has no control over the output of solar radiation by the sun, the astronomical position of the Earth, or the internal processes that drive plate tectonics and volcanic activity. All three profoundly influence humans but operate entirely independently from human activity.  I could have chosen many other examples. The sad fact is that the adoption of the term Anthropocene – informal, as yet, but nevertheless clearly viral – is misleading. But it is worse than that; it has stimulated a redundant, manufactured, debate that displaces more important scientific research and genuine discussion on climate and environmental change. It is a fad, a bandwagon, a way of marketing research as cutting-edge and relevant. At its worst it can be seen as a disingenuous means of harvesting citations under the guise of serious endeavour. The term Anthropocene was first proposed back in 2000 by atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer, a biologist, to denote the recognition that humans are now profoundly altering the Earth’s climate system and environment. So profoundly, in fact, that Earth scientists should name a new epoch of geological time to register this impact.  The naming of chunks of geological time was necessary, particularly so before the dawn of radiometric dating and other ways of directly measuring the age of rocks. Back then, there was no choice. Names such as “Cambrian” and “Pleistocene” were invented and the time period they represented were defined in layers of rocks.  All this remains important. But it is always only a means to an end, a methodological step that ultimately helps Earth scientists to do what they should be doing; that is, to understand the fundamental processes and mechanisms that make the Earth what it is. Studying and naming layers of rock – stratigraphy – is not an end in itself, though reputations are made, and medals won, in deciding how the cake should be cut and what all the individual pieces should be called.  The term is now up for formal ratification by a subcommision of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) which requires the Anthropocene’s base – when it started – to be defined. So there is now a “debate” to decide where this base should be.  Is it the transition from hunting to farming, the moment Columbus arrived in America, the industrial revolution, or perhaps atomic weapons testing in 1960?  Without such a defined base, there can be no epoch. No doubt this debate will run and run and an Anthropocene Working Group is considering the matter and their latest contribution – a lengthy review that rehearses the various candidates for the base of the Anthropocene – has just been published in Science.  Quite apart from the difficulty of defining the base – the issue that so obsesses the anthropocenists – the term serves no useful purpose since it is not necessary for defining the rock record. There are plenty of ways of measuring time and establishing stratigraphies for the epoch when humans have progressively impacted the Earth system, such as measuring tree rings, radioisotopes introduced by atomic weapons testing, or counting annual layers in ice cores. We use these tools on a daily basis and have no need for the new term.   And while the anthropocenists rearrange the deck chairs, other scientists are getting on with the business of trying to understand, and do something, about the crisis we face."

He presents a fascinating statistic that tells us the alarmist claims being made today about higher and stronger storm frequency over the Atlantic are in fact a lot of hype and wild exaggeration.

The 30-year period from 1871 – 1900 saw 20 major hurricanes, i.e. 67% more than the 12 seen over the 1986 – 2015 period. Landfall points from 1871 – 1900 totaled 65, which is about 70% more than the recent 30-year period.

What more do you want?
Trump is right
Also Joe makes the very important point that in former times hurricane intensity was measured when they made landfall, and not while they were out to sea. Today modern instruments and satellites allow cyclones to be watched from birth to death, and very often these cyclones are stronger when they are over warm open waters. But as they approach land, they wind up intaking energy-sapping dry air form over the land and are weaker when they make landfall.
Also Bastardi confirms that Donald Trump was correct in his statement where he claimed hurricanes used to be stronger.
Bastardi does pour some cold water on hurricane frequency, claiming in his video that he doesn’t think hurricane variability is anything different than it was.

"When is an emergency really an emergency? If you’re the captain of the Titanic, approaching a giant iceberg with the potential to sink your ship becomes an emergency only when you realise you might not have enough time to steer a safe course.  And so it is, says Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, when it comes to the climate emergency. Knowing how long societies have to react to pull the brake on the Earth’s climate and then how long it will take for the ship to slow down is the difference between a climate emergency and a manageable problem. Rather than being something abstract and open to interpretation, Schellnhuber says the climate emergency is something with clear and calculable risks that you could put into a formula. And so he wrote one. Emergency = R × U = p × D × τ / T In a comment article in the journal Nature, Schellnhuber and colleagues explained that to understand the climate emergency we needed to quantify the relationship between risk (R) and urgency (U). Borrowing from the insurance industry, the scientists define risk (R) as the probability of something happening (p) multiplied by damage (D). For example, how likely is it that sea levels will rise by a metre and how much damage will that cause. Urgency (U) is the time it takes you to react to an issue (τ) “divided by the intervention time left to avoid a bad outcome (T)”, they wrote. Schellnhuber, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, tells Guardian Australia the work on the formula was just the “tip of a mathematical iceberg” in defining the climate emergency. “It can be illustrated by the Titanic disaster, but it applies to many severe risks where you can calculate the do-nothing/business-as-usual probability of a highly damaging event,” he says. “Yet there are options to avoid the disaster. “In other words, this a control problem.”  There is a time lag between the rapid cuts to greenhouse gases and the climate system reacting. Knowing if you have enough time tells you if you’re in an emergency or not. Schellnhuber used “standard risk analysis and control theory” to come up with the formula, and he was already putting numbers to it. “As a matter of fact, the intervention time left for limiting global warming to less than 2C is about 30 [years] at best. The reaction time – time needed for full global decarbonisation - is at least 20 [years].” As the scientists write in Nature, if the “reaction time is longer than the intervention time left” then “we have lost control”. Schellnhuber says: “Beyond that critical point, only some sort of adaptation option is left, such as moving the Titanic passengers into rescue boats (if available).” Earlier this month, Oxford Dictionaries announced “climate emergency” as the word of the year, defining it as “a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it”. One website tracking climate emergency declarations says 1,195 jurisdictions in 25 countries, representing 454 million people, have already voted on the emergency. This week the European parliament joined them, as did Ballina shire council in northern New South Wales, the 76th local government authority in Australia to make the declaration. Prof Will Steffen, of the Australian National University and the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and a co-author of the article, says: “Emergency can mean many things to many people. But there are some hard numbers behind why so many people are saying we are in a climate emergency. “This formula sharpens our thinking. So we have 30 years to decarbonise and to stabilise our pressure on the climate system.” In the Nature article, the scientists highlight nine “tipping points” that, if crossed, become almost impossible to stop. At least five are already “active”. Some of them, like melting permafrost or forest degradation, can start to add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, making the job of keeping global temperatures down even harder. “There are a range of these intervention times left,” Steffen says. “How long do we have before [the Greenland ice sheet] goes? Maybe we have 20 to 25 years and then we might be committed to losing Greenland. “But the time we have left to intervene to stabilise coral reefs, for example, is a lot less than 30 years. “Our reaction time has to be fast and to decarbonise by 2050 we have to really move now. That’s the point of [Schellnhuber’s] maths.  “To err on the side of danger is a stupid thing to do.”"

"Predators such as lions and leopards are becoming more populous in Namibia due to the success of recent conservation measures. But these wild animals are  causing increasing problems on livestock farms, as some of them prefer to eat beef steak for dinner rather than gamey venison. This, unsurprisingly, annoys ranchers, who can turn to their guns for a short-term solution. Conservationists have been trying to reduce this “human-wildlife conflict” for decades now. They’ve dabbled with livestock-guarding dogs to scare away predators, put up fences to keep livestock away from wild animals, given compensation to reimburse farmers for killed cows or sheep and even marketed “predator-friendly” beef that gives a price-premium to farmers that don’t kill carnivores.   But farmers in Namibia are still reporting increased conflict. Why is this? Previous research has looked into the environmental factors that affect the situation, such as the number of wild prey animals available for predators to eat or the types of habitats around the farms. But these studies often ignore the most critical part of all conservation issues: humans. I spent almost a year living on a livestock farm in Namibia in order to understand how political, economic, historical and social drivers might be influencing human-carnivore conflict. I visited many farms and interviewed the managers and their workers, and started to notice a trend: those farms that reported no issues with carnivores tended to be well-managed with happy, motivated workers. The historical backdrop of the country, particularly its era of apartheid, still looms over the farmlands like a foreboding shadow. The owners of these commercial farms were invariably white and, without exception, the workers were black. We started to ask farmers and their staff more about their working relationships and how they felt about working on farms. What we discovered was there were farms where the managers were both racist and violent towards their workers, which demotivated employees to perform well at their jobs. Racist managers also tended not to see the benefits of training their staff in more effective livestock husbandry, meaning employees were not skilled in protecting their cows and sheep from predators.  Many of the workers were also very poorly educated and some didn’t even know how to count properly. The farmer was asking the workers to go out and move a 250-herd of cattle from one field to another and check that none had been left behind, but you cannot expect them to do that if they can’t count to 100. This meant the livestock that were left behind were more likely to be eaten by predators. But what’s more, on these farms where workers were badly treated, staff sometimes resorted to revenge tactics for the violent treatment received from the farmers. Employees would poach oryx, zebra and other game animals either for food or to sell on for money, especially when they were not paid well. Reduced wild game numbers meant that carnivores were more likely to target livestock.  On top of this, workers sometimes stole livestock to sell on for profit and, to try to cover their tracks, told the farmer that a predator had come in the night and taken his calves. The farmer then thought he had a worse problem with predators than he really did. So how can we tackle the problem? Conservationists are not trained to deal with racism, human resources or to improve unequal societies. But our research has shown just how ingrained the conflict between carnivores and livestock farmers is: we cannot rely only on technical measures to fix this issue. Our work adds to a growing number of studies highlighting how problems of people-wildlife coexistence can be caused by conflict within humans. To figure out how to live peacefully with lions and leopards, we have to understand the deeper socio-cultural drivers that may underlie such conflicts and develop policies that resonate with the values and aspirations of farmers as well as conservationists.  We must start digging deeper into the human dimensions because, after all, if it weren’t for us humans, we wouldn’t need conservation. That’s why we need to work more with social scientists, historians and psychologists. If carnivores are to have a hope living on this planet, it’s up to us to save them. And to be successful at that, maybe we could imitate hungry hunting lions: collaboration is the key."
"Every time you flush your toilet or drain the bath, you’re losing something surprisingly valuable: heat.  It takes a lot of energy to warm up the water in the first place, and vast amounts of this energy simply disappear down the drain and is lost in the environment. Around 15-30% of a typical home energy bill goes on heating water. Reusing this “heat” would be a really simple way to make our lives more sustainable. Energy is everywhere in the urban water cycle. Water utilities use it to produce drinking water and pump it to your tap at home. After use, the water is discharged into the sewer and purified at the sewage treatment works. Those drainage and waste water treatments again use energy.  Water doesn’t have to be a huge drain on energy – it could even be a net energy factory. We’re already able to produce biogas from our waste, for instance, and use it to power the “poo bus” among other things.  It takes about ten times more energy to heat water than to pump it around or treat it after use. And that energy is usually wasted. After all, hot water from your tap is usually still warm when it goes down the drain and thus waste water contains lots of thermal energy.  Reusing this heat would be an easy win for the environment. It’d make the water cycle more energy efficient and greatly reduce our carbon footprint.  To recover the heat from our waste water we first need a heat exchanger. This device can run a cold water stream alongside a warmer one, without the two fluids mixing together. Instead, heat is extracted from the warm water and transferred to the cold water.  In a simple home system, cold water going to the shower head could be preheated with warmth from waste shower, kitchen and bath water, meaning we can use less warm water to create a comfortable shower. In larger systems, the heat exchanger can be installed in the sewer mains in the street. In this case, the cold stream will be a recirculating medium that brings the heat into a heat pump – a kind of refrigerator working in reverse. This heat pump can deliver the heat at a much higher temperature (around 50℃) to a third water stream. This hot stream can then be used in a building for space heating or again hot tapwater. It sounds great. So what’s stopping us?  First, it’s tough to figure out how effective heat recovery would be as it’s extremely hard to take flow and temperature measurements within a sewer. Devices rapidly get clogged up with solid waste and household litter. Available heat in the sewers also varies a great deal from day to day, or even hour to hour.  To overcome the difficulties of taking direct measurements we have used computer models that can predict how much heat is available in a sewer network. One model, Simdeum, looks at use of toilets, taps, washing machines and other appliances to estimate how much water will end up in the sewers – and how hot it will be. Another model, Sobek, will calculate how much water is flowing through the sewer network and the water levels in the sewer mains. We have developed an additional module that factors in how much heat is lost through pipe walls into the surrounding soil.  These models work in practice. When we investigated water use by students living on the University of Bath’s campus, we found our flow and temperature predictions based on surveys matched up closely with data from nearby manholes.  But we can only tap into this heat once we’ve figured out how to store it or feed it into a larger heating system. Strong daily variations in water usage and the lag between demand for hot water, which peaks at morning shower time, and its supply in the sewers means small-scale heat reuse remains impractical. All this is already possible on a larger scale, however. Model calculations in the Dutch city of Almere showed heat recovery from sewers becomes attractive once waste water is collected from 5,000 or more people. Practical evidence of systems in use can be found in Germany, Switzerland and Scandinavia. This article was written with Laura Piccinini as part of her Master project at EPFL Lausanne."

Share this...FacebookTwitterSo far we’ve been seeing lots of signs of a cold coming winter: birds migrating from Siberia to Britain weeks early, unusual early-autumn snowfalls across Europe, various reports warning of the worst winter in decades etc.
In August, weather analyst Gavin Partridge put up one of his weather videos here. In it he looks at past solar activity, the current Solar Cycle no. 24, and its strong similarity to Solar Cycle no. 12.

Our current Solar Cycle 24 is similar to Solar Cycle 12 (December 1878 to March 1890), Partridge says. Source of data: SIDC.
What’s fascinating is that there have been a number of studies showing how Great Britain’s winters seem to be highly impacted by solar activity. During weak cycles, Great Britain’s winters tend to be dominated by large blocking highs which steer cold air masses across the country for a larger part of the winter season and so result in colder and snowier winters.
The following chart shows Solar Cycle no. 12 (marked in yellow) compared to all the previous cycles.

Our current solar cycle 24 is shaping to be very similar to Solar Cycle 12 of the 1880s. So will Britain’s winters of Cycle No. 24 follow those of Cycle No. 12?  Partridge tells us in his video.
Partridge states that although Cycle 24 is not as weak as solar numbers 5 & 6, it is substantially weaker than normal and that it is strikingly similar to Cycle no. 12 of the 1870s and 1880s. The question is can we compare the winters of both cycles? Partridge does precisely that and comes up with stunning similarities between the winters of both cycles, depicted in the following chart.

The thin blue line shows the current cycle. The bold blue line depicts Cycle No. 24. The dark blue bars show the temperature anomaly of the Cycle 11/12 winters, while the light blue bars show the corresponding temperature anomaly for the Cycle 23/24 winters. Source: here.
Partridge’s chart above shows how the winter trends of both cycles correspond – almost stunningly.  Seven of eight winters were in agreement regarding whether the winter was colder or warmer than normal – or normal. Last winter (2014/15) was very close to normal, as was the 1884/84 winter.
For example at the end of Solar Cycle 11 and Solar Cycle 23 in 1877/78 and 2008/09 respectively, both saw colder than normal winters – as did the following 1878/79 (2009/10), 1879/80 (2010/11) and 1880/81 (2011/12) winters.
As both Solar Cycles no. 12 and 24 became active, the respective 4 subsequent winters were milder and averaged above normal. Last winter (2014/15 – which corresponds 1884/85) showed cooling and was close to average – same was the case for the 1884/85 winter.
Should our current solar cycle continue to follow the same course as Solar Cycle 12, then we may have an indicator for the upcoming 3 winters. Using the winters of solar Cycle 12, we see that the next three winters correspond to the winters of 1885/86, 1886/87, 1887/88 (marked yellow in the above chart). They were all colder than normal, which tells us that this coming 2015/16 winter and the 2 winters to follow are also likely to turn out to be colder than normal.
Here we are purely using the similarities solar cycle to previous cycles indicate what the future might hold. Naturally there are many other factors at play. For example did the 1885/86 winter see a strong El Nino and a cold North Atlantic like we are seeing this year?
Of course using only solar cycle similarities is a dubious way to make a seasonal forecast. But on the other hand when 7 out of 8 years correspond to each other, it’s certainly something to keep in the back of your mind. So far the coming UK winter is shaping up to be right on course with Cycle no. 12. We’ll know in a few months time.

"As they released their eighth album, Everyday Life, Coldplay announced last week that they would not be taking it on tour, instead performing the album just once on British soil at the Natural History Museum. Frontman Chris Martin expressed his concerns about the future of touring, highlighting the difficulties of reconciling flying with environmentalism and expressed a wish to see a Coldplay show run largely on solar power with no single-use plastic. Snark was instant – “Coldplay announces plan to spare planet the effects of future Coldplay concerts” ran one headline – but others lauded the move: the band’s previous tour featured 122 shows across five continents and generated £405m. Massive Attack also declared this week that “business as usual is over’’ as they begin working with the University of Manchester’s Tyndall Centre to map the carbon footprint of tours and work on a blueprint to reform the industry, a message similarly shared by Billy Bragg on his recent tour.  Bragg tells me: “I looked at what I do and thought, how can I do this in a way that is more conducive to a greener way of touring?” As well as raising the issue at his shows he now limits his flights through a new touring model: Bragg is the only member of his crew to fly to the US, where he then drives from venue to venue with a small team, settling in each city for a number of shows. Chiara Badiali, from UK based music and sustainability charity Julie’s Bicycle, says “reimagining touring is probably the music industry’s biggest challenge – it will have to change”, while Lewis Jamieson, a founder member of UK climate action group Music Declares Emergency, backed Coldplay’s action. “If they can create a template for touring that is more sustainable,” says Jamieson, “they are in a position where they can drive that research more than smaller acts – something that will benefit all artists.” But gigging is more important than ever to artists in the age of streaming and rapidly declining CD sales – and especially for those who are not industry juggernauts. It was reported last week that the value of the British live music industry reached a record high of £1.1bn in 2018. Is radical change possible? Writing in the Guardian, Massive Attack’s Robert Del Naja admitted that bands won’t completely stop touring. Fay Milton, co-founder of Music Declares Emergency and member of British post-punk group Savages, agrees: “Music, playing music and sharing culture is a beautiful and amazing thing and we shouldn’t stop that altogether.” This was reiterated by Jamieson, who declared the end of live music “neither feasible nor desirable”. Bragg says: “There’s something that you can get at a gig that you can’t get online. It’s a form of communion. That feeling of not being alone, there’s not many places you can get that any more.” Milton acknowledges she contrived explanations while touring. “I was really aware that we were heading towards climate catastrophe but I made excuses because it was art and I saw it as different,” she says. “But no one really gets special dispensation. This is something we all need to do.” Milton says she doesn’t know if she’ll enjoy touring any more, without feeling the weight of it. Coldplay and Massive Attack are not the only acts to address these matters. In 2010, Drake billed his Away from Home tour as half tour, half environmental campaign, working with not-for-profit organisation Reverb to minimise the tour’s environmental impact. Reverb has since grown, working with Pink, Fleetwood Mac, Harry Styles and Maroon 5 in the last year alone, and Billie Eilish’s tour in 2020 will also be in partnership with the company. Eilish expressed her support for climate activism in a video entitled Our House Is on Fire and earlier this week wore a “No Music on a Dead Planet” T-shirt at the American Music awards – the same slogan touted by Foals at this year’s Mercury prize ceremony. Much of the efforts of Reverb and its affliated artists’ focus on actions such as limiting the use of plastic straws, providing water for reusable bottles and educational hubs around the venue – actions that align closely with Music Declares Emergency’s plan. However, far more work is needed to tackle the larger contributing factors relating to climate change and the entertainment industry. The Green Touring Network report that 34% of a tour’s carbon footprint comes from the venue itself, followed closely by audience travel (33%), with the third biggest factor being merchandise at 12%. The 1975 have addressed the merch question in an easy but somewhat radical step: “upcycling” unsold previous merchandise by applying new graphics. As well as focusing on recycling and waste reduction backstage, Mumford and Sons reported – somewhat vaguely – that they worked to reduce the carbon footprint of their recent tour. KT Tunstall took the more direct approach of planting thousands of trees, a move similarly adopted by Coldplay in 2002. But carbon offsetting was criticised by Del Naja, who said it “creates an illusion that high-carbon activities enjoyed by wealthier individuals can continue, by transferring the burden of action and sacrifice to others”. Tours will need to not generate CO2 in the first place, and there will need to be pressure from artists and promoters on venues to switch to sustainable energy sources – or face losing their business. There are more radical solutions besides, particularly regarding audience travel. Milton argues that live music “doesn’t have to be commercial or something you do on stage, it can be a lot more participatory as well. There’s a lot of interesting technology there.” MelodyVR allows fans not attending a gig to watch it via a virtual reality headset and app. “Instead of a 50-day tour, some artists prefer to do five and share it via VR,” says Anthony Matchett, MelodyVR’s CEO and founder. Another potential solution could be livestreaming performances to cinemas, as Kanye West did for the recent launch of his album Jesus Is King. Bragg resists ideas like this though, complaining that “so many people experience culture through a screen in isolation”. The passion for live music is unlikely to abate, then, for artists or audiences. The key challenge, as Jamieson says, is “to find ways of doing things better first, rather than assuming that the only way is to stop doing them”."

"Two plants of the same species grow side by side. One is attacked by insects, one not. On an individual plant, some leaves get eaten, some not. This doesn’t happen at random, but is caused by the fungi that live within the leaves and roots of the plant. Imagine you are holding a shoot of the dahlia plant, pictured below. How many species do you have in your hand? The answer is most certainly not one, but probably somewhere between 20 and 30. This is because every plant has fungi and bacteria that live on its surface (called epiphytes) and within its tissues (called endophytes).   If the stem is still attached to its roots then the number of species would easily double. The roots contain lots of endophytes and a separate group of fungi, called mycorrhizas. These fungi grow into plant roots and form a symbiotic relationship in which the fungus donates nutrients (principally phosphate and nitrate) to the plant, in return for a supply of carbon. There has been a recent surge of interest in these fungi, as their presence can affect the growth of insects that attack plants. Research at Royal Holloway has shown that mycorrhizal fungi reduce the growth of many insects, by increasing the plant’s chemical defences. Our most recent work shows that endophyte fungi, the ones that live within plant tissue, can also cause plants to produce novel chemicals. So both endophytes and mycorrhizas can be thought of as plant bodyguards, where both partners benefit from the association. The fungi gain refuge and resources, while the plant gains a natural pest protection system. The challenge is to exploit this natural system in agriculture and horticulture. However, these sorts of fungi are rare in crop plants thanks to years of fungicides, fertilisers and plant breeding, and modern crops have far fewer natural fungal partners than their counterparts in the wild. In a wildflower meadow, many plants grow in close proximity but these plants can have entirely different fungal bodyguards. Although the plants grow in the same conditions, with the same spores floating around, they appear to select which fungi colonise their tissues.  Perhaps more intriguing is that different fungi exert different effects on insects, a phenomenon called “ecological specificity”. In nature, plants seem to select the fungi that will provide them with maximum benefit. If we’re to use this in agriculture, the challenge is to find the “right” combinations of fungi that will provide crops with protection against pests and diseases. There is a separate group of fungi, called entomopathogens, that kill insects. These fungi can also live within plant tissues, meaning that if an insect eats an infected leaf, it ingests a killer fungus. There is evidence that plants particularly allow these most beneficial of bodyguards to colonise their tissues extensively – more so than other tissue-dwelling fungi. The chemicals produced by all of these fungi travel throughout the plant. Some fungi in the root can change the host plant’s chemistry to keep leaf-feeding insects largely at bay, which may well be one reason why cultivating a rich soil full of useful microbes can lead to reduced pest problems above ground. Other mycorrhiza (root) fungi can change the chemical makeup of a plant’s leaves, and we have found that these chemicals can attract parasitoid insects to give another level of defence – they can reduce insect growth by making leaves less edible, while simultaneously helping the plant to call parasitic insects that attack the herbivores. Perhaps even more exciting is the discovery that networks of fungi in the soil can link many plants together. The mushrooms you see above ground are simply the fruiting bodies of a larger organism below the surface, composed of thread-like material called mycelium.  Each mycelial thread (a hypha) has a structure like a drain pipe. When plants are attacked by insects, they produce alarm chemicals that are transported to neighbouring plants through this pipe network. Unattacked plants respond to these alarm signals by producing chemicals to ward off an impending attack.  This may be why “no-dig” gardening is thought by many to produce healthier crops than commercial agriculture, where this “fungal network” is continuously disrupted by ploughing. Plants and fungi do not exist in isolation, but instead form a cooperative in the war against insect pests. Even better is that the fungi are perfectly edible – if you had a salad recently, you’ll have plenty of endophytes within your stomach right now."
