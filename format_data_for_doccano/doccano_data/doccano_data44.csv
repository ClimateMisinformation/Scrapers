"Tucked away in volume three of the technical data for Britain’s £53bn high speed rail project is a table that shows 20m tonnes of concrete will have to be poured to build the requisite 105 miles of track, culverts, bridges and tunnels. It is enough, it has been calculated, to pave over the entire city of Manchester. A more modest 3 million tonnes of concrete will be needed to construct the Hinckley B nuclear power station in Somerset, and the proposed new runway at Heathrow will require one million tonnes.  Cement, the key component of concrete and one of the most widely used manmade materials, is now the cornerstone of global construction. It has shaped the modern environment, but its production has a massive footprint that neither the industry nor governments have been willing to address. This week Guardian Cities investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the planet, to learn what we can do to bring about a less grey world. Our species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers. Concrete causes up to 8% of global CO2 emissions; if it were a country it would be the world's worst culprit after the US and China. It fills our rubbish dumps, overheats our cities, causes floods that kills thousands of people – and fundamentally changes our relationship to the planet. Can we kick our addiction, when it's so hard to imagine modern life without it? In this series of articles, Concrete Week will explore the impact of the material on our environment and us, and look at alternative options for the future. Chris Michael, Cities editor Because of the heat needed to decompose rock and the natural chemical processes involved in making cement, every tonne made releases one tonne of C02, the main greenhouse warming gas. Including the new Crossrail line through London, the building of Britain’s four largest current construction projects will, if completed, together emit more than 10m tonnes of CO2 – roughly the same amount as a city the size of Birmingham, or what 19 million Malawians emit in a year. Nearly 6% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions, and up to 8% of the world’s, are now sourced from cement production. If it were a country, the cement industry would be the third largest in the world, its emissions behind only China and the US. So great is its carbon footprint that unless it is transformed and made to adopt cleaner practices, the industry could, on its own, jeopardise the whole 2015 Paris agreement which aims to hold worldwide temperatures to a 2C increase. To bring it into line, the UN says its annual emissions need to fall about 16% in the next 10 years, and by far more in the future. While some of the biggest cement companies have reduced the carbon intensity of their products by investing in more fuel-efficient kilns, most improvements gained have been overshadowed by the massive increase in global cement and concrete production. Population increases, the urban explosion in Asia and Africa, the need to build dams, roads and houses, as well as increases in personal wealth have stoked demand. Annual cement production has quadrupled from nearly one billion to over 4 billion tonnes a year in 30 years. In the next decade it is expected to increase a further 500m tonnes a year. Unless there is a dramatic change, cement emissions are expected to continue to rise beyond 2050. Industry leaders are now embarrassed, aware that they are in danger of being financially penalised and tarred as climate laggards who refuse to change in the face of the climate emergency. They well know that not only is it quite possible to build most structures safely without cement, but their own research has shown that green, cement-like products using recycled byproducts which are just as strong can be made from other industries, such as steel slag, fly ash from coal-fired facilities or some types of clay. Instead they trust that nascent technologies like carbon capture and storage which could allow emissions to be buried will come on stream, and that more efficient plant will reduce cement emissions by as much as 20-25%. This is wishful-thinking. The great bulk of the industry is inherently conservative, ignorant of the alternatives to cement and reluctant to adopt change. Conventional, or Portland, cement is trusted to be safe and strong and developers continue to specify it because it is cheap and the alternatives are not well-known. Without major demonstration projects showing what is possible, and the education of architects and planners, progress will be incremental and possibly too late. But technological change will not alone drive cement emissions down fast enough. What is needed to speed up cuts is a global cement, or concrete tax. Only if the whole industry is forced to pay far more for the emissions of its product will companies shift to cleaner practices. A specific cement tax would fit well into the growing clamour for a simple revenue-neutral global carbon tax. These have been proposed and adopted on a limited basis for over 20 years, but the cement industry has strongly lobbied against them in Europe, the US, Canada and elsewhere. Indeed, such is the industry’s influence that governments have not only been shy to adopt anything more than token restrictions, but have been encouraged to promote giant concrete-intensive projects like HS2 and massive road building programmes. In Europe, where an emissions trading scheme has repeatedly stuttered, carbon regulation on cement makers has perversely resulted in windfall profits for the industry and no emission cuts. There are now at least 70 national and regional carbon tax schemes covering possibly 20% of all global emissions. Some, like those imposed in Norway, Sweden and Finland, are straight taxes; others, including California, the EU, China and South Korea, are emission-trading schemes which issue permits for industries to pollute. The consensus is that the carbon in all these schemes is still priced way too low to drive change and to encourage fuel-intensive industries like cement to change practices. At best, the carbon schemes have encouraged cement makers and other big emitters to relocate to avoid charges. Studies suggest that direct taxes not only cut emissions better than “cap and trade” schemes, but also raise more money. A high global cement tax, the theory goes, would concentrate industry’s minds and massively reduce demand for carbon-intensive cement, but any tax that raise energy prices would be very unpopular. The solution, say some economists, is to make a cement or carbon tax “revenue neutral”, with money raised from industry returned to people in the form of tax rebates to offset any rise in energy bills, or used to specifically reduce other emissions. Where similar approaches have been used, as in Switzerland which has a tax on heating fuel, or New Zealand, high carbon taxes have proved both popular and effective. The cement industry has transformed the world and enriched both itself and mankind. But it now threatens to tip the environment into uncontrolled warming. It’s now payback time and the industry must respond urgently to the problem it has helped to create. Guardian Concrete Week investigates the shocking impact of concrete on the modern world.

"Angus Taylor has insisted it would be “apocalyptic” for the economy if Labor did not use Kyoto carryover credits towards its emissions reduction targets, while still maintaining they were “relatively small in terms of the overall carbon budget”. Following on from his Sunday interview in which he falsely claimed emissions had gone down, though the government’s own data showed a 0.9% increase, the energy minister accused critics of “cherry-picking” time periods to prove their points, when his own assertions relied on just the last quarter, instead of the whole year.  And in a rare interview Melissa Price agreed with Taylor’s false assertions, telling reporters: “If you have a look on the data over the last quarter, they have gone down.” Reminded that over the last year they had gone up, the environment minister said that wasn’t where her attention was directed. “I am focused on the good news,” she said. Labor is yet to say whether the Kyoto carryover credits of a 367-megatonne abatement would be used in its 45% reduction target. The government has included them in its own smaller target of 26%. Countries which exceeded their Kyoto target are allowed to use that excess towards the later Paris commitment, meaning that past carbon reductions can be counted towards future targets. Speaking to Sky News, the “minister for lowering electricity prices” said it would be irresponsible for Labor not to use the carryover credits. “[Labor’s 45% target] will be economy-wrecking if they do use the carryover,” Taylor said. “It will apocalyptic if they don’t use it. “This is the real question, it remains unanswered, and we remain very proud of Australia’s track record in getting to the Kyoto obligations, whether it is 2010 obligations or 2020, and our progress on Paris for 2030. “I would also say to this, that we have the lowest levels of emissions per capita now for 29 years, and you know, everyone likes, there are lots who like to talk down Australia’s performance in this area – it is very strong. And that is a time when we have had in recent years a very, very strong economy, strong LNG exports and you know, it is an astounding achievement.” At the same time Taylor insisted the carryover credits were “relatively small” in terms of the overall carbon budget. “But it makes a very big difference if Labor chooses not to use it,” he said. Asked how not using the carryover credits could be “apocalyptic” yet at the same time form a small part of the Coalition’s plan, Taylor said it was possible for them to be both. “Because if you look at the independent modelling of Labor getting to 45% using the carryover, you get a cut of wages of $9,000 a year, you get 336,000 jobs loss, so that is devastating. It is a wrecking ball for the economy, but you get to a point where getting any more just becomes apocalyptic. It is too hard.” The Greens MP, Adam Bandt, said it was unclear to him how Labor would meet its 45% emissions reduction target by 2030 without using the carryover credits. “Given Labor has abandoned a carbon price and is now coming up with a sector-by-sector approach to emissions reduction, it is not at all clear how they’ll meet even their low 45% on 2005 target without relying on the dodgy carryover credits,” he said. “They’ve locked in a pro-rata 45% cut in electricity. Not only is this less than business as usual, but it puts the burden on other sectors.” The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, on Monday described the use of carryover credits to meet targets as “technically possible” while criticising the government’s record on emissions reduction. He did not rule out Labor also using the on-paper measure. “This government is relying on a technical loophole to do the heavy lifting because they don’t have other climate change policies,” he said. “What they are doing may be technically possible to do but practically it shouldn’t be used as an excuse for real action on climate change.” Australia’s emissions have continued to rise, carrying on a trend established in 2013 when Abbott government abolished the Gillard government’s price on carbon. Taylor would not say whether it was “more accurate” to admit that total emissions had increased over the last five years, though they were down in the last quarter. “I’ll tell you what is more accurate, is to stop cherry picking time periods for a gotcha question,” he said, adding: “The real question is are we going to reach our international obligations. That is what counts.”"
"MPs debated climate change in the Commons chamber last week for the first time in two years. It was our first opportunity since September 2016 to talk about the biggest and most urgent crisis humanity has ever faced. Just 40 MPs showed up. This absenteeism speaks volumes. Even as we’ve sweated through a record-breaking February, as wildfires tear through our ancient woodlands, as insect and wildlife populations collapse around us, the words “climate change” are scarcely whispered in the corridors of Whitehall. Since 2010, this government has built a bonfire out of the measures designed to cut emissions. Zero carbon homes targets have been scrapped. Onshore wind has been effectively banned. Solar power has been shafted. The Green Investment Bank has been flogged off. Fracking has been forced on communities who have rejected it. Ministers champion the drop in our domestic carbon dioxide emissions – but they neglect to mention the true scale of our impact. Between 1997 and 2015, our total carbon footprint – taking into account everything we import and consume, as well as what we produce – declined by a pitiful 3.8%. On the opposition benches, while many MPs grasp the severity of this situation, their parties’ policies are littered with impossible inconsistencies. We cannot tackle climate change and build new runways, or prop up North Sea oil and gas, or spend billions on new roads. And we cannot tackle climate change with an economy built on the assumption that precious minerals, fresh air, clean water and rare species can magically regenerate themselves in an instant – that somehow the Earth will expand to meet our voracious appetite for new stuff. The world’s top scientists say we need to cut emissions to net zero by the middle of the century. But during that same period, the global economy is set to nearly triple in size. It would be hard enough to decarbonise existing levels of production and consumption in just a few decades. To do it three times over is nigh on impossible. To pursue never-ending economic growth – or even to keep things ticking along as they are – is to gamble with the fate of humanity. We need nothing short of a transformation of the way we live our lives – and the way we measure progress. In the US, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has reinvigorated the idea of a Green New Deal – an initiative I was proud to have co-founded 10 years ago here in the UK. It takes its inspiration from Roosevelt’s New Deal of the 1930s, which used massive investment in jobs and infrastructure to pull the US out of the Great Depression. In 2019, we face an even bigger challenge. To avoid climate catastrophe, we must go beyond what is considered politically possible. A Green New Deal would mobilise resources on a scale unprecedented in peacetime, to tackle the climate emergency and address spiralling inequality. It would involve huge investment in clean energy, warm homes and affordable public transport – delivering a decent, well-paid job to everyone who wants one. It would rebuild once proud communities that have been hollowed out by deindustrialisation and austerity, allowing them to thrive as part of a collective endeavour to protect the planet. And it would protect and restore threatened habitats and carbon sinks like forests, wild places, soils and oceans. To do this, we must be able to leverage whatever finance is necessary to tackle the crisis. This is not a Trumpian border wall emergency – this is a real emergency. Critics might denounce such a plan as fantasy politics – but I ask them, with just 11 years left to halve global climate emissions, what is your alternative? Young people understand what’s needed to secure their futures. Last month, they went on school strike across the country to protest about government inaction on climate change. In our cities and towns, Green councillors have persuaded more than 25 local authorities to declare a climate emergency – and now schools and universities are doing the same. These are some of the most inspirational and hopeful acts I’ve seen in years. And where the people lead, politicians must follow. Parliament must now declare a climate emergency. It must debate climate change regularly. It must develop the laws necessary to implement a Green New Deal and climate-proof every piece of legislation. And the government must ensure climate change is a priority in all departmental and cabinet decision-making. But government and parliament will only act if we tell them to. So talk about climate breakdown – to your friends, your family, your neighbours and your colleagues. Join the school strikes. Join peaceful direct action initiatives like Extinction Rebellion. Write to your MP. Write to your councillors. Write to your banks. This is an emergency. Let’s treat it like one. • Caroline Lucas is the MP for Brighton Pavilion"
"Australia has endured its hottest summer ever, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, breaking the previous record set six years ago. The 2018-19 summer, which produced near 50C days and topped temperature highs across the country, has officially exceeded the previous record set in 2012-13, which was 1.28C above what is considered normal. Climate analysts say it falls into a pattern of human-induced global warming.  January alone had already been confirmed as the hottest month ever recorded in Australia, with a mean temperature across the nation of 30.8C, which was 2.9C above the average for January temperatures (calculated between 1961–1990) of 27.9C. On Thursday, the BoM revealed the whole season was officially the hottest ever recorded. While exact figures are not yet confirmed, the bureau said this summer’s mean temperature was at least 2C above the 27.5C benchmark of what is considered normal, based on 1961-1990. “Summer has been our warmest summer on record in terms of maximum temperatures, in terms of minimum temperatures and in terms of mean temperatures,” said Andrew Watkins, the BoM’s manager of long-range forecasting. The statistics will come as no surprise to Australians who sweltered through back-to-back heatwaves and battled bushfires across the country. In January alone, Adelaide broke its all-time heat record with a 46.6C day, Port Augusta broke its record with 48.9C, and then broke it again with 49.5C a week later. The small New South Wales town of Noona also broke the record for the highest overnight minimum ever recorded, with a night that never dropped below 39.5C. And in Cloncurry in Queensland, residents endured 43 days in a row over 40C, Watkins said. This summer’s extreme temperatures had been predicted since late last year, with the BoM’s climate outlook forecasting a drier, hotter summer due to the El Niño weather event, a positive Indian Ocean Dipole and the effect of global warming. The “long-term increasing trend in global air and ocean temperatures” was a factor in the hotter-than-average summer, the report said in October. On Thursday, the BoM also updated its outlook for the coming autumn, saying there were “very high odds” that hot, dry conditions would continue. Watkins warned that while some high rainfall events could occur, it would largely be bad news for drought-stricken farmers. “I wish we had better news than that,” he said. Also on Thursday, Victorian health authorities warned of a late summer heatwave that would bring 40C temperatures on Saturday. The bureau has forecast a heatwave across most of Victoria over the weekend, and Victoria’s chief health officer issued a health alert for parts of the state from Thursday to Saturday. Pregnant women, the elderly, children and people with medical conditions have been warned to take care. Victoria’s emergency management commissioner, Andrew Crisp, also warned there was a high fire risk, peaking at a severe fire danger rating in parts on Saturday."
"A lot of officious adults have been saying that there’s little point in school pupils striking in protest at the lack of action on climate change, as it will have no economic effect. They have a point, and so I would like to put forward a suggestion that may work better. Schoolchildren have no voice at the ballot box or wealth-creating labour to withdraw, but the pounds in their pockets weigh as heavily in the till as anybody else’s. We are at the beginning of Lent, when Christians traditionally deny themselves the good things in life in order to achieve a higher goal: why don’t our children hold a consumer-spending strike for this period? Buy – or have others buy for you – only life’s essentials: no sweets, makeup, computer games, sparkly unicorn poo slime, cinema tickets; buy clothes and books only if compulsory for school; if you usually buy a pasty or a sandwich at lunchtime, sign up for school dinners instead (I know, I know, but it will be a conspicuous sacrifice…).  Combine the financial strike with a conventional one, with lots of banners letting us supposedly responsible grownups know what you are doing and why, and see if the dent you can put in the economy will wipe the smiles off our faces.Rachel Savage (age 51)Sturton by Stow, Lincolnshire • Mark O’Connell, reviewing David Wallace-Wells’ The Uninhabitable Earth (Review, 2 March), underlines our political complacency alongside our denial of the effects of climate change. If the Guardian ran a daily column on one side of the front page citing headlines of new evidence, there would be no avoiding the topic. For example, Wallace-Wells asserts: “We are now burning 80% more coal than we were just in 2000.” Some evidence could be edited out daily as new evidence became available.Hannah MorrowHaslingfield, Cambridgeshire • The Guardian letters page is marking International Women’s Day by publishing only letters from women – see them all at gu.com/letters and at the following links: Women worldwide must be heard and respected Equality for African women Rape victims can’t trust the justice system Does taking Friday afternoon off school do children any harm?

"Over thousands of years, like humans everywhere, we became used to thinking of the sun, rain and wind as the backdrop to our lives – external entities over which we had no dominion. In the 21st century, this has become a delusion. The unpredictability of weather in the UK, particularly during summers that many wish were drier and sunnier, is associated by many people with what it means to be British. It has big variations – temperatures in the north of Scotland can be up to 20C lower than in southern England – and is characteristically unsettled due to the jet stream.  Its unreliability may have aided those wishing to avoid the truth about global warming. But the evidence of our senses, as well as what meteorologists and other scientists tell us, is becoming overwhelming. While many people are enjoying this week’s record-breaking temperatures – 20.3C in Wales on Monday, and 21.2C in London on Tuesday, the hottest winter days on record – many of the same people are also worried. Extreme or unusual weather in the UK is becoming widely recognised as an indication that the climate is changing, though this realisation has been a long time coming.  That is understandable. Connections between one-off weather events and longer-term patterns must be drawn with caution. Greenhouse gas emissions do not explain everything. But over the past few years, the science of weather attribution has made dramatic advances. Using computer models combined with observational data, meteorologists can now analyse extreme events including floods, droughts and heatwaves to determine the contribution of manmade climate change. Last summer’s UK heatwave, when average temperatures in June, July and August were 2C above pre-industrial levels, was made 30 times more likely by greenhouse gases. Simply facing this reality as a nation would be a big step forward. For too long, and in defiance of evidence, climate deniers such as former chancellor Lord Lawson were offered prominent platforms to air their views without challenge. Partly as a consequence of such mixed messages, public opinion lags behind scientific knowledge. Recent survey data shows that while 93% of British people know climate change is happening, only 36% believe that humans are mainly responsible, while just 25% describe themselves as very worried. It is too soon to say whether this month’s unseasonal warmth, following last year’s extremes of cold and hot, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s warning that we have just 12 years in which to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C will shift minds further in the right direction. International cooperation remains the key to averting a global catastrophe. Next year’s US presidential election will be a crucial moment, with President Trump committed to withdrawing the world’s second-biggest carbon emitter from the Paris climate change agreement. But the UK too has a vital role to play, either within or outside the EU. As our heating planet turns from a threat into an emergency, with emissions still increasing, we must reject passivity in favour of action. Climate change won’t affect the UK as severely as it will poorer countries, or those more vulnerable to desertification or flooding. Our target of 80% reductions in greenhouse gases by 2050 is already more ambitious than many comparable countries. But the government should be far more active in advancing public understanding. It is no longer permissible to pretend that ice-creams in February are a quirk of nature."

"The energy minister has again insisted Australia’s emissions are going down, when the government’s official figures show emissions continue to increase, as the government struggles to sell the latest incarnation of its energy policy. In an interview with the ABC program Insiders, Angus Taylor repeatedly stated emissions had decreased by 1% repeating the line first said by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, that Australia would meet its Paris commitments in “a canter”.  “Yes, they’re coming down and the department rightly believes they’re going to continue to go down and the result of this is we will reach, not just our Kyoto targets and still in the Kyoto period, we will reach our Paris targets,” he said. The latest report released by the environment department, looking at emissions between September 2017 and September 2018, showed total emissions in Australia had increased by 0.9%, continuing a pattern of increases over the past five years. The latest greenhouse gas emissions data is out, and YES, another record (and a new graph) pic.twitter.com/LY8JGfvdd0 That rise in emissions was largely due to an increase in liquid natural gas exports, but other sectors, including stationary energy, transport and waste sectors also contributed. Emissions in the electricity sector did continue to decrease, with brown coal supply down by 12.3% while energy generation from renewable sources increased by 14.2% The last substantial fall in Australian emissions occurred after the Gillard government put a price on carbon, which was immediately derided as a “carbon tax” by the Abbott opposition, a claim Tony Abbott’s chief advisor, Peta Credlin later admitted was not true and was just “brutal retail politics” which won Abbott the election. Since then, the Coalition has struggled to settle on an energy policy, with its most serious attempt, the national energy guarantee, leading to the demise of Malcolm Turnbull’s prime ministership. Under pressure from moderates and the electoral reality the Coalition needs to hold on to its inner city ‘small l Liberal’ seats if it is to have a chance at retaining power, Morrison unveiled a new energy policy late last month, announcing what amounts to a reboot of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action policy. The emissions reduction fund only amounts to $200m a year. With the election less than three months away, the government has officially signed off on the expansion of the Snowy hydro-project, which began under Turnbull’s leadership, and committed at least $56m to the construction of the Marinus link, the so-called “battery of the nation” project, which would send Tasmania’s renewable power to the mainland. However a feasibility study into the success of the Tasmanian interconnector project made it clear that its benefits would be realised “when approximately 7,000MW of the national electricity market’s present coal-fired generation capacity retires”, which would mean accelerating the removal of coal from the system. “The largest single influencing factor in the economic feasibility and timing of Marinus Link is the trajectory of coal-fired generation retirement in the national electricity market,” the feasibility report concluded. The government has not ruled out underwriting coal-fired generation projects in the future, with resources minister Matt Canavan admitting last week to Sky News the number was “around 10”, after Taylor repeatedly declined to put a figure on it. But to underwrite coal-generation projects, while supporting the Tasmanian ‘battery of the nation’ project, the success of which relies on the removal of coal from the system, would establish a situation where the government was competing with itself, potentially making one project un-viable. In his Sunday interview, Taylor still declined to put a figure on how many coal projects the government was considering underwriting, stating “I’m the energy minister, I am not going to commit to a number here and now”, but he said more competition was good, despite the contradiction in projects. “You put your finger on it – we want more competition,” he said. “We want more competition, not less. And if what we’re doing with Snowy 2.0 and what we’re doing with battery of the nation and what we’re doing with underwriting results in more competition against ourselves, as you put it, that is a great thing because the result of that is lower prices, keeping the lights on and avoiding the situation we had in Victoria in January – 200,000 houses lost their lights. “Portland Aluminium smelter had to go off-line. If the battery of the nation had been up and running when that happened, it wouldn’t have happened. “We got to address this. It is urgent. That’s why we’re doing it a number of ways. It will result in more supply, it will result in more competition as you rightly point out and that will drive down prices.”"
"This one has to succeed. It is not just that the youth climate strike, now building worldwide with tremendous speed, is our best (and possibly our last) hope of avoiding catastrophe. It is also that the impacts on the young people themselves, if their mobilisation and hopes collapse so early in their lives, could be devastating. To help this movement win, we should ask why others lost. We should ask, for instance, why Occupy, despite the energy and sacrifices of so many, came to an end, while the institutions it confronted remain intact. We should wonder why the global justice movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, despite the numbers involved, their courage and determination, has not changed the world. We should consider why Podemos, the Spanish party that rose so high on the optimism of the indignados movement, now seems to be spiralling into recriminatory collapse. Much of what I propose here is controversial, and I can't promise I've got it right Those of us who witnessed these disappointments have, I feel, a painful duty to be as honest about them as possible, to help ensure their failures are not repeated. Much of what I propose here is controversial, and I can’t promise I’ve got it right. So my first advice is this: don’t listen only to me. A central task for any campaign is to develop a narrative: a short, simple story explaining where we are, how we got here and where we need to go. Using the narrative structure common to almost all successful political and religious transformations, the restoration story, it might go something like this. “The world has been thrown into climate chaos, caused by fossil fuel companies, the billionaires who profit from them and the politicians they have bought. But we, the young heroes, will confront these oligarchs, using our moral authority to create a movement so big and politically dangerous that our governments are forced to shut down the fossil economy and restore the benign conditions in which humans and other species can thrive.” This restoration narrative, I think, could be greatly strengthened by recent findings suggesting that ecological recovery – restoring forests, salt marshes, peat bogs, the seabed and other crucial ecosystems – could, by drawing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, make a massive contribution towards preventing climate breakdown. (I’ll write about that when I finish my research on the subject, in a few weeks). A successful movement should also define a clear and tangible objective, perhaps a date by which nations achieve a zero-carbon economy. It could recommend a pathway, such as a ramped-up version of the green new deal proposed by the most progressive Democrats. If so, it will need to set a series of waymarks, by which it can judge whether or not governments are on track. This ensures that the activists, rather than the government, keep setting the agenda. This objective should be supported by a set of irreducible principles that can be explained and spread with pride and conviction. Here are a couple of possible examples. “Human life is not negotiable, it cannot be exchanged for money.” “Those generations that are yet to be born have the same rights as those already alive.” Clear principles appear to be essential to the long-running success of a campaign. A fascinating report in the online magazine Truthout explains how indigenous people living around Lake Texcoco in Mexico confronted a $13bn international airport – one of the biggest infrastructure projects in Latin America – and, across 17 years, and despite all predictions, won. The campaign was built on the principle that their land and community were not for sale, however much money might be offered. This ensured that the Mexican government’s only remaining strategy was force. But the people had created such strong community organisations and attracted so much support from other Mexicans that force ceased to be an option. This suggests another crucial element: a protest community strong enough to resist all attempts at division and co-option. Such communities do not arise by accident but are consciously and carefully constructed, often with the help of training, music and fun. They must be strong enough to support people threatened by despair, burnout or breakdown, especially when the response gets nasty. Already, conspiracy theories are being spread by politicians and the media, suggesting that the young people have been organised by unknown sinister forces: after all, how could children possibly organise themselves? Greta Thunberg, whose school strike sparked this movement, has written a response far more dignified and mature than the articles attacking her. But the nastiness has only just begun. As some of us can testify, the viciousness of the lobby groups funded by the fossil fuel industry, and the publications that amplify their message, knows no limits. As we have already seen, they treat even children as fair game. I would suggest that the climate strikers develop clear rules of engagement, in order to give their opponents no ammunition. In my view, the global justice movement was gravely damaged by its failure to exclude or contain the black bloc: people dressed in black, some of whom came to protests tooled up for a fight and often smashed up random local businesses, denting support for the mobilisation with every blow. Some people in the movement believed that everyone had a right to join it on whatever terms they wished. I see this as an unaffordable indulgence. A good exercise is to ask yourself what the police and authorities would most like to happen, then do the opposite. They would love a violent faction to emerge that would erode the young strikers’ credibility and provide an excuse to send in the riot police and break up the protests. Never give them this excuse. Successful movements also need an organisational model that allows them to keep growing. One promising approach is Big Organizing, through which campaigners create proliferating networks, each branch of which trains the branches that grow from it. It helped Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez take her seat in the United States Congress. They need clever, funny and innovative tactics, which take opponents by surprise and create a sense of forward momentum. Designing such tactics, narratives and principles is, I believe, best done by a small number of people, then put to the wider group for approval. I saw how Occupy became bogged down in the impossible process of developing complex policies through consensus. All this is a lot to dump on young people. But there are plenty of veterans, many of whom have far more experience than I do, who are ready to offer advice and help. Any support must come on the young strikers’ terms: they lead, we follow.

"Australia’s frog species, already threatened by habitat destruction and disease, are being put under extra pressure by shifting rainfall and rising temperatures from climate change. Some of Australia’s leading frog experts are worried that serious impacts could be unfolding out of sight, with one saying climate change could push certain species to extinction before they are documented by science. Many of Australia’s frogs are found nowhere else in the world, but the continent is also at the coalface of climate impacts with extreme heat, droughts and rising temperatures. Frogs are known to be at a high risk from climate change because they are ectotherms, animals with a body temperature regulated by their environment. Global populations of frogs and other amphibians have already been devastated by chytrid fungus, a disease that broke out in the 1980s and 90s. Now climate change could wreak havoc too.  Prof Michael Mahoney, of the University of Newcastle, has spent three decades studying the amphibians. “It’s the cumulative impact,” he says. “Yes there are some frogs that were greatly reduced because of the fungus. If they now face the added insult of climate change impacts, it just makes everything all that harder.” To make matters worse, Australia’s 2016 national plan to reduce the impacts of the fungus speculated that climate change and warmer temperatures could also increase the vulnerability of amphibians to the disease. Mahoney says all frogs have a different “critical thermal maximum”, a temperature above which they die, so they have to find places to hide and stay cool and moist. “The problem then is, how many refuges are there? The effective habitat that’s available is getting smaller and smaller. Can the frogs keep pace with current climate change? We don’t quite know the answer to that.” Mahoney says some Australian frog species live in high elevation rainforests and cool temperate areas with a thermal maximum of 29C. “Anything above that, and they die,” he says. “In the last four to five years, there have been four or five days that have gone above 32C [in those areas].” Climate change will have a slower impact than the fungus outbreak: “It will be a much more steady process of decline. That gives us more time to look at adaptation, but it’s also frightening because people become complacent.” Dr Jodi Rowley, a frog expert and biologist at the Australian Museum and the University of New South Wales, says there are about 240 known frog species in Australia. However, it’s estimated about 20% of all the likely frog species in Australia have not been named and described in scientific journals. She said in south-east Asia “deforestation is happening faster than we can discover species in the forest” and the same problem could be hitting frogs in Australia. “It’s theoretically possible that same thing could happen due to climate change, even in Australia,” Rowley said. “We also don’t know how the fungus will change and interact with climate change. Because frogs are so influenced by temperature and humidity – like the fungus – in warm dry years they huddle together and transmit disease between themselves.” Dr Laura Brannelly, a conservation biologist at the University of Melbourne, studies how frogs cope with climate change and disease. “For frogs in particular, climate change is a real threat because they rely so much on water availability, and water patterns are changing across Australia particularly in regions like the Australian Alps,” she says. For example, the habitat of the endangered alpine tree frog, says Brannelly, has been hit by drought and reductions in snowfall. “If there’s no snowfall, it messes with their breeding cycle. I suspect a lot of declines will be happening [in alpine regions] and climate change is a contributing factor. “One or two consecutive bad years of extreme drought could cause an entire small population to completely disappear, which is a huge worry for species on the brink.” Tabitha Rudin, of the University of Western Australia, is researching the crawling frog that is widespread across the southwest, an area, she says, that has seen a drop of about 19% in winter rainfall since the 1970s, with further declines predicted. “Such drying conditions pose a growing challenge for many amphibians, particularly for terrestrial-breeding species as they deposit their eggs on land rather than water and rely on consistent rainfall whilst embryos are developing.” Crawling frogs are able to live in places with markedly different average annual rainfall, meaning even within the species some might be better adapted to drier climates than others. Rudin is looking to see if a technique known as “assisted gene flow” could be used to help this species, and perhaps many others, by breeding to encourage tolerance for drier conditions. She has already produced hybrid offspring in the laboratory with greater tolerance to drying conditions. “We now have to test whether this positive effect remains over multiple generations,” she says. Rowley says a major problem for frogs is that there is comparatively little data about where they are, and so tracking changes caused by climate change or disease is hard. To tackle this, she co-founded FrogID, a citizen science project that’s trying to track frog locations by getting users to record their calls. “People want to know what’s going on out there with frogs and they notice changes, but the data just isn’t there,” she says. “We get lots of anecdotal stories from people who say they just don’t hear them around any more.”"

"Tony Abbott has changed his mind and now says Australia should stay in the Paris climate agreement. Abbott, who signed up to Paris when he was prime minister but then declared that Australia should pull out during the prime ministership of Malcolm Turnbull, confirmed he had changed his mind again during a debate on Friday morning with the independent challenger Zali Steggall and other federal election candidates in his seat of Warringah. Asked by moderator David Speers if his change of heart was due to the ousting of Turnbull as prime minister, Abbott said it partly was. “I certainly thought that the only way to break the emissions obsession was to pull out of Paris,” he said. “I think that the government has lost its emissions obsession now that Angus Taylor is the energy minister … Circumstances have changed. We have a new prime minister and a new energy minister.” “So when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister we should have pulled out?” Speers asked. Abbott replied: “We had an emissions obsession that needed to be broken and changed. I am now confident that we can meet our Paris targets without significant damage to our economy.” Abbott backed the creation of new coal-fired plants, even saying that the Snowy Hydro 2.0 project, which is owned by the government, should now look into investing in new coal projects. “We do need more baseload power in the system,” he said. “Why not coal-fired power? Coal fire remains the cheapest form of baseload power.” But it isn’t. Today the cheapest form of new dispatchable or base load energy is renewables plus storage. We are now able to have lower emissions and lower prices but we need to plan it using engineering & economics rather than ideology and innumerate idiocy “Because of political risk it’s very difficult for most investors [to invest in coal], but there is no reason why Snowy, as a government entity, couldn’t take a much longer view. Snowy would fund hydro, that stacks up. If we take the long view, then absolutely coal stacks up too.” Steggall, an independent who promised to run a climate-focused campaign, rejected this, and said the claim that coal was the cheapest was incorrect. “Coal is not economical. It still plays a part in our energy mix, and there needs to be a gradual retirement of coal…The reality is that the cheapest form of power is renewable.” “Not 24/7,” Abbott replied. “When the wind blows, but otherwise not.” Steggall: “That’s the most ludicrous argument… There is no question of intermittency. ” .@TonyAbbottMHR: I think we do need more baseload power in the system and why not coal-fired power? It remains the cheapest form of reliable baseload power. I'm all in favour of renewables, provided they're economic.MORE: https://t.co/ykweMevBOK #SkyLiveNow pic.twitter.com/X2O0lWUOiS Turnbull also tweeted his thoughts in real-time during the debate, challenging Abbott. “Today the cheapest form of new dispatchable or base load energy is renewables plus storage,” he wrote. “Snowy Hydro 2.0…delivers the massive storage which does make renewables reliable and this enable our progress to lower emissions and lower energy prices.” Steggall told the audience “it will be a climate election” and said she wanted a 60% reduction of emissions by 2030, compared to 2005 levels – higher than both Labor and the Coalition. “My platform is that the new generation wants a new era and movement on climate change,” she said. “It will be a climate election. People want movement.” Abbott took 51.6% of the primary vote at the last federal election, but faces a strong challenge from Steggall, who has pitched her campaign as a high-profile local with a heavy emphasis on the environment. Steggall also took aim at Labor’s proposed franking credit policy, which would end the cash refunds for dividend imputation credits given to retirees and those with self-managed superannuation funds who earn below the tax threshold. “I think it is an absolutely appalling proposal by Labor, I think it is extremely divisive,” she said. “You are now saying to [retirees with excess credits] ‘Thanks for paying all your taxes for all those years and by the way, we are now going to stick you in your retirement.’” However in a fiery debate with a lot of interruptions, neither Abbott nor Steggall offered a response when Speers asked the panel if they knew the current generation cost of a new coal-fired plant. Only the Greens candidate, Kristyn Glanville, and the Labor candidate, Dean Harris, offered the figure. Steggall also offered support to the idea that Australia should slow its immigration intake, as Abbott called for a “substantial reduction”. “In my discussions with millennials and younger Australians,” Steggall said, “there is a concern that immigration levels are too high in relation to the level of infrastructure … I wouldn’t go as far as Tony Abbott, but [immigration] needs to be done in an orderly and measured way.” Another independent candidate, Indigenous broadcaster Susan Moylan-Coombs, said Australia should be open to immigration by people who would be forced from their homes due to rising sea levels in the Pacific and Torres Strait. The debate also covered local issues such as the proposed Beaches Link tunnel and kicked off a fierce debate over whether residents would be able to take their surfboards to the beach. Harris said he opposed the project because it “puts more cars on the road” and would worsen congestion. “It won’t help parents get their kids to school in the morning. It won’t help people get to the beach on the weekend,” he said. Abbott replied: “How do you take your surfboard on the bus?” “Well how do you take it through the tunnel?” said Harris. “Of course you can,” Abbott said. Steggall said she supported the tunnel, but wanted it paired with clean public transport. “From the millennial generation and down, they are not interested in car transport. They want electric vehicles on the market. They want clean public transport. The reality is that there needs to be a tunnel that does create that access. “You would be surprised,” Steggall said. “Kids take surfboards on their bikes.” “Not longboards,” Abbott said."
"There was a time on these temperate islands when freak weather thrilled us with its bouts of exceptional heat, wind, rain or snow. Unless you were at sea in a gale, fear was a rare emotion. Even in 1987, when the so-called Great Storm hurtled through southern England and northern France on a night in mid-October, it was possible to be more awed than afraid. Crashing branches and tumbling slates woke people, but when they turned to each other in bed it was to exclaim about the wind’s strength – “Would you just listen to that!” – rather than to see it as a portent of something larger or more terrible. Thirty-odd years later, most of the people who lived through the Great Storm remember it mainly because a BBC weatherman got the forecast wrong. In England, the wind gusted at 120mph that night, and at least 22 people were killed on both sides of the Channel. But unless you were among the bereaved, or had a tall oak fall through the roof, nobody felt anxiety or despair. There was no prevailing gloom.  The writer Jonathan Raban witnessed the scene in Hyde Park, where small crowds had gathered around the gaping craters left by uprooted trees, and buzzsaws made the park “as noisy as a logging camp”. Raban noted a popular reaction. “It’s so sad, people said, trying to quench their smiles – for they didn’t feel sad at all,” he wrote. “They were thrilled by the magnificent destruction of the wind: it was as if the world itself had come tumbling down, and even the shyest, most pacific people in the crowd felt some answering chord of violence in their own natures respond to this tremendous and unlooked-for act of violence in nature itself.” That seemed true to me. As a child, lying late in bed on a Saturday morning, I would imagine that the bedstead had electric-powered wheels and could be driven anywhere in any weather, while I lay snug with a hot-water bottle under a waterproof quilt, steering the bedstead into gales and downpours. Growing up beside the sea, I could repeat this juxtaposition of comfort and danger by nestling on a stormy afternoon in a little hollow above the shore to watch the big, grey waves smash over the rocks as if they had taken against them. From a vantage point that was safe and relatively warm, the weather presented itself as an entertainment. Sometimes, clearly, it was more than that. In 1953, looking out from our living room on a rolling sea, I heard adults speak gravely about how the same storm had sunk the ferry Princess Victoria on its passage to Northern Ireland, with the loss of 133 passengers and crew. And in January 1968 a stronger and even more damaging wind than the Great Storm of 1987 tore west to east across Scotland, leaving 20 people dead and several hundred homeless. Working a late shift on a Glasgow newspaper that night, I thought I saw the glass in the office windows bend inwards before it broke; a scene that might belong to the Book of Revelation (“And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail…”). But as the idea of a punitive God had died long ago, even on a Presbyterian paper such as the Scottish Daily Express, weather was left as a series of random events unconnected to any human activity. Still, tentative connections were being made. By the early 1960s, scientists knew beyond doubt that concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were rising; there was, or could be, a “greenhouse effect”. In 1975 the geophysicist Wallace Broecker popularised the phrase “global warming”, at least among the scientific community, when he included it in the title of an academic paper. It was only in 1988, however, that it began to be seen as a pressing global concern – thanks largely to the testimony of the climatologist James Hansen before a US Senate committee, the formation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and the work of the writer Bill McKibben, whose book The End of Nature, published in 1989, was an early primer to climate change’s likely effects. The 30 years since have been lived out in a kind of denial: not in terms of international conferences and demonstrations, or the growth in renewable energy and the search for the perfect electric car, but in our apparent belief that nothing fundamental will change. McKibben wrote in Granta magazine in 2003 that people still thought about global warming “in the way they think about ‘violence on television’ or ‘growing trade deficits’, as a marginal concern to them, if a concern at all … hardly anyone has fear in their guts”. For many people, that may still be true: “FABruary: record-breaking sunshine [as] UK has hottest winter day ever”, announced the Sun’s celebratory front page on Tuesday, with any reference to climate change confined to a final paragraph on page five. But that treatment seemed old-fashioned somehow, and discordant with a belated but gathering alarm at the prospect of crop failure, biodiversity loss, water scarcity, forest fires, sea-level rise, soil degradation, mass migration and all the other horsemen in the cavalry of the apocalypse that threatens to sweep through the world before the end of the century. A new American bestseller, The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells, lays out the territory with the slogan, “It is worse, much worse, than you think”– though its prophecies are drawn from scientifically respectable projections that are far from worst-case. How can we live with this prospect and not go mad? The website of Extinction Rebellion, which aims to change government attitudes to climate breakdown through nonviolent resistance, carries a film, Heading for Extinction and What to Do About It, which is one of the plainest bits of film-making you will ever see. A female scientist stands in what looks to be her modest kitchen and talks for an hour to a small audience (never in shot) about human civilisation’s probable fate. “Traditionally, you try to be a bit hopeful,” she says at the beginning, “but this is a different kind of talk.” What we need, she says, isn’t hope but courage. We’re heading towards three degrees of warming, and that will be catastrophic, “like boarding a plane that has a one in 20 chance of a crash”. Halfway through her talk, she allows her audience two minutes to grieve for our future losses. Then she invites us to act – to modify the future terror through present acts of peaceful protest. Is it really worth trying? That, she says, is the wrong question. We must act out of “a desire to be a worthy ancestor”. When Raban visited Hyde Park in 1987 to look at the fallen trees, none of that speech was imaginable. We had then, and for some time after, yet to feel fear in our guts. • Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist"
"Whenever Australia starts to have a serious conversation about addressing climate change, headlines appear in newspapers of an economic apocalypse. This happened again in the Australian this week based on work by a long-standing economic modeller of climate policy, Brian Fisher. So, what do economic modelling exercises tell us of the impact of reducing Australia’s contribution to global warming, and more importantly, what do they not? Should we cower in fear of action or embrace the inevitable change and manage the human and economic costs of transition?  Firstly, economic modelling results are not predictions. They are based on hypothetical future worlds. Economists try to capture the dynamics of economic systems in their models to understand the relative impact of different policy options. This means they are always wrong because economists can’t predict the future. Economic modellers are not the crystal ball gazers we read about in fantasy books. Leading energy commentator and founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Michael Liebreich, sums this up nicely. His graph shows what US government energy models have been projecting over the years compared with what is happening in the real world. Over and over again models have failed to capture how fast the cost of clean energy has been falling and the scale at which it would be deployed. This does not mean the economic models are not useful, it just means they should be used to test the relative impact of different policy options and not be presented as predictions of the future. They have a long history of overestimating the costs of environmental regulations because people and markets can innovate faster than they often expect. Secondly, the way economic modelling results are presented is very important. Industry groups in particular like to attach themselves to particular results and scream that thousands of jobs will be lost, or wages will be slashed. This is designed to scare people into not acting on climate change by making them feel insecure in their lives. The headlines in the Australian did just this. It is also dishonest because they also don’t clearly put the results in the context of the broader change in the economy. (David Gruen, one of Australia’s top economic officials gave a great speech about this in 2008 to illustrate how long this silliness has been going on.) To illustrate my point, the economic impacts Fischer has projected for different emissions targets are in the same ballpark of those projected for work commissioned by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade a few years ago. This work also presented results in a similar way to the Australian. However, what is also showed is that the economy, jobs, income, etc continued to grow regardless. We keep getting richer and have more jobs, we just do so at a slightly slower rate.  Thirdly, because Australia exports a lot of coal and other emissions-intensive products to other countries, what they do matters an awful lot to the Australian economy. As other nations reduce emissions, demand for these products falls regardless of what we do. It has been established for some time that a significant part of the economic impacts of climate change on Australia comes from things we can’t control and this is generally presented in the results (see here for an example). While he does not report this, Brian Fisher knows this because he spearheaded economic analysis in the 1990s that was targeted at convincing Japan, one of our major coal markets, it would be too costly for them to reduce emissions. Lastly, whenever these headlines are blasted across the papers one point is always lost: these results don’t include the cost of climate change itself. This summer, we have again seen a glimmer of what climate change will mean for Australia. Recent economic analysis indicates the benefits of limiting global warming far outweigh the cost of doing so, in one case by 70-1 (a good summary is here). (Again, this is something Fisher has considered in the past as he once said it would be cheaper to move people from the Pacific and put them in condos on the Gold Coast than act on climate change.) So, as we head into another cycle of climate change politics in Canberra, beware the economic doomsayers and the threats from industry groups that credible action will be a “wrecking ball” to the economy. To be glib, no one said saving the Earth would be free. Acting on climate change will have costs but the costs of not acting will be far, far larger. Better that we come together and manage a fair and effective transition than continuing to delay and pay a much, much greater bill later.

"Green groups say Australia’s biggest coal producer Glencore should commit to withdrawing from new coalmining projects if it is serious about aligning its business with the goals of the Paris agreement. The company has moved to cap its output of thermal and coking coal at current production levels of 145m tonnes a year after pressure from investors who want companies to take stronger action and factor in the financial risks of climate change.  Glencore says the decision to cap coal production and focus investment on commodities including nickel, copper and cobalt used in the renewables industry does not mean it intends to drop greenfield coal projects in Australia, such as its Wandoan coal project in Queensland’s Surat Basin. The project has been on hold for several years for economic reasons because it would require investment for both the mine and associated new infrastructure. In New South Wales, the company’s proposal for the expanded United Wambo Project in the Hunter Valley is being assessed by the NSW Independent Planning Commission and the forecast tonnes of that project are already contained within the 145MT cap. “Glencore has been very clear that we closely consider market conditions before bringing on new coal projects as they need to be economically sustainable over a long period,” a company spokesman said following the announcement. “As older mines in our portfolio come to the end of their economic life, all coal projects will be considered. This includes our Wandoan Coal Project.” Lock the Gate, which has been campaigning for communities that would be affected by the Wandoan or United Wambo projects, said the company’s statement on Wednesday sent “a powerful signal that thermal coal is in decline globally”. But Carmel Flint, the group’s campaign coordinator, said it may not go far enough, because deep cuts were needed to meet Paris climate targets, “and maintaining current levels of production is not sufficient to deliver on that”.“The true test of the statement will be in whether Glencore acts immediately to withdraw from new coalmining projects it has on its books – especially the proposed Wandoan coal project on the Western Downs of Queensland and the United Wambo project in the Hunter Valley in NSW,” she said. The Australian Conservation Foundation said the company had been “dragged” by investors to implement a cap and it should be a warning to promoters of coal in public debate, including the Morrison government. “As a result of this decision Glencore should make an unequivocal announcement that controversial greenfield coalmine proposals in Australia that local communities have been opposing for years, such as Wandoan on prime farming country in Darling Downs, will not proceed,” ACF’s climate and energy program manager Gavan McFadzean said. Rod Campbell, research director at the Australia Institute, said “it’s not like Glencore has suddenly gone green”. “But I think they’re getting good publicity out of some very sensible thinking that coal production doesn’t need to increase,” he said. “It’s only in the bizarre energy politics of Australia that this is really big news.” Glencore’s announcement is one of a number by major companies in recent months – including BP, Shell and Maersk – about their responsibilities around climate change. It follows work by the Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative pushing the world’s biggest emitters to reduce emissions and improve financial disclosures related to climate change. Emma Herd, the chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change and a member of the Climate Action 100+ steering committee, said more companies would be making similar statements in the future. “I can definitely say there will be more announcements in the months ahead from very big companies related to climate change,” she said. “People tend to think of this as climate activism or investor activism but actually what it is is these are very big, very mainstream investors who want very big and mainstream companies to have a plan on climate change. “This is some of Australia’s and the world’s biggest institutional investors and pension funds saying you have to have a plan on climate change. They’re asking because they’re trying to manage risk in their own portfolios.” Energy research and consulting firm Wood Mackenzie said Glencore’s announcement suggested it was chasing “value over volume” because of its dominant position in the premium thermal coal market. “In a 2C scenario, premium thermal coal demand is expected to be resilient compared to other coal types,” research director Prakash Sharma said. “That means companies holding on to high-energy thermal coal assets stand to gain and will realise higher prices. Glencore sits comfortably in that space due to its competitive cost position.”"
"Climate change was responsible for the majority of under-reported humanitarian disasters last year, according to analysis of more than a million online news stories. Whole populations were affected by food crises in countries ravaged by by drought and hurricanes such as Ethiopia and Haiti, yet neither crisis generated more than 1,000 global news stories each. In Madagascar, more than a million people went hungry as corn, cassava and rice fields withered under drought and severe El Niño conditions. Almost half the country’s children have been stunted, but their suffering sparked few headlines. Sven Harmeling, the climate change lead for Care International, which commissioned the report, said: “Not only are the people who live in the world’s poorest countries most vulnerable to climate change, but they are also the least equipped to address its increasing impacts. Media must not turn a blind eye to such crises and the role of climate change.” Asad Rehman, the executive director of War on Want, blamed a “climate change reporting that prefers pictures of polar bears to those we are killing with our inaction”. He said: “Climate change has long had its fingerprints over untold killer floods, droughts and famines. Unfortunately the people being sacrificed every day to the climate crisis are those least responsible for it. They have been deliberately made invisible because the lives of those with black and brown skins simply don’t matter.” Around the world, extreme weather events claimed about 5,000 lives in 2018, and left almost 29 million people in need of humanitarian aid and emergency assistance. The Care report links climate change to civil disasters in Sudan, Chad, the Philippines, Madagascar and Ethiopia, and says it played an exacerbating role in Haiti. Nine of the 10 most neglected tragedies occurred in countries in the Africa Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of states. Dr Viwanou Gnassounou, the ACP’s assistant secretary general, said: “We try always to show that these disasters are linked to climate change but we have to fight to get our points heard. We have not been very successful until now. The [media] coverage is poor and [reported] in terms of ‘disaster’ – not linked to climate change or its consequences.” Gnassounou, who is also the ACP’s sustainable development spokesman, said that donor countries sometimes implicitly linked crisis aid to silence about climate change. “They will never say it formally but it is part of the conversation,” he said. “They prefer that you condemn yourself by saying that you did not have a proper policy to prevent disaster and now you need their support.” Scientists have tended to be wary of attributing individual weather events to global warming but many are increasingly reluctant to underplay trends in line with climate models. Last year, the European Academies Science Advisory Council said climate change this decade had been “fundamentally responsible” for driving a 50% increase in flood frequencies and a similar surge in storms, droughts and heatwaves. In July, the World Meteorological Organisation described extreme heatwave conditions as “consistent with what we expect as a result of climate change”. Later that month, one of the world’s leading climate scientists, Prof Michael Mann, described accelerating extreme weather events as “the face of climate change”. However, Dr Friederike Otto, the deputy director of Oxford University’s environmental change institute, added a note of caution. She said: “Not every humanitarian disaster has climate change as a major player. Some are actually being made less likely by climate change. And in some, climate change only plays a minor – if any – role.”"
"There’s an inspiring new slogan gaining traction among venerated pundits and politicians of a certain age that claim steadfast commitment to the cause of stopping catastrophic climate change: “Get off my lawn.”  Most recently, California senator Dianne Feinstein, 85, scolded a group of middle-schoolers with the group Youth v Apocalypse, who had joined the Sunrise Movement to call on Feinstein to back a resolution in the Senate supporting a Green New Deal. In a now infamous exchange, Feinstein barked that “I know what I’m doing” and that she has “been doing this for 30 years”, so they better just bugger off and let the adults work. (To be fair, the video was edited to comply with Twitter’s content guidelines. In the full clip she also offers them an internship.) When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey introduced their resolution for the Green New Deal, House speaker Nancy Pelosi, 78, off-handedly called it the “green dream or whatever”, before backtracking later in the day and voicing support for the enthusiasm of the idea – just not the resolution itself. Months earlier, Congressman Frank Pallone, 67, battled Ocasio-Cortez’s resolution to create a select committee on the Green New Deal based on unfounded, territorial fears that it would undermine the authority of his prized energy and commerce committee. Former Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen, 72, recently told the Financial Times the Green New Deal was simply too expensive to work, joining a record number of economists in backing a modest carbon tax as the more “feasible” and “sensible” option. New York Times columnist Gail Collins, 72, mused that Green New Deal campaigners would be better off sticking to “one really important climate-control thought”, perhaps – she spitballed – wind power: “If the country really threw itself into wind power, we could, er, breeze toward our goals on that alone.” None of these figures deny climate change in the conventional sense of spouting junk science from rightwing thinktanks. They have all agreed publicly and even forcefully that climate change is a pressing issue, and that human activity is its cause. Several have been vocal advocates for climate action of one sort or another. But none have proposed a workable alternative to the economy-wide mobilization the Green New Deal sets out to accomplish, to rapidly electrify the American economy and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. Details still need to be worked out on that plan, of course. But it remains the only idea on the table even remotely approaching the “wartime footing” climate scientists are increasingly insistent is necessary to avert catastrophe. The kids, in other words, are right. They will also be the ones forced to live with the consequences of the choices politicians make in the next several years. That’s not an unfamiliar dynamic in climate politics. Residents of climate vulnerable nations who are already dealing with rising tides and temperatures have long been the ones pushing for the most ambitious action at the international level, chanting “1.5 to survive” through the halls of UN climate talks. Communities in the US forced to live with the health impacts of extraction – from Houston to the Bay Area – have for years sought an end to the drilling that’s threatening to cook us. As they have in the last few weeks, adults in the room – whether US negotiators at the UN or big beltway conservation organizations – have in each case offered sage counsel: be realistic! Yet realism on climate means something different than it did even a decade or two ago, when a modest carbon tax and a smattering of tax credits might have gotten the job done. As the IPCC noted in its latest report, avoiding climate breakdown at this point will mean a “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”, including massive investments in renewable energy and new technology and going to war with the world’s most powerful industry, fossil fuels. Thankfully, Sunrise, Ocasio-Cortez and other Green New Deal advocates are updating our shared definition of what being realistic in a climate-changed 21st century looks like. The adults in the room would do well to listen. Kate Aronoff is a freelance writer"
"Western Australia’s environmental protection authority has announced tough new measures aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions from large projects. The EPA, which works independently and makes recommendations to the WA government about whether new developments should be granted environmental approval, said on Thursday it was setting a “higher bar” for how it would assess the impact of major projects on the climate.  The authority’s chairman Tom Hatton told reporters in WA the move was necessary because Australia was not on track to meet its Paris targets and the current policies of the federal government “are not going to deliver the outcomes as currently applied that are necessary for Australia to meet its international obligations under the Paris agreement”. Under the guidelines developers proposing projects with direct emissions of more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per annum would be required to demonstrate they have taken all “reasonable and practicable design measures”, including use of renewable energy, to reduce or avoid emissions. They will also have to offset all net direct emissions associated with the project. The EPA’s guidelines note that the Australian government’s key climate policy, the emissions reduction fund and its safeguard mechanism, lacks “an effective carbon restraint or rate”. The EPA also expressed concerned about the trajectory of WA’s emissions, which had increased by 27% from 2000 to 2016. “Western Australia has the second highest per capita emissions of all Australian states and territories, with emissions per capita well above those of other developed economies, including resource-based economies such as Canada,” the guidelines state. Environment groups have welcomed the policy as a “balanced approach” that would bring environmental benefits and require polluters to make greater effort to reduce their carbon pollution. The Wilderness Society said it was “a sensible policy for modern times”. “This is a huge step forward for policy,” Kit Sainsbury, the state director for TWS, said. “It’s really going to a limit a lot of projects going forward, particularly LNG (liquefied natural gas) and, potentially, also fracking.” Sainsbury said it was an example of states stepping in, in the absence of effective federal policy to combat climate change. Australia’s emissions continue to increase and the federal government has faced criticism this week for suggesting the opposite, based on one particular measurement of data from a single quarter. Much of the increase has been attributed to rising emissions associated with the LNG industry, particularly WA’s Gorgon LNG plant. The Conservation Council of Western Australia said the new policy would deliver jobs and environmental benefits for the state. “While this policy does not explicitly rule out new fossil fuel developments, it is a big step forward that could make a huge contribution to controlling pollution growth while helping to drive new sustainable industries for WA,” the council’s director Piers Verstegen said. The guidelines could have implications for major developments proposed for WA, including Woodside Energy’s proposed $11bn Scarborough offshore gas project. A spokeswoman for Woodside said tackling climate change “while providing the energy the world needs” was a complex challenge. “The projects that Woodside is proposing in WA will not only underpin jobs, investment and gas supplies – they will also make a significant contribution to emissions reduction by offering countries the opportunity to switch to cleaner burning natural gas,” she said. “To make investments like these, business needs stable, national – preferably international – policy frameworks, such as a global carbon price.” She said the “direct and arbitrary” regulation proposed by the EPA “appears out of step with Australia’s international targets and the associated emissions trajectory, raises further potential for conflict between regulation and jobs, and may perversely penalise investment in cleaner fuels such as natural gas which have a big role to play in global emissions reduction. The spokeswoman said the EPA had not consulted with proponents of projects that might be affected. The WA government said the guidance, released by the EPA as an independent authority, was not a government policy but set the EPA’s expectations when considering greenhouse gas emissions related to a proposal. “The McGowan Government is fully supportive of our job-creating LNG industry and will listen to their views as part of our response to the EPA,” the environment minister, Stephen Dawson, said."
"The turn the debate on asylum seekers has taken in the lead-up to the federal election has led to comparisons with the Tampa crisis and fears we are in the thick of Tampa 2.0. To be sure, fear remains as powerful a currency as it was in 2001. The prime minister’s recent scaremongering language suggests the government will deploy the Tampa playbook which goes along the lines of “How to use race politics to get votes and wedge your opponents”. We are not in the thick of Tampa 2.0 though.  The circumstances of the Tampa crisis have contributed to the world we inhabit now, but that world is not the same as it was in 2001. Many have described the crisis prompted by the MV Tampa as one of the most dramatic events in Australia’s history. Like many dramatic events it seemed to come out of nowhere. In one sense this is true. The Palapa – a dilapidated Indonesian fishing boat packed with 438 mainly Hazara refugees – was rescued by a Norwegian freighter on open waters, but anxiety about boat arrivals had been building for years. Immigration detention centres across Australia, from Port Hedland to Villawood, were full. Unauthorised boat arrivals which had human cargo incorrectly but commonly described as “illegals” made for a charged political issue. 26 August 2001 was a turning point. The MV Tampa rescued asylum seekers north of Christmas Island, an operation Captain Arne Rinnen saw as a standard international rescue at sea. He never imagined that the Australian government would not allow the asylum seekers on board to disembark at Christmas Island. The high-stakes action unfolded quickly. The SAS boarded the ship when it entered Australian waters. The same day, the government presented its border protection legislation to parliament. Meanwhile, there was a frantic rush to establish a detention centre on Nauru, money no object. The public seemed to love this “decisive action”, as the prime minister John Howard called it.  As talkback radio made clear, Howard’s statement that “we are not a soft touch” not only resonated, it united voters behind him in their antipathy towards asylum seekers. Howard had dismissed the United Nations’ criticism of Australia’s mandatory detention policy for years. Voters who weeks before may have been inclined to give their vote to Labor’s Kim Beazley, would not be swayed by international law or human rights advocates either. Journalists were kept busy covering challenges to the Tampa legislation and the internal agonies of Labor. But it was difficult, deliberately so, for them to report in detail on the new border security regime. Media relations were funnelled through defence minister Peter Reith’s office. It controlled the story, ensuring that the refugees on board and later housed on remote islands remained faceless and nameless. Focus shifted to New York and Washington after the September 11 attacks. In one crucial respect, however, the Tampa crisis and the terror attacks were conflated. A narrative took hold that asylum seekers might be terrorists too, seeking to blow up buildings and attack our way of life. We were at war; John Howard’s press conference announcing the November election happened to be held on the same day the United States started bombing the Taliban in Afghanistan. Years later in 2019, refugees continue to be demonised. There are far more displaced people than there were in 2001. Manus Island and Nauru are still in operation. But there is growing disquiet about the policy of indefinite detention, whichpolling reflects. Unlike 2001, we now know the names of some detainees and hear them in their own words through social media. Celebrating Behrouz Boochani receiving a major Australian literary prize or Abdul Aziz Muhamat winning a major human rights award is tinged with shame about their circumstances on the Manus Island prison, as they call it. We know the names of the men who have died too, including Omid Masoumali. Craig Foster wrote in a letter to Scott Morrison and Bill Shorten that raising international support to free Hakeem al-Araibi – something most Australians supported – from jail in Bangkok was difficult because of Australia’s own detention of refugees. Challenges to journalism have been relentless since 2001, and visas to Manus and Nauru nearly impossible to obtain. The Paladin affair makes clear how little transparency there is.  Howard himself has always argued that his government was making a comeback in the polls before Tampa. What is true is that his government was united, unlike Morrison’s government. It wasn’t besieged by a new scandal every other day in the league of Paladin, Helloworld or the Australian Workers’ Union raids inquiry. There were memorable byelections in Ryan and Aston earlier in 2001, but senior members of Howard’s government weren’t resigning in the last days of the parliament, as Julie Bishop and Christopher Pyne have done in the past fortnight. Crucially, the source of voters’ deepest fears has shifted. The existential – and actual – threat in 2001 was terrorism. We argued about the Kyoto protocol then, but now climate change is what panics us. Now it is harder to merge the issues of national security with asylum seekers, which may be why the home affairs minister Peter Dutton appears to channel Donald Trump at his most base when he suggests some offshore detainees may be rapists and paedophiles. The inadequacy of the government’s response to the new climate reality is stark. When Australians come to vote in May, memories of the hottest days on record, floods, fire, drought and massive fish kills will hold more sway than Dutton’s accusations about asylum seekers.

"We, the young, are deeply concerned about our future. Humanity is currently causing the sixth mass extinction of species and the global climate system is at the brink of a catastrophic crisis. Its devastating impacts are already felt by millions of people around the globe. Yet we are far from reaching the goals of the Paris agreement. Young people make up more than half of the global population. Our generation grew up with the climate crisis and we will have to deal with it for the rest of our lives. Despite that fact, most of us are not included in the local and global decision-making process. We are the voiceless future of humanity.  We will no longer accept this injustice. We demand justice for all past, current and future victims of the climate crisis, and so we are rising up. Thousands of us have taken to the streets in the past weeks all around the world. Now we will make our voices heard. On 15 March, we will protest on every continent. We finally need to treat the climate crisis as a crisis. It is the biggest threat in human history and we will not accept the world’s decision-makers’ inaction that threatens our entire civilisation. We will not accept a life in fear and devastation. We have the right to live our dreams and hopes. Climate change is already happening. People did die, are dying and will die because of it, but we can and will stop this madness. We, the young, have started to move. We are going to change the fate of humanity, whether you like it or not. United we will rise until we see climate justice. We demand the world’s decision-makers take responsibility and solve this crisis. You have failed us in the past. If you continue failing us in the future, we, the young people, will make change happen by ourselves.

"The record-breaking warmth at the end of February was remarkable, but as cases of extreme temperatures become more common do they have any effect on people’s attitudes to the climate? A fascinating study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal looked at more than 2bn tweets in the US about unusual cold or hot weather, and revealed that people get used to such extremes fairly quickly. As time goes by and unusual weather becomes more frequent, people seem to view the new highs and lows as simply the normal state of the climate, and memories of the weather years ago fade away.  One of the researchers, Frances Moore, of the University of California, Davis, said: “We are experiencing conditions that are historically extreme, but they might not feel particularly unusual if we tend to forget what happened more than about five years ago.” Getting used to unusual weather may not seem like a big deal, but if these extreme cases are seen as fairly normal it may be colouring the public’s perceptions of climate change. And that is worrying at a time when action is urgently needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. "
"Australians have paid about $2m from the Morrison government’s emissions reduction fund, now rebadged as a “climate solutions” policy, to mining giant Rio Tinto for a diesel-fired power station at a mine in Arnhem Land. The multinational company qualified for climate funding to help pay for the fossil fuel plant at its Gove Peninsula bauxite mine despite the generator being commissioned before the fund opened.  It is one of several fossil fuel developments by large companies registered with the fund, which the then prime minister Tony Abbott introduced to pay farmers and businesses to cut greenhouse gases below what they otherwise would have been. Environmentalists and academics are calling for the scheme to be scrapped or narrowed so it does not support fossil fuel projects and includes a tougher test of whether developments would have gone ahead without public money. National emissions have risen each year since the fund was introduced with an initial $2.55bn four years ago. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Monday the fund would be renamed and receive an extra $2bn over a decade, or $200m a year. Rio Tinto has received carbon credits and related payments for a 24MW diesel power station built in 2014 after it closed an alumina refinery and heavy fuel oil generator. A 180MW heavy fuel oil station had provided electricity and stream for the refinery, mine and the town of Nhulunbuy and nearby Indigenous communities. The fuel was expensive and contributed to the refinery becoming unviable. Rio Tinto considered replacing it with gas but could not reach an agreement with the Northern Territory government on a supply deal. In December 2014, the company announced it had installed the smaller diesel plant, saying it was “better suited to the needs of our operations and the community”. The plant was registered with the emissions reduction fund 10 months after starting operation and has since sold 188,221 carbon credits to the government through the fund, estimated to be worth about $2m. Projects that receive backing from the fund are required to be new. Asked why Rio Tinto had been allowed to register a diesel plant that was already operating, the Clean Energy Regulator, which administers the fund, said the company was required only to give a “notice of intent” before the project started. A Rio Tinto spokesman said it did this in August 2014, more than a year before its registration under the fund was formalised and became public. He said eligibility for carbon credits informed the decision to build the plant, which had resulted in a reduction in emissions of about 215,000 tonnes. Paul Burke, an economist at the Australian National University’s Crawford School of Public Policy, said it was clear from when the emissions reduction fund was introduced that it could lead to “anyway projects” – developments that would have existed regardless – getting public money. He said the fund was better suited to a niche role paying for emissions cuts from activities that could not easily covered by other policies. “This type of subsidy scheme is much more useful for projects such as savannah burning,” he said. “We have much smarter policies available for the electricity sector and large industrial projects.” In the case of Rio Tinto, he said: “A carbon price would have fully given them the incentive to do this project if they needed an additional nudge. It would have been a smarter approach.” Cash from the fund is distributed through reverse auctions, with the cheapest cuts proposed winning contracts. Across eight auctions, $476m has been paid and another $1.8bn contracted, with $226m left unspent. A Guardian Australia investigation last year found it was at best often unclear if the fund was offering value for money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere. More recently, it revealed Vales Point coal-fired power plant had registered a proposal to upgrade some turbines and South African gold miner Gold Fields is receiving climate funding for a gas-fired power plant it says it would have built anyway. Asked on Monday whether climate funding should help miners pay for gas plants they would have built anyway, the environment minister, Melissa Price, told ABC radio that most of the money had gone to land projects. She said the fund was a good environmental and economic policy. It was part of a $3.5bn suite of climate measures announced by the prime minister, including support for pumped hydro storage, a second Bass Strait electricity cable and promised energy efficiency and electric vehicle programs. Tim Baxter, an associate with the Australian-German Climate and Energy College, said a further issue with the payments to Rio Tinto is that the site was also covered by the safeguard mechanism, which is meant to ensure industrial facilities do not increase their pollution above business-as-usual levels. Major emitters that breach an agreed baseline are supposed to buy carbon credits to offset the increase. But the mechanism has been criticised as lax for allowing companies to nominate their baselines. Baxter said in the case of companies both covered by the safeguard mechanism and registered under the emissions reduction fund, taxpayers ended up paying polluters to make cuts they were supposed to pay for themselves to meet their baselines. Rio Tinto’s Gove operation fell into this category. “In this situation, the fund is no longer delivering actual carbon reductions,” he said. “It’s literally paying people to do what they already had to do.”"
"Al Gore continued an environmental justice tour with a visit to poor areas of Alabama – and warned that already dire conditions are set to worsen because of climate change.  The former vice-president met people in Hayneville, near Montgomery, and heard them describe dire sanitary conditions as open pools of sewage pockmarked their lawns after a night of heavy rain. Later Gore told a town hall gathering that he found the conditions “shocking and tragic”. It’s all connected to the climate crisis, he told the 100-plus crowd crowd, referencing “rain bombs” from the ever-growing number of annual hurricanes hitting the south-east. Gore visited with civil rights campaigner the Rev William Barber, and Catherine Flowers, the director and founder of Alabama Center for Rural Enterprise. Gore drew connections between poverty, ecological devastation and systemic social inequality. Lowndes county’s open-piping sewage – and its long-term effect residents’ health – has been documented by reports from the United Nations and studies on tropical diseases which show that some illnesses such as hookworm are making a comeback in areas where it was once thought eradicated. “This looks like the civil rights movement never took,” Barber said, staring down at the patchwork of sewage at his feet and walking around the brown liquid taking up much of the street. The area feet away from this neighborhood, Barber said, made up the route of the march Martin Luther King took from Selma to Montgomery in the 1960s. There is very little sewage infrastructure in Lowndes county, Flowers told the Guardian, echoing similar sentiments from 2017 when she estimated 80% of the county remained uncovered by a municipal sewerage system, leaving some residents to find their own solutions. “The problems that are visible [in Hayneville] and the solutions that would work here are integrally connected to the problems that are being seen in the world right now, and the solutions that would work right now,” Gore said, explaining why he chose to visit. Jerome Means, a 63-year-old African American resident showed Gore the sewage running into his yard and home. Behind his one-storey brick home is a sewage lagoon, a pond full of raw, brown liquid. Gore asked him how many times it had to be pumped. “Three times a week!” Gore shouted in disbelief when he heard the answer, his voice rising. On top of that, Means, a retired city employee who has lived in Hayneville for 20 years, pays a “sewage fee” to avoid such overflows. “The problem is that, in these communities, they’ve applied these cheap fixes that don’t work,” Flowers said. “And with climate change it has only gotten worse.” A sewage truck comes by every three days to pump out the mess, Meanes explained. “If not, it would fill out the yard.” As if on cue, a few minutes later, a sewage truck came by and its driver greeted Means by name. Across the street, 70-year-old Charlie May Holcombe keeps her great-grandchildren away from their outdoor swing set as sewage covers its base. She can’t remember the last time the children were able to play outside the home. And they’re not even safe from sewage inside the house. “I’ve replaced the carpet more times than I can count,” Holcombe, a great-grandmother, said as she sat the top of her driveway, just feet away from the sewage line. Her great-grandchildren ran toward the chain-link fence, trying to play in the brown liquid, but Holcombe shooed them away. “Nobody cares about us,” she told Barber and Gore. Both men each took a hand and listened as she cried. “We’re going to try to get help,” Gore said. “Almost every person is dying from cancer, asthma, heart trouble. I tell you something is wrong. All of us are suffering from the same thing,” Holcombe said. “Why is nobody researching it?” she kept asking. Holcombe has congenital heart disease. Gore said the area needed a systemic solution – not emergency stop-gaps like sewage trucks. “The cost of sending that truck out there three days a week instead of treating the asthma, cancer and other diseases that doctors suspect are so strongly related to these conditions … you add up all those costs, just on sheer economic ground alone, it would make sense to fix this and extend the sewage treatment infrastructure out there,” he said. Before Means goes back into his house, he told the Guardian he was leaving his home in Hayneville but was unsure where he will go. He said he was tired of the constant struggle with sewage, the stench, the frustration. Though Means had not told Gore he was leaving, Gore alluded to Means’ plight later in the day. “Maybe we need to treat them as environmental refugees,” he said."
"Hundreds of youth climate activists marched on Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s Washington office and 42 of them were arrested by police, according to organizers. The protesters – who planned for the arrests – were led with their hands behind their backs to a police bus as supporters chanted: “Which side are you on now? Which side are you on?” They filled the Republican leader’s office and the hallway outside, with constituents from his home state of Kentucky telling stories about poverty and their fears of the human cost of climate change.  The group, the Sunrise Movement, which included high schoolers, demanded to talk to McConnell about the Green New Deal (GND), a proposal introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey. The GND would radically reduce greenhouse gases and try to lessen social inequity. Republicans have condemned it, and some Democrats have said it is not feasible in the 10-year timeframe proposed. McConnell has said the Senate will vote on the proposal, in a move that could put centrist Democrats in a difficult position. The Sunrise Movement called McConnell’s plans for a vote a “shameful ploy”. They say he has fought any action to stall global warming. A staffer greeted the group and took down contact information. Protesters from Kentucky said they have repeatedly sought meetings with McConnell. Robert Steurer, a spokesman for McConnell, said: “As with all Kentuckians visiting DC, we welcomed them to the office today. It’s worth noting that two weeks before, Senator McConnell had already announced that he will be bringing the Green New Deal up for a vote in the US Senate. Also last week, Senator McConnell’s state director met with a group of students from the organization in the Louisville office to discuss the issue.” One protester from Kentucky, Jenny Bencomo-Suarez, yelled inside McConnell’s office: “He has not answered a damn voicemail.” She said: “He has consistently denied access to us – access to resources, access to jobs, living wages, healthcare and the right to sustain ourselves in a livable, breathable future.” Destine Rigsby, a 17-year-old from Louisville, said of McConnell, who did not appear: “You line your pockets while we die in floods and choke on the air we breathe, yet you don’t even have the decency to look us in the eyes.” Last week, California Democratic senator Dianne Feinstein faced criticism over her response to a group of children and teenagers from Sunrise who were also asking her to support the GND. A video of the incident went viral on Twitter after Feinstein appeared to lecture the youngsters. The group later accused her of reacting “with smugness + disrespect”."
"It is right that the analysis of how our climate has changed is properly rooted in documented science. Similar rigour should be applied to whether, and how, this issue is included in the curriculum. The claim that climate change is a “peripheral subtopic” in geography is simply not supported by the evidence (Teachers demand emphasis on climate change in curriculum, 22 February). For example, the statutory geography national curriculum requires that pupils study how our climate has changed from the ice age to the present. In addition, pupils should also understand how human and physical processes interact to influence and change landscapes, environments and the climate; and how human activity relies on effective functioning of natural systems.  Comparable requirements are also included in geography GCSE and A-level courses, which are studied by 250,000 and 35,000 pupils respectively each year. By combining study of the physical and human worlds, geography provides a unique context to study how our climate is changing and how we might adapt to and mitigate against the changes; an education that all pupils deserve and that geography can provide.Steve BraceHead of education and outdoor learning, Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

"The students striking from schools around the world to demand action on climate change have issued an uncompromising open letter stating: “We are going to change the fate of humanity, whether you like it or not.” The letter, published by the Guardian, says: “United we will rise on 15 March and many times after until we see climate justice. We demand the world’s decision makers take responsibility and solve this crisis. You have failed us in the past. [But] the youth of this world has started to move and we will not rest again.” The Youth Strikes for Climate movement is not centrally organised, so keeping track of the fast growing number of strikes is difficult, but many are registering on FridaysForFuture.org. So far, there are almost 500 events listed to take place on 15 March across 51 countries, making it the biggest strike day so far. Students plan to skip school across Western Europe, from the US to Brazil and Chile, and from Australia to Iran, India and Japan. “For people under 18 in most countries, the only democratic right we have is to demonstrate. We don’t have representation,” said Jonas Kampus, a 17 year old student activist, from near Zurich, Switzerland. “To study for a future that will not exist, that does not make sense.” The letter says: “We are the voiceless future of humanity ... We will not accept a life in fear and devastation. We have the right to live our dreams and hopes.” Kampus helped initiate the letter, which was created collectively via a global coordination group numbering about 150 students, including the first youth climate striker, Sweden’s Greta Thunberg. The strikes have attracted some criticism and Kampus said: “We wanted to define for ourselves why we are striking.” Another member of the coordination group, Anna Taylor, 17, from north London, UK, said: “The importance of the letter is it shows this is now an international movement. Taylor said: “The rapid growth of the movement is showing how important it is and how much young people care. It is vital for our future.” Janine O’Keefe, from FridaysForFuture.org, said: “I’ll be very happy with over 100,000 students striking on 15 March. But I think we might reach even beyond 500,000 students.” Thunberg, now 16 years old and who began the strikes with a solo protest beginning last August, is currently on holiday from school. She was one of about 3,000 student demonstrators in Antwerp, Belgium on Thursday, and joined protesters in Hamburg on Friday morning. In recent days, she has sharply rejected criticism of the strikes from educational authorities, telling the Hong Kong Education Bureau: “We fight for our future. It doesn’t help if we have to fight the adults too.” She also told a critical Australian state education education minister his words “belong in a museum”. The strikes have been supported by Christiana Figueres, the UN’s climate chief when the Paris deal to fight global warming was signed in 2015. She said: “It’s time to heed the deeply moving voice of youth. The Paris Agreement was a step in the right direction, but it’s timely implementation is key.” Michael Liebreich, a clean energy expert, said: “Anyone who thinks [the strikes] will fizzle out any time soon has forgotten what it is to be young.” In the UK, about Taylor said more than 10,000 students went on strike on 15 February: “I’m anticipating at least double that on 15 March.” The strikes would not end, Taylor said, until “environmental protection is put as politicians’ top priority, over everything else. Young people are cooperating now, but governments are not cooperating anywhere near as much as they should”. She said students were contacting her from new countries every day, including Estonia, Iceland and Uganda in recent days. Kampus, who was invited to meet the Swiss environment minister, Simonetta Sommaruga, on Wednesday, said: “The strikes will stop when there is a clear outline from politicians on how to solve this crisis and a pathway to get there. I could be doing so many other things. But I don’t have time as we have to solve this crisis. My dream is to have a life in peace.”"

"Scott Morrison has promised to help accelerate the construction of a new interconnector between Tasmania and the mainland, and has signalled the government will back the Snowy 2.0 expansion as part of the Coalition’s climate policy reboot. The prime minister confirmed on Monday the government would spend $56m in an effort to progress a new 1,200MW interconnector as part of Tasmania’s “battery of the nation” project and he also sent a strong hint he will back Malcolm Turnbull’s pet project, adding 2,000MW of new generation capacity at Snowy Hydro.  The Tasmanian project is a plan to double the state’s renewable energy capacity by developing pumped hydro energy storage, building windfarms and upgrading existing generation assets. Fourteen pumped hydro sites have been earmarked across the state with a combined potential generation capacity of up to 4,800 megawatts. Under the plan, renewable energy would be exported to the mainland if a planned second interconnector goes ahead. The additional generation projects and transmission infrastructure, as well as potential action to assist the rollout of electric vehicles, were flagged during a speech in Melbourne in which Morrison promised to rebadge and top up funding for the existing emissions reduction fund to the tune of $2bn over 10 years as part of a climate policy pivot. The prime minister, who has faced internal pressure from MPs to give them something constructive to sell to voters on climate change, said the government was committed to addressing the challenge, and insisted a package of measures will ensure Australia meets its commitments under the Paris climate agreement. One of the measures the government has factored in to help meet the 2030 target is a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030). The government’s policy shift was panned by Labor, the Greens, a range of climate experts and environmental groups. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said Labor would scrap the fund if it won the next federal election. “This has been their policy for the last five years, with exactly the same annual amount put into it as Scott Morrison has promised for the future, and yet we’ve seen carbon pollution go up year upon year, projected to continue to go up all the way to 2030,” Butler said on Monday. “This is a failed policy”. Bill Hare, a climate scientist and the director of Climate Analytics, said the emissions reduction fund was “a failed policy”, with all independent analysis showing it had not reduced emissions to the extent the government claimed. “They certainly have not shown up in the national emissions, which continue to increase,” he said. Hare said the amount of annual funding proposed by Morrison halved what the original policy provided under Abbott. He said the government had also taken no steps to rectify problems with the scheme, including that emitters were currently able to use the safeguard mechanism to increase their emissions. “The bigger issue is there’s no way the Australian taxpayer can pay for the emissions reductions needed, and nor should they,” Hare said. “The polluter-pays principle needs to be applied and that means a carbon pricing system would enable companies to make an investment in their production that would benefit taxpayers and the bottom line.” The Australian Conservation Foundation said the emissions reduction fund had done nothing to cut carbon pollution since its introduction and it was difficult to see how continuing with the same policy would lead to a different result. “There are serious questions about the governance, effectiveness and value for money of the emissions reduction fund that a new name won’t fix,” Gavan McFadzean, the ACF’s climate change and clean energy program director, said. “A responsible climate policy must include a whole-of-government and whole-economy approach to reducing pollution, but today’s announcement contains nothing about the energy sector or transport or agriculture or major industry – nothing about cutting pollution from the most polluting parts of our economy.” Neneh Darwin, a campaigner at Greenpeace Australia Pacific, said topping up the fund was a choice by the government to do “as close to nothing” on climate policy as possible. “First step in fixing the climate crisis is powering past coal – but the government is doing every single thing it can think of to delay that, including trying to actively prop up the industry by throwing as much taxpayer money at it as they can”, Darwin said. The Investor Group on Climate Change, which has been focused on the financial risks associated with climate change, said by continuing with the same policy the government was not addressing the serious economic risks climate change exposed Australia to. “There is a significant gap between the government’s current target and the objectives of the Paris agreement. This is of great concern for investors, as global warming above 1.5-2C would have large and detrimental impacts on global economies, society and investment portfolios,” the group’s chief executive Emma Herd said. Herd said the government needed to close the gap between its long-term Paris commitments and the current policies urgently. She said investors were increasingly worried about climate change and would keep pushing governments to adopt policies that enabled a smooth transition to a net zero emissions economy. “The government’s support for investigation into stronger network connection with Tasmania and large scale energy storage is important,” she said. “This work should be undertaken in the context of the energy market operator’s Integrated System Plan and embedded within a strategy to achieve net zero emissions in the electricity sector.”"
"In a world where climate change makes every season unpredictable, we have perhaps got used to unseasonal warm spells. But if I cast my mind back to the middle of February 1998, I can still recall my surprise at the unusually mild weather. I was filming at a west London gravel pit with Bill Oddie, and during the course of the day we saw four different species of butterfly on the wing. They were the quartet that habitually overwinter as adults – comma, peacock, small tortoiseshell and brimstone – each emerging on a mild spring day to feed on nectar.  The cause of this unexpected warm spell was high pressure over the continent, which brought warm air up from the Canary Islands and north-west Africa. This tropical maritime airstream meant temperatures reached the mid-teens across much of southern Britain, and even at night stayed much higher than normal. On 13 February, at Greenwich in south-east London, the temperature reached 19.7C (67.5F), breaking the UK February record. Of course, it could not last, and by the 15th a cold front began to bring slightly cooler air – along with Sahara dust. But for a few days, we had a preview of what winters might be like if we cannot stop climate change – and, butterflies aside, it was disturbing."
"Let’s start with the good news. Scott Morrison is talking constructively about climate change because he is intelligent enough to understand that failing to do that renders the Coalition unelectable in parts of the country, and with parts of its own base. Compared with where we’ve been, a Liberal prime minister standing up at a podium, accepting the science of climate change and making the case for action, is progress.  We need to acknowledge it. But this isn’t, ultimately, a test of talking points. It has to be a test of substance, and a test of whether or not you are prepared to be a grown-up government facing up to a significant policy problem – and the truth is the Coalition has been here before. Right on this spot. John Howard had a very similar epiphany in 2007, delivering a speech in Melbourne within sight of an election in much the same way Morrison did on Monday. Like Morrison, Howard knew the Coalition needed to switch course on climate policy because Australians then, like now, were fretting about extreme weather and the droughts that never seemed to end. Howard signed the Liberal party up to emissions trading during his 2007 pivot. But after he lost the election to Kevin Rudd, madness descended inside the Coalition, and raged in full public view for a decade, with that madness killing most of the optimal policy solutions for dealing with emissions reduction. While Morrison would like us to think that was all a bit of a bad dream, and the Coalition has actually been tremendous on climate policy despite all the compelling evidence to the contrary, the truth is the madness still defines the parameters of the policy. Monday’s climate policy pivot reflects Morrison’s limited options. He’s unveiled a reboot of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action policy, kicking in more cash to the emissions reduction fund (although the cash only pans out at $200m a year), and giving it a new business card. This mechanism will deliver some abatement, a significant chunk according to the government’s own projections, but the persistent question over the ERF as a mechanism (apart from why taxpayers have to pay, as opposed to big polluters) has always been whether it delivers any abatement beyond what would have happened anyway. To put it simply: you can call the ERF a Climate Solutions Fund if you like, but giving it a reassuring sounding new name does not transform it into a mechanism designed to do the heavy lifting on emissions reduction that really needs to happen. I could call myself Beyoncé too if I wanted to. It wouldn’t make me Beyoncé, sadly. Other elements of the putative reboot include (probably) helping to build an interconnector between Tasmania and the mainland to maximise the potential of hydro (which is a useful development), and (presumably) pressing ahead with the Snowy 2.0 project that has been ready to go since last December. Despite not yet signing up to the expansion, the government has already built Snowy into its projections for meeting the Paris target. Nifty, huh? There’s also something coming on electric vehicles, but there is no sign yet of an emissions standard for vehicles that would have any prospect of reducing pollution meaningfully from the transport sector. Flag that sort of thing and Nationals start rhapsodising about man’s inviolable right to his SUV. The government is also failing to bite the bullet in other ways. We are building a big chunk of carry-over credits into our projections for meeting the Paris target, which you might be more sanguine about if there was evidence of a real emissions reduction plan, with real teeth, lined up against a bit of creative accounting to ameliorate some of the short to medium-term dislocation associated with transitioning a carbon intensive economy such as Australia’s to a low-emissions economy. Just one more problem. You also have to line up Monday’s “climate solutions” pivot with the climate problem the government will create for itself if it proceeds to lock in more coal-fired power to Australia’s energy grid, underwritten by taxpayers, which is what the energy minister, Angus Taylor, keeps hinting he wants to do. In order to hit reset on climate policy in a way that has some prospect of cutting through with the cohort of voters inclined to desert the government over this issue, and this issue alone, Morrison needed to do two things on Monday. He needed to say sorry for all of that insanity. He needed to say I don’t know what came over us, but we aren’t going to do that again. Prime ministers can do that in two ways. The first is to just say it, but that’s very hard for risk-averse politicians who equate public acts of humility with public acts of weakness. The second is do it by implication: put forward a serious policy program that is an implicit apology for past misdeeds, and in so doing, project that you are prepared to stare down any internal brinkmanship that ensues. That didn’t happen on Monday, and it didn’t happen on Monday because we all know what happens when the Coalition hits these particular tipping points. Just ask Malcolm Turnbull."
"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, freshman congresswoman and social media sensation, has taken time out from baiting Donald Trump and establishment members of her own party to raise a profound moral question for us all: in light of the escalating climate emergency, should we still be having children? During a recent Q&A live-streamed on Instagram, apparently shot while she was pottering in her kitchen, the rising star of the Democratic party – and one of the few frontline politicians to get the scale of the environmental emergency – pulled no punches in telling viewers that unless we take urgent, radical action on emissions, there is no hope for the future. “It is basically a scientific consensus that the lives of our children are going to be very difficult, and it does lead young people to have a legitimate question: is it OK to still have children?”  With this one question put to her 2.5 million Instagram followers, Ocasio-Cortez has stumbled into a highly contentious area. Population has long been a controversial factor in the climate change debate; one recent study said the most effective thing individuals can do to address the crisis was to have one less child. However, critics insist we should focus instead on overconsumption, and that putting the onus on individuals to address climate change obscures the systematic nature of the crisis. Crucially, they say, it lets the real culprits – fossil fuel corporations and successive global governments’ inaction – off the hook. And even if you accept the premise that having fewer children will tackle climate change, there is also the thorny question of exactly who should be having fewer kids: an American is responsible for 40 times the emissions produced by a Bangladeshi, but often those who advocate population reduction focus on women in the developing world. Ocasio-Cortez is not encouraging people stop having children. And as the leading advocate of the Green New Deal plan – which aims to radically transform the US economy by 2030 – she is one of the few politicians to be working on a plan that might just offer a way to avoid the worst impacts of this crisis. But perhaps she is raising a more profound issue. Faced with a future of social and political breakdown, flooding, deadly heatwaves and food shortages – and a world full of politicians in various states of denial – why shouldn’t young people question whether bringing children in the world is a good idea? The answer is one we must all grapple with. But it is worth remembering that throughout history – even in the most horrific circumstances – people have continued to have children. It is a profoundly human act. And the thousands of young people who took to the streets to voice their concern around the climate crisis in recent months are a reminder that often – far from being the problem – children embody a profound hope for the future.

"Some headed for the beach while others took refuge in air-conditioned buildings to escape Australia’s unprecedented weeks-long heatwave this summer. But for ecosystems up and down the country – languishing far from the cities and the social media glare – there was no escape.  Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology confirmed 2018 was the hottest December since records began in 1910, while January was the hottest month ever recorded. Climate change has altered Australia’s weather patterns. The BoM and CSIRO say the country has warmed by more than 1C since 1910, and temperatures will continue to rise. There have been obvious signs: bushfires, drought and coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef. But there have also been less headline-grabbing climate change-related tragedies. Based on studies of past extreme heat events, the affect of this summer’s heatwaves on Australia’s flora and fauna would have been severe, fundamental and, in some cases, deadly. “I think in a lot of places it would have been carnage,” says James Cook University ecologist Prof Bill Laurance of the January heatwave. “We have just had records after records being broken. We only tend to notice when things start dropping out of the trees. We know that basically, lots of things are dying.” According to the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO, Australia has warmed by 1C since 1910, and temperatures will increase in the future. So how will climate change affect future heatwaves in Australia? The CSIRO and BoM have compiled different models for predicting the outcome of climate change in Australia to produce a guide to how different regions will likely be affected. They found that every part of Australia will continue to experience increases in average temperature, and will have a higher frequency of hot days. The duration of hot spells will increase in every region. In many areas in the northern half of Australia, the average number of days above 35C could increase by two to three times. Late in the century, towns such as Darwin, Alice Springs and Broome  may experience days with temperatures above 35C for about a third of the year. These higher temperatures will also result in higher evaporation, which will continue to make drought conditions worse. Prof Ary Hoffmann, a biologist at the University of Melbourne, has studied the impact of climate change on natural systems for more than two decades. “You are going to get some major ecosystem changes,” he says, “but it’s the interactions that drive things. Our extremes are getting much greater, and so the consequences are going to be greater.” One study found: “Summer heatwaves and winter warm spells will increase in frequency, duration and amplitude across Australia.” Increases in extreme heat conditions and shifting rainfall patterns have already been seen across the continent. One 2018 study, led by Hoffmann, pulled together eight case studies showing how aspects of climate change such as drought, extreme heat and changes to rainfall were working together to devastate ecosystems. Pest outbreaks – themselves likely promoted by climate change – were harming trees already struggling though persistent droughts and heatwaves. Intervals between bushfires were not long enough to allow seeds to germinate and “drastic management interventions” were required to keep alpine ash ecosystems viable. Birds and mammals in the wet tropics were moving up mountains to stay in their preferred temperature ranges. According to Laurance, the damage caused by climate change is mostly out of sight of field biologists, and major problems caused by heatwaves can go undetected for years, if they are found at all. He cites the case of the rare white lemuroid ringtail possum. In 2008, after hearing reports the possums had gone missing, Laurance tried to find one in north Queensland. He and others concluded a heatwave three years earlier had killed many, pushing the species closer to the brink. The possums cannot survive for more than a few hours if temperatures rise above 30C. “Lots of people think heatwaves will be dangerous for things in cooler climates, but probably the tropics and tropical mountains will be where we lose most of our biodiversity,” Laurance says. “We know that in heatwaves animals have a temperature threshold and above that, they start to die. “There are silent crises happening all around us and it might be a few years down the track that we work out the skinks and frogs and plants that have died off.” Heatwaves cause the most damage when they arrive on top of other stressors such as fragmented habitats, drought, disease and fire. Last year scientists published an analysis of a 2011 heatwave in Western Australia. They found it had affected an area larger than Victoria – more than 300,000 sq km – spanning land and ocean. An article published in the journal Scientific Reports said the heatwave caused “tree die-off and coral bleaching” as well as “terrestrial plant mortality, seagrass and kelp loss, population crash of an endangered terrestrial bird species, plummeting breeding success in marine penguins, and outbreaks of terrestrial wood-boring insects”. Co-author Joseph Fontaine, an ecologist at Murdoch University, says: “We are getting more heatwaves and less time in between them. If you are a plant that’s close to your threshold then you’re going to die faster if it’s already hotter than it used to be.” The heatwaves have a knock-on effect, he explains: “Here in the south-west we have these fantastic black cockatoos and they rely on the resources in the trees – the seeds – from eucalypts and banksia cones. If these events affect trees, then the resources are gone and the trees won’t produce food the following year.” Ecologists are concerned by the speed of changes in the climate and how normally adaptable species are failing to keep up. “Given that in Australia the climate is so variable and most of our animals and plants should be adapted to that, we start to ask: why is it that we are seeing so many impacts?” says University of Tasmania climate impact scientist Rebecca Harris. “We keep talking about this as something that’s in the future, but we are seeing impacts now. Heatwaves and bushfires are what people are aware of, but there are many other impacts.” Last year Harris led a study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, looking at how Australia’s ecosystems coped with both long-term and sudden extreme climate change events. “A single extreme event can be sufficient to cause irreversible regime shift or an ecosystem ‘tipping point’,” the study said. Among the examples were the pencil pine forests in Tasmania devastated by fire in 2016; a “boom and bust” of extreme rainfall and heat in arid areas coinciding with massive outbreaks of rodents, and then bushfires; and in 2016 mangroves dying en masse along a 1,000km stretch of the Gulf of Carpentaria. “We thought those undisturbed places would be more resilient,” says Harris. “But we showed that just wasn’t the case.”"
"They were everywhere in London on the weekend. The people in short sleeves or sandals. The ones with sunglasses ostentatiously hanging from the front of their shirts or balanced on top of their heads. The beer gardens and riverside pubs of the capital were heaving; corner shops ran out of ice-cream. Outside it was 17C (62F). Monday was another warm day, without a cloud in the sky, and in the late afternoon the light took on a magical, honey-coloured hue. It brought to mind one of those summer evenings you remember from childhood, when you’d be in the park all day and your parents let you stay out until bedtime, and you felt like you were doing something deliciously naughty just by being there.  Except it isn’t early summer: it’s February. And the entire developed world has not so much been doing something slightly naughty as systematically attacking the global ecosystem over a period of decades, and that’s how we go into this mess. We should try to hold on to this fact as young, posh men the nation over develop a strange delusion that anyone would want to see their elbows; this is not supposed to be happening. Less than a month ago, there was video footage of extreme cold weather coming out of Chicago. Forks supported in midair by suddenly frozen noodles, water poured from kettles instantly freezing on its way to the ground: you know the sort of thing. OK, that was on the other side of the world, and was extreme and terrifying enough. But at least it was terrifying in the right direction. On Monday, though, the temperature hit 20.3C in Ceredigion, west Wales: the highest February temperature ever recorded in Britain and the first time the thermometer had breached 20C in winter. The BBC weather account tweeted it out with a gif of the sunshine icon and the same excitable breathlessness with which Springwatch would announce it had found a new type of vole. My response contained a single word, repeated seven times. It began with F. Because this isn’t good, is it? However enjoyable the unreasonable sunshine feels, whatever feeling of relief it instils in you after weeks of grey sky and Brexit, the idea of beach temperatures in February should be scaring the living shit out of you. It shouldn’t be possible to wander round London half-naked in February without bits of you falling off. There is a fairly direct inverse correlation between your ability to go out without a jacket at this latitude in winter and a polar bear’s likelihood of surviving the winter – yet the population of Britain wandered round with their shirts undone looking pleased with themselves. Nation of animal lovers my arse. Something has gone wrong. John Lanchester’s latest novel, The Wall, portrays a dystopian, post-climate change Britain in which the entire country has been walled off to prevent “others”, from the ruined, flooded world beyond, getting in. The young resent the old because the change happened on their watch; the state kills with ease, and slavery has returned. But it is set in a place that is still recognisable as this country, in which people go to pubs, get pissed, commute on crowded railway lines and think the Lake District is a nice place to go. It’s a vision that’s haunting precisely because it is so banal. You can believe in this future. The world is ruined, and the British people have conspired as much as possible to ignore the fact. The country’s response to this unseasonably warm spell suggests Lanchester may be on to something. The 20 hottest years on record have all happened within the past 22 years; the five hottest were the last five. Yet the beaches and the beer gardens fill up, while the papers describe the weather as glorious and expend more words on the latest Westminster soap opera than on the looming climate crisis. The thing about an environmental apocalypse is that it doesn’t have a face. There were those on Sunday who gave in to the heatwave a little too easily. They let themselves forget it was winter and found themselves, when the sun went down and the temperature dropped, suddenly shivering and unprepared for the cold. It feels uncomfortably like a metaphor. • Jonn Elledge is assistant editor of New Statesman"

"Dear Tony. We need to talk about your flip flopping. It’s just not reasonable to have every single position on an issue and present yourself to voters as a conviction politician. These two conditions are, fundamentally, irreconcilable. Let’s lay this out. When Tony Abbott was prime minister, he took the decision to sign Australia up to the Paris climate treaty. When Malcolm Turnbull took over the Liberal leadership, Turnbull went on to ratify the agreement. In 2015, when Abbott signed Australia up to Paris, he said we were making a “definite commitment” to a 26% reduction in emissions and “with the circumstances that we think will apply ... we can go up to 28%”. When that position became inconvenient, because he was waging war on Turnbull during the vicious internal proxy war over the national energy guarantee, Abbott then declared he didn’t anticipate, as prime minister, “how the aspirational targets we agreed to at Paris would, in different hands, become binding commitments”. In July 2018, Abbott argued Australia needed to pull out of the treaty (that he took the decision to sign up to) because: “I didn’t anticipate how agreeing to emissions that were 26% lower in 2030 than in 2005 would subsequently become a linear progression of roughly equal cuts every year over the next decade”. How Abbott didn’t anticipate this at the time was entirely unclear, given that’s how targets often work, and he was the prime minister who took the decision to adopt the target, presumably with extensive advice from his advisers and officials and the portfolio minister – but let’s not digress. Experience shows there’s not much utility in unpacking Abbott’s essential reasoning on climate change because another position will soon be taken, just as sure as night follows day. And so it was on Friday. Abbott was asked during a candidates’ forum broadcast by Sky News whether he still wanted to get out of Paris. Given the independent Zali Steggall is attempting to blast Abbott out of his seat of Warringah using climate change as the sharp end of her offensive, presumably it has become more difficult for Abbott politically to keep arguing Australia needs to get out of the treaty he signed the country up to. So Tony has shifted again. We don’t need to get out of Paris any more, the former prime minister said on Friday, because circumstances have changed. Well, yes, they have changed. Last July, Abbott was coming after Turnbull, because Turnbull had come after him, and he was coming after any policy that could have led to emissions reduction, because he’d made that deeply strange and corrosive crusade an article of faith with so-called fellow conservatives. The media bobble heads amplified their nonsense because conflict, however manufactured and bone-headed, is the new media currency. Now Steggall is coming after him. That is a change of circumstances. These weren’t, however the changed circumstances referenced by Abbott in Friday’s debate. The changed circumstances were the Coalition had now shaken off its “emissions obsession”. “We had an emissions obsession that needed to be broken,” Abbott reported like the duty doctor. “And it has now changed.” It’s not clear to me whether “emissions obsession” EO™ is a recognised medical condition or psychological disorder, perhaps someone could Google that if they get a minute, but in any case, Abbott noted that the terrible fever had broken. Tony’s pronouncement is somewhat inconvenient to the current prime minister’s efforts to convince progressive, centre-right voters that the Coalition can do something other than wreck on climate change. But never mind that, we were in good hands, Abbott told his interlocutor David Speers, because Angus Taylor was now the energy minister, and presumably is not in the grip of EO™. Good man, Angus. What is unclear though, is how Angus being a good man with EO™ immunity makes the Paris target any less than it was when Abbott signed up to it, recanted, then clambered back on board it again – but this way lies madness. Instead of getting frustrated with a performance that could be fairly categorised perhaps as the last stand of the political opportunist, perhaps we should just look on the bright side and celebrate the backflip on the backflip. Hooray. Friday’s about face from Abbott shows that political pressure does have an impact. But it also shows the member for Warringah blows with the wind on issues that matter; that his views on climate policy are entirely situational – and, seriously, will that prove a compelling pitch when voters put their papers in the ballot box in late May?"
"Jeremy Corbyn has downplayed the Brexit crisis by claiming that poverty and climate change are far greater priorities for Labour and the country. Addressing Scottish Labour’s annual conference, Corbyn said his party was not “obsessed by constitutional questions, like the others are. We’re obsessed, absolutely obsessed, with tackling the problems people face in their daily lives”. In an apparent effort to shift the focus away from his party’s deep divisions over Brexit, Corbyn said the UK’s greatest challenge was global warming. “We are facing a climate crisis. There’s no bigger threat to our future. And fundamentally, the destruction of our climate is a class issue,” he said. “We believe that the real divide in our society is not between people who voted yes or no for [Scottish] independence. It’s not between people who voted to remain or to leave the EU,” he told party members in Dundee. “The real divide is between the many – who do the work, create the wealth and pay their taxes – and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards, and dodge their taxes. So let me spell it out: our mission is to back the working class, in all its diversity. And that’s what drives our approach to Brexit.” Lesley Laird, the shadow Scottish secretary, echoed his emphasis on poverty and class in her conference speech. However, the party’s pro-EU parliamentarians believe Corbyn’s remarks were designed to highlight his hostility to anti-Brexit forces within his party. Ian Murray, a Scottish Labour MP at the forefront of the pro-Europe campaign, said Corbyn was right to point out poverty and climate change had been overshadowed by Brexit. But he added: “Where he is completely wrong is, we can’t resolve these issues with Brexit because Brexit makes delivery of them that much harder. His timing is off. The most meaningful vote on Brexit, the biggest vote in parliamentary history, is next Tuesday. So we need laser-like focus on that, please – and the rest we can deal with later.” Stephen Doughty, a pro-remain Welsh Labour backbencher, said Brexit was a “rightwing Tory project that threatens communities that depend on Labour. [There] is no such thing as a Labour Brexit or a jobs-first Brexit”. The Scottish party has been beset by bitter rows over Europe after a conference statement by its two MEPs, David Martin and Catherine Stihler, was allegedly edited to remove remarks in support of a people’s vote. With pro-European figures in the party convinced that both Corbyn and Labour’s Scottish leader, Richard Leonard, prefer Brexit to remaining in the EU, its Scottish executive decided to include backing for a second referendum in Sunday’s conference agenda only on Thursday night. Corbyn insisted that Labour would attempt to block Theresa May’s deal in Tuesday’s Commons vote and resist a no-deal exit from the EU. Hinting at his lack of enthusiasm for a second referendum, he stressed again that he wanted a general election, before adding that only if that did not take place “we will be ready to support a public vote to prevent disaster”. Corbyn said Labour would commit his party to a target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050, a goal many climate experts and campaigners say is not fast or ambitious enough to halt runaway climate change. “It’s working-class communities that suffer the worst pollution and the worst air quality,” he said. “It’s working-class people who will lose their jobs as resources run dry. And it is working-class people who will be left behind as the rich escape rising sea levels. “Big corporations will never do anything serious about it. The Conservative government will never do anything serious about it either. But Labour will make it a central objective of our industrial strategy. We need to reduce our net emissions to zero by 2050 at the latest. It’s not just an ecological priority – it’s a socialist priority too.” Corbyn also addressed the antisemitism problems engulfing Labour, saying he was “utterly determined” to rid the party of the scourge. He said that, rather than fighting within itself, his party should turn its fire on the Tories. “The only thing that can hold us back is if we were to turn our fire on each other rather than on the Tory government and the wealthy establishment interests they represent,” he told delegates. The Labour leader added: “Racism, religious bigotry and misogyny have no place whatsoever in any part of our movement. And we will root out antisemitism in our party, and in society at large. And I am utterly determined to achieve that.” "
"Emissions in Australia are continuing to rise, with the latest increases driven predominantly by an increase in liquefied natural gas production in Western Australia. Emissions for the year to September 2018 went up 0.9% on the previous year, according to the latest inventory, primarily due to a 19.7% increase in LNG exports, but there were also increases in stationary energy, transport, fugitives, industrial processes and waste sectors.  The increased pollution from stationary energy reflects production growth in the mining sector, in steel and aluminium. The increase in LNG production has driven a 7.3% increase in fugitive emissions over the year to September 2018. Transport emissions also increased 2% over the year to September, with an 8.4% increase in diesel consumption, reflecting increased diesel passenger vehicle sales and more freight activity. But emissions in Australia’s electricity sector continued to fall, courtesy of a 12.3% reduction in brown coal supply, and a 14.2% increase in generation from renewable sources. The latest data shows that emissions in Australia’s electricity sector peaked in 2009, and have decreased almost 15% from that time. The energy mix is also changing. Since 2009, coal generation has decreased from 83% of total generation to 75%, while gas has decreased from 9% to 8% and renewable generation, mostly wind and hydro, has increased from 8% to 17% of total generation. Emissions from agriculture also declined over the 12 months, according to the figures – a trend driven by a decreasing beef cattle population, decreases in emissions from agricultural soils and field burning of agricultural residues. There was also a reduction in fertiliser use in the 2017-18 cropping year, which followed more favourable growing conditions in the previous year. Parts of the country are in the grip of a prolonged drought. Confirmation that emissions are continuing to rise comes in the week where the Morrison government is attempting to execute a policy pivot on climate change to try to shore up its small “l” liberal heartland ahead of the coming election. Liberals are under pressure from a number of independent candidates, many of whom are campaigning against the government because of its record of frustrating climate policy action. Scott Morrison has this week revived Tony Abbott’s emissions reduction fund, rebadged it and given it funding of $2bn over 10 years – although environmental groups and a range of climate experts say that fund has absolutely no prospect of delivering the heavy lifting on emissions reduction required to see Australia meet its Paris target. As part of efforts to appeal to disaffected voters who now consider climate change a vote changing issue, Morrison has also pledged the government’s support for large renewable energy projects. The government has approved the Snowy 2.0 expansion, kicked in $56m for the Marinus link, and has flagged further taxpayer underwriting of the “battery of the nation” proposal. The government has also identified specified various components of an abatement plan which it says is consistent with Australia meeting the 2030 target. To meet the target, the government intends to count a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits, which is not practical emissions reduction but an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030. It is also factoring in emissions reduction from the Snowy 2.0 expansion; energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy for which there are no details; the rebadged climate solutions fund; additional hydro projects and just under 100Mt of abatement from unspecified “technology solutions” and “other sources of abatement” such as projects under development but not yet contracted. Labor attacked the government after the release of the emissions data on Thursday. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said carbon pollution levels had been rising since the election of Tony Abbott as prime minister, “and emissions will continue to rise all the way to 2030”. Butler said the rebadged emissions reduction fund would not counter the trend of rising emissions. “After five years and $2.25bn spent, Tony Abbott’s ineffective emissions reduction fund only saw pollution rise”. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, said the data confirmed “no matter how much money Scott Morrison throws into dodgy emissions funds, pollution will keep going up until polluters are once more forced to pay for their emissions through a carbon price”. “This latest data shows that while current investment in renewables has had some impact, it’s not enough to counteract increases in emissions across most of the economy, because corporations can pollute without penalty,” Bandt said."
"Absent from your otherwise fascinating survey of towels and toilet brushes (Ditch your loo brush, 21 February) was any recognition of the weird psychology of cleanliness. Beyond a certain point, it becomes irrational. To get or follow instructions from an OCD cleaner is very problematic – just look at the extent of her daily routines (and the amount of water she uses for washing). With OCD, a vivid imagination will supply all the motivation needed to spend every waking moment fighting against “dirt” seen or unseen. To those who have it, it is no joke; even worse is how the psychology can leach into the imaginary metaphysical world, with whole races, classes and genders becoming stigmatised as “unclean”. Instead of condoning this new disinfectant onslaught, promoted by advertising and media articles like this one, but with very little epidemiological basis, we should be discussing the possible effects of excessive hygiene and its weakening effect on the human immune system. The simple tools designed for bacteria cannot fight viruses. Luckily, apart from the professional cleaners there were a few “normal” experts who were more relaxed about cleaning issues. Balances have to be struck.

"How far ahead do your thoughts tend to stray? Tomorrow, next week, summer holidays? Perhaps some fleeting thoughts about the years ahead? But what if we stared deeper into the future? Reframing our thinking in this way would go a long way to saving the world, according to the geologist Marcia Bjornerud. In her mind-expanding book Timefulness she introduces us to “thinking like a rock” and seeing how our planet has evolved through deep time. Realising that dinosaurs dominated the planet for 180m years, while humans have been around for a mere 4m, suddenly puts a new spin on our “success”. Meanwhile, observing some of the major swings in Earth’s past climate, and the impact that these had on life, is both reassuring (the Earth looked after itself just fine and life evolved and came out the other side) and concerning (many species became extinct during these big changes).  Bjornerud argues that if more people saw the world through a geological lens, then humans might stand a chance of being as successful as the dinosaurs. Timefulness is a call to arms for all of us to consider how our actions today will affect future generations."

"The children’s climate strike has become another lightning rod in the never-ending culture war. Those on the left applauded them for their brave moral stand. Jonathan Freedland – not without basis – pointed to the strike as evidence that children were acting more like adults than the adults. But on the right the focus seemed to be on chiding them and telling them to get back to school – from the prime minister’s spokesperson to Toby Young, who saw the children’s behaviour as an argument for raising the voting age to 21.  So far, so predictable. And then came the waves of abusive comments and tweets in response. Teachers who “support this strike should have their assets confiscated and [be] sent to work down the salt mines”. “Oh do shut up you total fucking arse” the actor James Purefoy tweeted at Young to his 107,000 followers.  With all this discord you wouldn’t blame any child, unsure of what they think about the strike, for wishing that the adults would all stop fighting and just play nicely.  Who can blame young people for having little faith in adults when they see the chasm that separates what adults tell them and what they actually do themselves. It must seem to them that we are playing one huge game of Simon Says, where the object is to do the exact opposite of what we tell children to do. On a societal level we seem to be saying: do as I say, not as I do. So ask yourself: if you were a young person, would you really have much faith in adults to deal with the greatest challenge facing humanity when those selfsame adults – even teachers, such as me – are such blatant hypocrites?  We tell children to treat each other how they wish to be treated themselves, yet the House of Commons regularly resembles a playground fight, with the different sides jeering and sneering at each other. In the streets, we blare our horns and shout obscenities at other drivers. We hurl abuse at the opposition during the football and scream angrily at powerless call-centre workers when we are unhappy about something. All the while, our children watch. Just the other day, I took the children in my class to task for laughing too forcefully at the misfortune of one of their classmates. We talked about how they didn’t have the right to make another person feel worse about themselves, and I asked them to imagine how they would feel if they were in that child’s shoes. Fast-forward only a few hours, and I sat laughing as Jeremy Corbyn mocked the transport minister for yet another mistake. MPs, and indeed all of us, relish this sort of thing. Many a standup’s career is made from perfecting the pithy putdown. Our hypocrisy doesn’t stop there. As parents, families and teachers we tell children that mistakes are a good thing and that they are proof you are trying, a chance to learn. And yet we are far less forgiving when we are asked to put this in to practice as adults. Errors – true or perceived – by politicians, business leaders, sports people and co-workers are pounced on as evidence of their incompetence, unsuitability and negligence. Is it any wonder that so few of us are good at accepting responsibility for our mistakes when the response to doing so is damning? Just think how rarely we hear someone say: “Sorry. I was wrong.” Even when those words are uttered, more often than not they’re qualified by a conditional “if you misunderstood me” or “if anyone took offence”. It makes it hard to muster the audacity to stand in front of a class of young children and tell them to grow up and start taking responsibility for their actions. In my classroom in Spain, as in most others, “partner talk” is an essential part of most lessons. Children are encouraged to share their thinking with their partner and we even take time out to practise listening effectively. “Listen to understand rather than just to respond,” I tell them all. Because that’s how adults behave, isn’t it? I’ve stopped listening to BBC Radio 4’s The Moral Maze and Question Time as I just can’t cope with how little anyone actually listens (Melanie Phillips could learn a thing or two from my year 6 class). The contributors seem to have their idea of what the other person thinks – and is going to say – and will respond to this rather than what is actually said. But it’s not just in politics: I regularly argue with my wife about something she has said only to find out 10 minutes later that we were saying the same thing all along. The more you think about the depth of our hypocrisy, the worse it gets. We shouldn’t physically hurt others, we say, and yet violence is glorified in films, sport and music. Being different is good, we tell children, yet we live in monolithic echo chambers, cross the road to avoid people acting “weird” and pull funny looks if someone does something out of the ordinary in a public place. Knowledge is power, we say, yet experts are derided and belittled at every turn. Clever people are nerds, often figures of fun. And that brings me to the biggest hypocrisy of all, the mantra that you need to work hard to get ahead. Should our children really believe this when there is so much evidence to the contrary? Yes, we have inspiring examples, famous and non-famous, whom we can point to. But with social mobility decreasing, unthinkable amounts of wealth being held by just a tiny percentage of the population, and with an upswell in racism and bigotry across the western world, it stretches credulity to breaking point to suggest hard work is all that is needed for success. Maybe, just maybe, if we as adults actually started practising what we preached then our children wouldn’t need to go on strike and could instead focus on their own futures. But for the time being, with the adult world so filled with hypocrisy and inaction, I’m glad we have an ever increasing group of young people who aren’t listening to their elders, and instead are being seen and heard. • Richard Russell is a primary school teacher"
"Scott Morrison’s recent pivot on climate policy is unlikely to have a positive impact on Australia’s emissions profile because it fails to grapple with the underlying drivers of increased pollution, according to a new analysis by the Investor Group on Climate Change. The IGCC, a group that represents institutional investors such as super funds, with total funds under management of about $2tn, has told its members Morrison’s “climate solutions package” won’t change the current trajectory of rising emissions because it is “small scale and unlikely to be a durable policy framework through time”.  The group has also questioned the Coalition’s investments in Snowy 2.0 and Tasmania’s “battery to the nation”, arguing that these projects “could be crucial to decarbonising the electricity system” but also noting “they are not a substitute for private sector investment in new zero emissions generation and a national strategic plan for enhanced transmission and distribution”. The government has attempted to appeal to voters concerned about the Coalition’s record on climate action by rebooting and rebadging Tony Abbott’s emissions reduction fund; investing in large pumped-hydro projects; supporting energy efficiency measures; and also setting out a carbon budget detailing how it proposes to meet the Paris target. The IGCC is underwhelmed by the recent pivot. It says that until a policy is produced creating a credible pathway to net-zero emissions, investors will continue to sit on the sidelines. “In the absence of this, policy uncertainty will be increased, the necessary investment in zero emissions generation will be delayed and upward pressure will continue on electricity prices,” the new paper warns. The group is also critical of the government’s use of carry-over credits as a tool to ensure Australia complies with its obligations under the Paris agreement, warning that it will only delay the necessary transition, and increase the adjustment costs – socially and economically. The Morrison government is counting a 367-megatonne contribution from carry-over credits – an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030 – to help meet the 2030 target. The IGCC notes taht there is currently a gap between the targets that countries have set, and actions required to achieve the objectives of the Paris agreement. “For investors this is concerning because the economic and social impacts of current projected levels of climate change risk investment returns and economic prosperity over the longer-term,” the paper says. It points to recent economic analysis suggesting that, “conservatively, currently projected warming of 2.5-4C could reduce global economic output by 10% to 30% over the lifetime of assets and superannuation returns”. “The use of carryover to weaken Australia’s emissions commitments is also fundamentally at odds with limiting warming in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement and driving global momentum for coordinated, and increased ambition,” the paper says. “This could threaten to spread a low ambition contagion in the international system by further encouraging other countries like Russia to use carryover to delay emissions reductions.” The IGCC also says Labor is yet to take a position on the use of carry-over credits. It says that if the ALP uses the same accounting as the government, factoring in a 367-megatonne contribution in its carbon budget, Labor’s 45% emissions reduction target would become a 35% target. The most recent emissions data confirms that emissions in Australia are continuing to rise, with the latest increases driven predominantly by higher liquefied natural gas production in Western Australia. Emissions for the year to September 2018 went up 0.9% on the previous year, according to the latest inventory, primarily due to a 19.7% increase in LNG exports, but there were also increases in stationary energy, transport, fugitives, industrial processes and waste sectors. The trend of rising emissions has been in evidence since the Abbott government repealed the carbon price Labor legislated during the 43rd parliament. While boosting funding for the emissions reduction fund, the government has also this week foreshadowed changes to the accompanying safeguard mechanism. The changes will make it less likely that heavy polluters such as mines and smelters will be caught by the scheme in the short term – although the adjustments also set the mechanism up for a more seamless transition to a baseline and credit scheme, which Labor has flagged for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year. The safeguards mechanism – part of the Direct Action scheme, which is at the centre of Morrison’s recent climate redux – sets emissions “baselines”, or limits, for big polluters. The mechanism is supposed to ensure pollution cuts paid for through the taxpayer-funded emissions reduction fund – rebadged by Morrison last week as the “climate solutions fund” – are not undone by a blowout in emissions in other parts of the economy."
"The Greens have expressed alarm over changes to the emissions safeguard mechanism that will make it less likely that heavy polluters such as mines and smelters will be caught by the scheme – at least in the short term. In the week following an attempted pivot on climate change policy by the Morrison government, the Department of Environment and Energy has published amendments to the safeguard mechanism that take effect immediately.  The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, says the changes outlined in the new departmental edict “were requested by big polluters and they will make it easier for them to pollute more”. “This is like catching someone doing 100km/h in a 60km/h zone, but instead of fining them the government just lifts the speed limit to 110km/h,” Bandt said. The Coalition flagged an intention to overhaul the safeguards mechanism in a review of its climate policies released in December 2017. That review signalled baselines could “increase with production, supporting business growth”. The safeguards mechanism – part of Tony Abbott’s Direct Action scheme, which is at the centre of the recent climate redux by Scott Morrison – sets emissions “baselines”, or limits, for big polluters. The mechanism is supposed to ensure pollution cuts paid for through the taxpayer-funded emissions reduction fund – rebadged by Morrison last week as the “climate solutions fund” – are not undone by a blowout in emissions in other parts of the economy. The 2017 climate review signalled the mechanism would be loosened to ensure business did not face restraints on growth, with the changes to be implemented in the 2018-19 compliance year, in consultation with industry. The review said the mechanism needed to be “fairer and simpler” and it said changes were required to “address the risk of potential constraints on business growth raised by a number of stakeholders through the review”. The department has now circulated adjustments to the scheme which it says are “in line with the 2017 review of climate change policies”. One of the new proposals allows businesses to update baselines annually “for actual production where facilities use eligible production variables, so they continue to reflect facility circumstances” – which suggests baselines will be able to vary with production. Business sources have told Guardian Australia the proposal circulated by the Morrison government will put businesses in a situation where, in the short term, they are less likely to breach. But some point out the reboot could also be used by an incoming Labor government as the foundation for toughening the scheme if the opposition keeps the architecture as part of a new policy covering heavy emitters. The overhaul could provide the foundation for a cap and trade scheme, or an emissions intensity scheme, by, in essence, tidying up the mechanism before ratcheting down the baselines. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has flagged “some kind of emissions trading scheme” for liable entities – big polluters emitting more than 25,000 tonnes of carbon a year. Guardian Australia reported last March 16 Australian industrial sites had breached the government-imposed greenhouse gas emissions limits, which forced them to buy millions of dollars in carbon credits. Nearly 60 Australian industrial sites have previously been given the green light to increase pollution under the scheme, which is widely regarded as inadequate. Emissions have been rising since the Coalition repealed the carbon price and replaced it with the Direct Action scheme. Bandt said the Greens would explore ways to stop the changes from proceeding once parliament resumes for the budget session, and he declared Labor needed to take a clear stand on the issue. Bandt said Labor, if it wins the election in May, “need to change the rules to reduce pollution, not encourage it.” Tim Baxter from the Australian-German Climate and Energy College and Melbourne Law School said the overhaul meant the safeguard mechanism was now “totally useless”. “As small as the penalties were in the first year of the safeguard mechanism, and they were tiny for companies as large as those covered by the safeguard mechanism, this reform seems to be designed to ensure penalties never happen again,” Baxter said. “By moving to baselines that vary with production, it becomes more and more difficult for facilities to breach their limits”. “The safeguard mechanism moves from being next to useless in providing for a safe climate, to being totally useless”. “Under the previous default rules, while there was nothing compelling emissions to come down, there was at least a limit on their growth. Under the revised rules, there is neither”."
"I draw three circles on the board as my class watches. “So, what might this gas be?” “CO2” “Good, but what does CO2 stand for?” “Oh, carbon dioxide,” reels off the whole class as one. Secondary students know CO2. The chemical formula rolls off the tongues of even those who disdain science. Carbon dioxide is frequently mentioned in lessons; as products in reactions, during tests for gases, in the carbon cycle, respiration, photosynthesis and even to explain the greenhouse effect. This common gas, essential for many processes occurring on our planet, is intertwined throughout the secondary school curriculum. But real insight into the impact those two atoms of oxygen and one of carbon will have on my students’ future varies drastically between individuals. I have been following the growing student strikes around the world with fascination. Seeing young people abandon their studies for a day and claim to be taking their future into their own hands should make any teacher uneasy, and it has led me to question my role as a secondary school science teacher. I am sure most would agree with me that the purpose of a student’s school years is to safeguard their future; preparing them and educating them with information relevant to their future overall life happiness. The Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change and other global institutions have issued irrefutable warnings on global warming – now the education sector must ask itself how it can prepare young people for the battle against climate change. In response to the recent protests, a government official told the Guardian that “children are very engaged, otherwise they would not be joining protests” and that this “shows they are obviously being taught quite well”. Well, those students taking part in the protests were engaged, but very few of my pupils knew it was even happening or understood why the protesters were so upset. Are schools failing to fulfil a potential duty to inform their students about the situation? The newly updated KS4 science curriculum shows promise. In physics, students learn about renewable and non-renewable energy sources; in chemistry they study the carbon cycle and greenhouse effect; in biology they learn about biodiversity loss and methods of conservation. Exam questions ask about the consequences of global warming and directly link it to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being released excessively into the atmosphere. What is missing, however, is a way of bringing it all together; to show how the situation is likely to affect young people’s lives within a few years. Projections of societal collapse, famine and war are not fearmongering: they must be taken seriously. It is never enjoyable to startle and worry children, but we have a duty to inform them of the issues. We need more detail in the GCSE science curriculum, especially in terms of how renewable energy sources work, and I would like to see more information and debate about the consequences of not lowering carbon dioxide emissions or not rapidly acting to protect biodiversity. The PSHE (personal, social, health and economic) education syllabus taught at schools has the potential to be expanded. A good PSHE programme should promote children’s personal and economic wellbeing and help them develop as individuals. Part of this should be to prepare them for the high-carbon legacy from previous generations. Schools encourage charity fundraising and working within local communities. There now needs to be legislation to ensure they show the same diligence in protecting the planet’s future and preparing young people to be informed actors in their own futures. The big revolutions of the young against the old in the past century, like the swinging 60s, were characterised by the introduction of new social values. But this burgeoning 21st-century revolt doesn’t have to be a revolution at all. Young or old, no one wants to lose key species of plants and animals. No one wants to be short of food or see their children displaced or harmed due to conflict from limited resources. Some informed students of this country are simply prompting all adults, especially policy makers, to act on an issue which they ought already to be acting upon. We should stand in solidarity with them. • Edmund Stubbs is a secondary school science teacher based in east London"
"TV weather forecasters usually steer clear of mentioning climate change, perhaps fearing a backlash for straying on to controversial territory. But a recent experiment in the US suggests a dose of climate change news with the weather forecast is no bad thing.  Seventy per cent of Americans think climate change is a distant risk, and 40% believe it will not have any impact on them. Yet its effects are increasingly being felt close to home, with wildfires in California, a “snow drought” in the Pacific Northwest and the recent spell of extreme winter weather across much of the country. Can TV weather forecasters help undo some of the misconceptions? To answer this, scientists at George Mason University in Virginia analysed viewers’ reactions to weather forecasters explaining local climate change. More than two-thirds of viewers were interested, and even climate change deniers failed to be irritated or angered by the coverage. Previous research has shown that people are more receptive to pro-climate policies when they realise climate change is happening to them. Weather forecasters are trusted communicators and could play a powerful role in shifting public opinion."
"Generational politics is bullshit, but a Gen X guy would say that. I sometimes wonder, though, whether whatever is distinctive in my generation’s experience (and haunting our minds) might have something to offer the future. After a brief flurry of interest in the 1990s, thinkpieces on my demographic quickly waned. There were never that many of us; the meat in the sandwich was and is meagre.  Tired of their younger cousins and brothers, around the turn of the century, boomer pundits pivoted to an obsession with their millennial children. Those children stared back at them with mostly well-founded resentment. Both sides continue to have this out, ad nauseam. This oedipal struggle has tended to crowd us out; as the New Yorker writer Emily Nussbaum pointed out, Generation X is now sometimes forgotten altogether in articles pondering generational difference. In a tweet Nussbaum called our generation “gloomy, curmudgeonly ghosts”. By trying to relieve the gloom with a self-deprecating wisecrack, she exemplified another generational tic. This relative invisibility has had many consequences. One is that, while the economic plight of millennials has been considered at length, the difficulties of Generation X, which in some ways paralleled or even prefigured them, have received less attention. My sliver of Generation X (I’m 45) exited high school into the early 1990s recession. The oldest Xers did the same a decade earlier. On the way to Brisbane for university back then, I remember that each provincial Queensland town I passed through looked like a bomb had hit it. After a brief moment where the same towns were full of jet skis and new utes, post-boom, post-flood, many have now returned to their former state. This was formative: I for one never expected to find a real job. (Outside a few brief stretches, this expectation has been met). Although Generation X were the last to taste the fruits of postwar, middle-class stability in advanced economies, they were also the first to see major elements of it snatched away – especially in Australia. In Australia, after 1989, we didn’t receive a free higher education as many baby boomers did (I still have student debt). We were the first whose adult lives unfolded entirely under the cold skies of a “reformed” neoliberal economy, with weakened worker power and radically diminished job security (not to mention social security). We were the first not to exceed their parents in terms of many markers of wealth and success. We have also had to wait longest for the boomers to leave the stage. Way back in 1997, Mark Davis’s Gangland spelled out the stranglehold that baby boomers retained on Australian cultural life. Sadly, while the book expressed the feelings of a generation, it didn’t change much. Even now, many of the commanding heights of the culture are still in the possession of a generation that refuses to retire, despite Gen Xers entering what would ordinarily be understood as their late career. As was pointed out in a recent episode of US-based The Nostalgia Trap podcast, those early economic travails may be what gives so much of the youth culture of the 1990s – the only decade that Generation X can really call its own – a distinctive, depressive quality. Grunge – both the Seattle-born musical genre and the short-lived Australian literary movement – aestheticised the conditions of unemployed dirtbaggery that the 1990s forced upon us. Praise, the ur-grunge-lit novel by recently deceased Brisbane writer Andrew McGahan, blankly told the story of Gordon, a man who lives in a boarding house, and drifted drunk and aimless through his life. Gordon can’t be described as a failure because there’s little indication that he’s really trying. To the extent that Generation X received much attention, it was during this period: the time when we — and our designated generational representatives — were declaring ourselves creeps, losers, slackers. It may have displaced analysis away from the structural causes of our failure to economically thrive, but there are worse coping strategies. Other more militant expressions of disenfranchisement that were not simply generational appeared in hip-hop. NWA’s records anticipated the grimness of much of the alt-rock boom but transmitted the devastated post-Reagan social landscape of the United States much more vividly. Hip-hop was also more specifically targeted for censorship in the wake of the Los Angeles riots. During the 1990s Australia’s pop culture institutions, such as Triple J mostly shut out hip-hop altogether. The achievement in all of this cultural expression was to take seriously the idea that there may be no golden future. Some of it questioned the idea that there may be any future at all. Unfortunately (for some of us at least) a future has after all arrived. According to most definitions that offer precise generational boundaries, Generation X are those born between the mid-1960s and the late 1970s. (Boomers and millennials even get to inhabit larger slices of time, with two decades apiece). This means that, as of 2019, the entire generational cohort has entered the broadly recognised parameters of middle age; the oldest Gen-Xers are now in their mid-50s, and some now eligible to cash in whatever superannuation they might have managed to accumulate. The next stop is old age. What will we do with it? Many boomers have failed the test of ageing gracefully. That generation’s youth has endlessly been replayed to the rest of us as a moment of near-revolutionary exuberance (in his book Generation X, Douglas Coupland identified the mandatory veneration of the 1960s as “legislated nostalgia”). But now, some boomers have hardened; too many are shouty Facebook uncles or Nimby aunts. Not all boomers are reactionary, or economically privileged, of course. But disproportionately it is boomers – especially white boomers – who elected their generational counterpart Donald Trump president of the United States. Also, boomers disproportionately voted in favour of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. Given its more cramped and gloomy formative years, can Generation X age more gracefully? Once again, the answer may come in the midst of circumstances we would not have chosen, given the chance. The tests ahead are sterner than those that any generation has faced in some time. Generation X will grow to old age in a world which (it seems inevitable now) will be ravaged by the effects of climate change. We may be the last to grow old in anything resembling a stable form of modern civilisation. The stresses currently warping politics in liberal democracies are set to become worse. There will be more refugees as a result of climate change, and the refugee crisis may hit even closer to home: parts of Australia and the American south-west will be effectively uninhabitable. Some places are almost there already. Our economies are likely to be irreparably damaged as cities and towns are repeatedly pounded by storms, wildfires and floods. We may not be able to grow enough food — we may even have trouble pollinating some food plants due to the decline of insects. As resource constraints increase, so will conflicts over them. Wars of all kinds – civil, global – will be more likely in a world turning upside down. A new book by David Wallace-Wells, The Uninhabitable Earth, spells out all of the likely consequences in detail. The boomers can take comfort in the fact that most of them will be dead before the worst of this arrives from the middle of the century. Generation X will likely face dire crises in what may otherwise have been its golden years. Those of us with children have even more to worry about. When we understood, early, that we may not do as well as our parents did, we didn’t know the half of it. To the extent that the world looks to the old for wisdom, we will be in the hot seat. What will we do? What advice can we give? We may be better prepared for it than we imagine. For one, some of us have been hearing about climate change since we were schoolchildren. We are far less likely to deny the realities of what is happening than our predecessors. (Research in the US suggests an age gap on climate change – only 31% of 65+ Americans in 2015 believed it was happening due to human activity, whereas majorities did in all age groups under 50). So we may be more prepared to recommend or support radical solutions in a way that our complacent elders have not. We also have a radical political history of our own, which the culture has not memorialised, which too many of us have forgotten, and which we may be able to draw on. In 1992, LA erupted in response to police violence. Throughout the 1990s, the pioneers of third-wave and intersectional feminism challenged all expressions of misogyny, patriarchy and homophobia. If the boomers had the abortive revolution of 1968, we had 1999 and 2000. In Seattle, at Woomera and in Melbourne, an anti-authoritarian, leftwing protest politics was enacted which was unconnected to authoritarian state socialism, and had nothing to do with the cold war. On its own terms, much of it found short-term success – the police were outwitted in the Battle of Seattle by technology-enhanced protesters; the Woomera protests contributed to the centre’s closure, although the policy of immigration detention remains in place and is harsher than ever. This protest wave was interrupted by 9/11, the so-called war on terror, and the subsequent ramping up of security states around the world. There will be plenty of authoritarian solutions preferred for what’s coming down the pike. Eco-fascism is on the march; its solution to the climate crisis is genocide. “Normal” conservatives will seek to build walls and detain or refoul the desperate, and if recent history is any guide, the centre-left will dutifully maintain them. The radical left, too, has succumbed to the temptation of authoritarianism in the past in the face of perceived disorder and subversion. As the last who remember the cold war, who were adults as the war on terrorism began, it is up to us to remind people why they must resist such solutions. It is up to us to preserve, as long as we can, the memory of what flourished in the gaps during the 1990s as the world transitioned from one system to another. The flipside of the irony and gloom that characterised Generation X culture may be, if we can maintain it, a kind of pragmatic resilience. We have survived. Any future that may be left to us is a bonus. We were never really in charge anyway, so let’s keep rolling with the punches. Most importantly we must, as we age, know when to exhibit what may be our best trait, and a skill that the boomers never mastered. We must remember when to fade into the background, when to let others say their piece. We should endeavour to become, where circumstances require it, like ghosts. • Jason Wilson is a Guardian writer and columnist"

"More than 100 teachers, academics and students have blocked traffic and staged mock climate classes outside the Department for Education in a protest against the underplaying of environmental problems in the national curriculum. The demonstrators – who carried Teach the Truth, Rebel for Life and Climate: More Important Than Brexit banners – urged the government to make the climate and ecological crisis an educational priority. The protest organised by the Extinction Rebellion group, which has been taking place during the half-term holiday, was also a show of solidarity for 10,000 pupils who missed classes last Friday to express their frustration at the world’s failure to reduce emissions, inspired by 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who staged the first school strike. The organiser, Tim Jones, a secondary school teacher from Lewisham in south-east London, told the gathering that the education system was failing to address the complex reality of climate change and biodiversity loss. He said: “The current system teaches children to conform, not to question things. This conformity breeds the denial that is exacerbating the problems. What we need now is action. That’s what we have seen from children and students and that is now what we need from adults.” The protesters met at Old Palace Yard in Westminster and marched to the DfE offices on Great Smith Street. They blocked the road and heard speeches from Prof David Humphreys of the Open University, Dr Anne Andrews of the University of Cambridge and Dr Alison Green, a former pro vice-chancellor of Arden University who recently organised a letter signed by more than 200 academics in support of the Youth 4 Climate Strike. The teachers and students performed a pantomime lesson, with mock chairs and desk, and heaps of chalk, to highlight the curriculum’s light coverage of a topic that will shape the lives of young people. The protesters claimed the UK government had failed to live up to the Paris agreement in which it pledged to enhance education on climate change. They said climate change was treated, at best, as a peripheral subject and that the weak emphasis on the topic meant some state students could go through all 11 years of compulsory education with just 10 classes on climate change out of a total of more than 10,000. “Sometimes I wonder, what’s the point of teaching when no one is teaching the truth about the future?” said Andrew Thompson, a 33-year-old teacher. Green said she was speaking on behalf of fellow academics in expressing solidarity with the student strikers. “Like them, I fear for the future of the planet,” she said. “Young people are striving at school to gain qualifications to fulfil personal goals and aspirations. They trust the government but the government is letting them down and squandering their future.” The DfE said climate change was included in the curriculum. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, has criticised the young strikers. He said: “Missing class won’t do a thing to help the environment; all they will do is create extra work for teachers.” Many were inspired by students. Edmund Stubbs, a secondary school science teacher based in east London, wrote in the Guardian: “Seeing young people abandon their studies for a day and claim to be taking their future into their own hands should make any teacher uneasy and it has led me to question my role as a secondary school science teacher.” The demonstration is the latest in a wave of climate protests that are disrupting an increasingly wide range of locations and institutions. On Monday, dozens of Extinction Rebellion activists held up traffic outside a London fashion event. In December, the BBC’s central London headquarters was put on lockdown after campaigners rallied outside to demand the national broadcaster declare a “climate and ecological emergency”. More than 100 Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested in November when protesters blocked five London bridges and glued themselves to the doors of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. There have also been demonstrations outside the Scottish parliament and in the centre of Manchester. Extinction Rebellion, which started in the UK less than a year ago, now has groups in dozens of countries and plans to stage a week of disruption from 15 April."
"At first pass, there seems little amiss in the idyll of Florida Bay. A wedge-shaped expanse of water between the Everglades and the Florida Keys, it is a clean, sun-dappled 1,000 sq mile playground for reddening tourists, grizzled fishermen and loud-shirted locals. But the consequences of Florida’s century-long attempt to bend the environment to its will aren’t hard to find. Starved of fresh water from a reworking of its natural plumbing further north and menaced by seas rising due to climate change, the Everglades and its adjoining bay are teetering at the edge of existential crisis.  “The patient is on life support at the moment,” said Steve Davis, senior ecologist at conservation not-for-profit Everglades Foundation, describing what was once a prime fishing area in the western portion of the bay. A severe slump in rainfall in 2015 meant salinity levels rocketed in the bay, with the water becoming twice as salty in the ocean. This led to the die-off of seagrass, crucial for local marine life, leaving the water matted with deceased vegetation. The water here is shallow but still impenetrably murky, with the odd strand of seagrass floating by. Hurricane Irma tore up much of what remained last year, uprooting mangroves that had managed to survive the surging salt. “Notice how turbid and brown the water is,” Davis said, standing up on his skiff and peering into the bay. “This area, just last year smelled like death. It smelled like rotten eggs for almost three months.” Shark Bight, a cove found further north off the Everglades, is a prime birdwatching and fishing paradise turned “mud pit”, Davis said. Eddie Yarborough, a leathery fishing guide who has spent the last 25 years traversing the bay for trout, redfish and snook, likens the water to “chocolate milk”. Yarborough morosely added: “The water used to be so clear you could see the seagrass move back and forth. Now you can’t see the bottom. The dead water sort of moves around the bay and you think ‘I’ve just gotta get out of here.’” Decades of often poisonous politics have pushed the Everglades, one of the largest and perhaps best-known wetlands in the world, down the path of entropy and potential collapse. A sweeping plan to restore the Everglades was passed by Congress in 2000 and promptly stalled. Now less than half of its original size, the Everglades is beset by encroaching development and nutrient pollution and riddled with invasive species, such as the Burmese python, and exotic plants, such as Brazilian pepper and Australian pine. But conservationists have fresh hope in the unlikely corporeal form of Ron DeSantis, the new Republican governor of Florida who roused national attention with a campaign video that vowed his children’s fealty to Donald Trump and a televised debate where his opponent, Democrat Andrew Gillum, accused his supporters of racism. Since taking office in January, DeSantis has taken an unTrumpian approach to the environment, outlining a $2.5bn plan over four years to rescue the ailing Everglades. The plan would tackle local water pollution, protect springs and finish raising the Tamiami Trail, a highway that links Miami and Florida’s west coast by cutting across the Everglades, to allow water to flow south to the ecosystem. DeSantis has called for the resignations of the entire South Florida Water Management District board, which controls water policy for the region, and has appointed two members – Ron “Alligator Ron” Bergeron and Chauncey Goss – who both have strong green credentials. Florida has even thrown itself into a legal battle to halt a controversial oil drilling project in the north-eastern reaches of the Everglades. “Our water and natural resources are the foundation of our economy and our way of life in Florida,” DeSantis said. “The protection of water resources is one of the most pressing issues facing our state.” Environmentalists have been cheered by the contrast from the previous governor, Rick Scott, who cut funding for environmental programs. DeSantis isn’t exactly a global warming warrior – he prefers “Teddy Roosevelt conservationist” – but he will at least utter the words “climate change”, unlike Scott, who reportedly banned the term. “It feels like more has happened in the past few months than in the past 25 years,” said Eric Eikenberg, the chief executive of the Everglades Foundation. The problems faced by the Everglades aren’t new or unexplored. Not long after developers started draining the wetlands for agriculture and paved it over for roads and houses, the effects started rippling through the system. By the 1960s, scientists had calculated that while around 2m acre feet (2.5bn cubic metres) of water once flowed in a shallow river of grass from central Florida to the state’s southern tip, the volume of this conveyor belt had been cut in half. The Everglades’ link to its headwater in Lake Okeechobee has been severed, with water diverted via canals for agriculture, particularly sugar. Without the nourishing freshwater, the ecosystem further south has become saltier and prone to disastrous events, such as happened in 2015, when pristine water turns into a muddy slush, causing fish to flee or die. The region is again in mild drought, meaning that rainwater isn’t currently coming to the Everglades’ salvation. “The problem is we’re just not getting enough water,” Davis said. “We only get about a third of the water in the eastern Florida Bay that we received historically. A national park, a world heritage site, an international biosphere reserve, and we’re starving it of fresh water.” One solution, Davis and other advocates believe, is to create a vast reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee that would store water intended for the Everglades. The water would filter south through a system of marshes to deliver millions of gallons of replenishment to the ecosystem. DeSantis backed the plan and recently penned a letter to Trump, alongside Florida senators Scott and Marco Rubio, to ask for funding. There is political expediency in altering the current scenario where the water in Lake Okeechobee is discharged to the west and east, via the Caloosahatchee and the St Lucie rivers respectively, when it fills up and threatens to overflow. Laden with chemicals from nearby agriculture and warmed in temperatures that are climbing as the climate heats up, the water is the perfect spawning ground for toxic blue-green algal blooms. Separate “red tide” algal outbreaks in the ocean ravaged Florida last year, leading to beaches being closed, horrified dog owners who saw their pets poisoned, and hundreds of tons of dead fish and manatees piling up along the Gulf coast. The tourism industry, worth about $67bn annually to Florida, trembled. The breakdown of the natural chain of life was so starkly apparent to Floridians that it became a battleground in the midterm elections. “Voters got hyped up about red tide and said ‘we want the government to act,’” said Rene Price, an expert in the hydrology of the Everglades at Florida International University. “There was a large outcry and it seems like we have got some momentum now.” The Everglades faces the threat of salty inundation on all sides, with the sea level at its edge rising by about 5in since 2001. Price said this accelerating climate trend, driven by the melting of glaciers and expanding sea water, will see the Everglades retreat further north. There will be miles and miles of new Florida Bay. “But we shouldn’t be sitting on our hands,” Price said. “We have the capability to stem the tide by increasing the flow of fresh water. This isn’t the time to give up.” Oliver Milman traveled to the Everglades as a guest of the Everglades Foundation."
"The Coalition government has today released its climate policy for the upcoming election. Not much could have been expected from the government given that the prime minister has only been in the role six months, and not much was delivered.  There is not a lot of detail around the total package, the $3.5bn cash splash. What we have is enough to make clear that this is not the climate policy solution that the government thinks it is. The emissions reduction fund is a pool of money that the commonwealth government uses to buy “carbon abatement” from private parties around the country. This carbon abatement occurs when an organisation takes some action to avoid or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. For instance, a waste company could capture and burn off the methane from its landfills, or a farmer might draw greenhouses gases from out of the atmosphere, by planting trees. At present 26 different methods of abating our emissions are at play under government contracts. The current funding allocated to the scheme is $2.55bn. About $2.33bn of that money has been allocated to projects already over the ERF’s eight auctions. A little over $480 million has been paid to those running the projects so far. The government claims that the fund will provide 193 million tonnes of abatement between 2015 and 2028, an average of about 14 million tonnes per year. Those numbers may seem big, but that’s about one third of the emissions per year from Australia’s largest emitter, AGL. Among a suite of measures announced by the government on Monday was a $2bn boost to the emissions reduction fund, as well as a rebrand. The climate solutions fund will use the same mechanism as the emissions reduction fund and will spend $200m per year over the next 10 years to offset our emissions. If that funding arrives, and the average price stays the same as recent auctions, that mechanism will deliver approximately 90 million tonnes of abatement in the next decade, with a further 60 million tonnes being delivered after 2030. That’s a big if. While the government’s headline figure is $2bn, at most only $600m of that will be delivered in the next term of government. Ignoring the fact that there are many better and more legitimate ways to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions than by direct investment from the government, the ERF fails on its own terms through a series of bespoke issues across the methods. These have been reported over the past four years and provided a picture of a deeply flawed scheme. For example, research published by myself and a colleague at Melbourne Law School and reported in the Guardian found that most projects contracted under the ERF’s landfill gas method predate the scheme – some by more than a decade. The fund is supposed to drive new abatement. This is expressly in the goals of the scheme itself. The ERF provides little benefit to the environment by funding these old projects, and the funding is rapidly converted into shareholder dividends. The revegetation methods while generally robust will be dwarfed by land-clearing elsewhere in Australia. The ERF has secured commitments to deliver 111 million tonnes from revegetation projects across Australia over 2015-2028. Research out of ANU estimates that Australia’s recent land-clearing rates have been releasing up to 38 million tonnes per year. We wouldn’t need to invest this money at all if Australia could get its land-clearing under control. Another story on Monday revealed that major polluters such as the Granny Smith Gold Mine are being paid by the ERF to switch out one form of fossil fuelled power for another. This is occurring even though the proponents themselves indicated that the funding played no role in their decision to upgrade. Again, this runs counter to the express goals of the fund, which is supposed to drive new emissions abatement opportunities, rather than subsidise project activity that may have occurred anyway. These problems have pervaded the ERF and will continue into the new climate solutions fund. Australia is blessed with opportunity when it comes to dealing with climate change. We are the sunniest and windiest inhabited continent in the world, with ample opportunities to build our renewables as well as the necessary infrastructure to support them (such as batteries). We have incredible potential to reduce our emissions across the country, with analysis released last year from Reputex showing that even Labor’s higher goal of -45% below 2005 levels by 2030 can be reduced on a cost negative basis. We need to do so much more than accounting tricks and the direct purchase of spurious abatement. The IPCC’s special report on a 1.5-degree target, released last year made it clear that to have a moderately safe climate, things will be far easier if we start now. The precipitous declines in our emissions that will be needed if we wait until after 2030 are something that I struggle to believe possible. But if we start now, a relatively safe climate future is achievable. Despite the hyperbole thrown around in certain sectors of the media, and by certain politicians, it is not economy-wrecking, too hard, or not worth it. More importantly, it is entirely necessary. The world where we choose not to act to prevent the worst of climate change is not looking great. • Tim Baxter is an associate of the Australian-German Climate and Energy College and a fellow of Melbourne Law School"
"The adder, Britain’s only venomous snake, has for the first time been confirmed as being active in every month of the year. Adders normally hibernate underground from October to March, a strategy designed to enable them to survive a cold winter, but with warmer weather have now been seen throughout the year.  They are declining as a result of increasing habitat loss, persecution, predation, disturbance and inbreeding. A shorter hibernation period and becoming more active in winter is likely to accelerate their demise, as snakes will be much more susceptible to any cold weather that follows a warm spell. Following the record warm temperatures in February, adders have been seen in every calendar month. While the adder is well adapted to cold weather, occurring further north in the world than any other snake species, this is new behaviour and experts warn it is a clear sign of the impact climate change is having on wildlife. Nigel Hand, a trustee of Amphibian and Reptile Groups of the UK and one of the country’s leading adder experts, confirmed the trend.  “I’ve seen adders in every month of the year except December, but have had reliable reports of them being active then in Wales,” he said. “Adders have already been recorded as being seen throughout the year in a national park in the Netherlands, so I have no doubt they are now active throughout the year in Britain as well.” The recent unprecedented temperatures have resulted in adders emerging from hibernation up to a month early. Being active in winter brings them into greater contact with humans and dogs, leading to increased disturbance at their hibernation sites at a time when they are particularly vulnerable because they are sluggish and bask in the open. Adders are protected by law and are shy reptiles that will always try to escape unless cornered or molested. Although they are venomous, no one has died from an adder bite in Britain in more than 40 years and conservationists have in recent years tried to tackle the reptiles’ “image problem”. However, dogs off leads will often attack adders and there have already been reports this year of adders biting dogs in the New Forest. As a result the TV presenter Chris Packham, who lives in the area, has called for dogs to be banned from nature reserves in the People’s Manifesto for Wildlife he launched last year. The adder used to be widespread across Britain but has declined markedly in recent years, particularly in middle England. Research published in the Herpetological Journal has warned that at current rates of decline, the adder could be restricted to just a few sites in the UK within 10-20 years. "
"Gas hobs or boilers should be banned from being installed in new homes within the next six years, government advisers have recommended. A report by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says that from 2025 at the latest, no new homes should be connected to the gas grid – with super-efficient houses and flats heated using low-carbon energy instead.  It also warns that UK homes are not fit for the future, with efforts to cut greenhouse gases from housing stalling and properties at growing risk of overheating and flooding. The committee called on the government to get serious about tackling emissions from homes and ensuring they are adapted to cope with a future of more extreme weather. The way new homes are built and existing properties are “retrofitted” with energy efficiency measures often falls short of stated design standards, deceiving householders and inflicting costs on the future, the committee said. Closing the “performance gap” between design standards and what is achieved could save those in new homes between £70 and £260 a year on their energy bills, the report said. Cash-strapped councils need better funding to help enforce building standards and there should be stiffer penalties for non-compliance, it said. The Treasury should support, as a “major infrastructure priority”, measures in existing homes to install low-carbon heating such as heat pumps, loft and wall insulation, and protection for properties at risk of flooding. Support is also needed to train designers, builders and installers of climate-friendly technology to address the low-carbon skills gap and create green jobs. Baroness Brown, the chair of the CCC’s adaptation subcommittee, said: “There are almost 30m homes in the UK, and the depressing fact is most of them are not in a condition to keep us comfortable and productive and well as the climate changes. “They are a huge part of the problem – energy use in our homes is around a fifth of greenhouse gases, and the biggest part of those emissions is from burning gas for heating and hot water.” A government committed to meeting climate targets, which require net zero emissions to curb rising temperatures, “has to get serious about this” she said. Brown suggested the government should be demanding much higher standards through measures to encourage building 300,000 new homes a year. “We shouldn’t be allowing 300,000 substandard homes that will need upgrading to be built, they should be built to the right standard now,” she said. “We could tell house builders who are making a lot of money from help to buy that it’s only available for homes of a really high quality.” A government spokesman said it would carefully consider the recommendations, adding: “The UK has reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation, and moving to a greener, cleaner economy while continuing to grow the economy is at the heart of our modern industrial strategy. “Over the next 10 years, we have committed to drive £6bn to improve the energy efficiency of lower income and vulnerable households.”"
"You may have noticed that Scott Morrison has started talking about climate – he has rebadged and refunded Tony Abbott’s Direct Action emissions reduction fund and Malcolm Turnbull’s Snowy Hydro 2.0. The Coalition’s pivots on climate echo research that centrist voters are starting to draw lines between environmental issues such as climate change, energy, clean air and water, food security and waste with capacity for leadership.  So three months out from an election, independents are emerging to challenge Coalition MPs, taking a bet that centre-right voters want action on these issues that are normally associated with the centre left. If your attention is on the big cities, you may have missed some interesting candidates step out of the shrubbery in rural and regional seats in the past week. Three independents have announced challenges to Barnaby Joyce, Angus Taylor and Sussan Ley at the federal election. While these would-be crossbenchers are not national household names, they are locally connected and will test the ideas, electorate voting cultures and resources of sitting MPs. Political disengagement, climate, water and regional services rate highly on their platforms though each have local nuance which is so important in such seats. Joyce will face a challenge from rural sustainability strategist and small businessman Adam Blakester, who comes from Werris Creek, the same place as the seat’s former independent Tony Windsor. Joyce holds the seat on a margin of 23%, following the 2017 byelection over his dual citizenship. The contest will test Joyce’s standing following the fallout from his affair (not public prior to the byelection), but more particularly, his record as agriculture minister on issues such as live export and water management. Blakester has been organising for four months. Like Cathy McGowan’s “kitchen table conversations”, he says he will consult with locals to construct a policy platform, but climate change and sustainability is already trending in his conversations. But his non-negotiable priority is proper political and public governance: how politicians interact on the floor of parliament, with the media, with each other and flowing from that, an effective anti-corruption commission. “I think there is real discontent across Australia and here in New England – I hear it’s like a school yard but as someone who has done a lot of work with schools, I wouldn’t use children as a metaphor, I wouldn’t use dogs; we need a new metaphor,” Blakester said. “Some of their behaviour makes Taiwan’s parliament look good.” Closer to Sydney, an adventurer, environmentalist and small businessman who was named by Time magazine as one of 25 “worldwide responsibility pioneers” will challenge energy minister Angus Taylor in Hume. Huw Kingston won the Time title after he campaigned successfully to stop the sale of still bottled water in his hometown of Bundanoon. He needs to beat a 1o% margin in Hume which is a tricky seat that stretches from the outskirts of Sydney through the southern highlands and down to farming country near Canberra. Kingston is more overt than Blakester about his pledge to campaign on climate change and specifically a renewable energy target of 60% by 2035 – compared with the Coalition’s abandoned target and Labor’s 50% target by 2030. He wants to see a federal royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin, a national policy to phase out single-use plastics, no new large-scale coalmines including Adani, an increase in the current annual refugee intake from 20,000 to 30,000, closure of Manus Island and Nauru detention centres, a very fast train link between Sydney and Canberra, and better regional health and education services. Malcolm Turnbull’s demise got Kingston thinking about politics at a time when more reports were issued about the state of the climate. It was a “now or never” proposition. “The story getting common for those standing and for the people out in Australia is how disappointed they are with political system over last 10 years, but it was the rolling of Turnbull in August that fired me up,” Kingston said. “I was pissed off as a taxpayer. What other job could you do where you would be allowed to stay and do a job while destabilising inside the workplace? “Politicians have been playing games instead of governing and it is all going on while the world continues to warm up and no one is doing anything about it.” Different again is ex-policeman and Albury mayor Kevin Mack who is challenging Sussan Ley in the 127,000sq km seat of Farrer. Mack is more old-style country politician, reflecting the nature of his seat. He presents as a mix of Labor and Liberal strands. Mack admires Paul Keating’s intellect in driving the agenda of the Hawke government, but says the National’s Doug Anthony was the last major party representative with “a decent regional focus”. Mack says he is focused on the whole seat, the small towns that add ballast and productivity to the larger centres such as Albury and Griffith. Water is a big issue in the electorate, including its quality and the productivity derived from water. But he also names regional services as a concern. “Connectivity, transport, NBN, mobile phone towers are nonexistent in Farrer,” he says. “We have 22% unemployment, which is a significant problem. If you fix water, you fix employment. And investing in mental health from the front end rather than the back end.” Mack has connected with nearby independent candidates, including Helen Haines who is hoping to replace McGowan in Indi, and Ray Kingston, the former Yarriambiack mayor hoping to win the safe seat Mallee after the unexpected retirement of the National Andrew Broad. It is these conversations that are changing things on the ground in rural electorates. That, combined with candidates who are more confident to challenge the notions of what a rural voter is and the policies that voters may support."

"In 1975, photographer Michel Comte stood up before scientists, business leaders and politicians at the Club of Rome to deliver a speech about the climate disaster he believed was on the horizon. Back then, he was still a student, and a little nervous – but he could sense the future. Now, Comte’s recent works incorporating black carbon fallout from the jet stream, shown in Rome, Milan and Hong Kong, prove just how right he was to speak out. Comte’s message was echoed last week in the UK, when thousands of schoolchildren – inspired by 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg – took to the streets to pressure the government into taking action on climate change. Like Comte, they have seen a bleak future ahead and are speaking out.  Sadly, that hasn’t been the case for most artistic and cultural institutions, which have spent the last few decades responding to climate change with little more than silence. They have been dangerously complicit in desensitising society to what’s really at stake. It hasn’t always been this way. In the mid-90s, when a post-Chernobyl generation made its voice heard, the ecological protest movement was nurtured by critical theatre, radical art shows, public debate and avant garde music. Then something changed. In response to the backlash against fossil fuels, major energy suppliers became involved with arts sponsorship. This was no harmless philanthropy. Parallel to the rise of the blockbuster exhibition the importance of Shell and BP to the artistic budget of arts centres grew, to a point where many major national institutions were on the payroll of the fossil fuel giants. Some still are today. But even for those who have freed themselves of it (or exchanged them for carmakers), the damage to a generation has been done. For decades arts institutions have effectively engaged in self-censorship to pay for their productions, putting on amazing programming and covering critical topics, as long as it wasn’t a thorough debate of our addiction to fossil fuels. This strategic exclusion of a topic from public debate over more than a generation has led to ignorance, with repercussions in education, academic and public life. But there is hope in the air. Tate Modern have an Olafur Eliasson retrospective scheduled for this summer – his Ice Watch project was recently invited to melt away outside the museum, with the carbon impact of each block accounted for. As for Comte, he is about to board a sailing boat for a challenging passage to the Arctic, creating a monumental light installation calling for us to change our ways before it’s too late. If we allow more artists such as these to become part of the conversation, we will have a culture fit for the generation of children who took to our streets. Nuclear fallout, rising sea levels and … nail clippingsWhen artist Yi Dai opened her first solo show in Berlin, she received rapturous reviews praising her subtle and intelligent coverage of environmental topics. Misfits, Offcuts and Castaways, in 2016, was an urgent statement reflecting on the aftereffects of nuclear fallout and rising sea temperatures, and the fragility of our ecosystem. Her exhibition was as much a personal account of her experience on the Marshall Islands as it was a call to action following the then-warmest winter in recorded history. Her show, Discarded… During My 20s (at House of Egorn in Berlin until 23 February), explores the subject of the human body: the artist juxtaposes bodily remains – hair, nail clippings, blood – with construction materials such as steel, concrete and glass that surround, contain, or reflect our bodies. Sailing to the Arctic for a climate vigilWavelength Foundation was formed on a sailing boat in late 2017 by an international group of journalists, writers, environmentalists, cultural workers, artists and scientists. One of the foundation’s fundamental principles is that a rich and meaningful cultural engagement with nature is needed to readjust their lost relationship. Comte will soon set sail to the Arctic with the foundation for his large-scale 3D-mapping light installation Black Light, inviting sailors from around the globe to join his monumental climate vigil. Meanwhile, the foundation’s Change Maker scheme is helping to build a sustainable arts and culture centre in South America, to bring the opportunities of a circular economy to the lives of children and younger people looking to escape the cycle of poverty. Remembering Earth before the cataclysmsParis-based artist Nadine Rotem-Stibbe explores environmental issues with a keen eye for design. Her installation In Loving Memory, 2018, 0.8°C, a collaboration with Ryan Cherewaty, can be found at an abandoned building site at the Ebbingekwartier of Groningen, the Netherlands. It takes a part mocking, part melancholic view of our time, looking back from a fictitious (yet by no means unrealistic) future in which a large cache of archaeological objects has been uncovered in the Trans-European floodplain. The artefacts offer an unprecedented look into human life in 2018, prior to the great cataclysms that struck. There is a profound obsession with objects created from the industrial processing of complex carbon-chain polymers – plastics – an industry that was a key factor in heavily increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These objects seem to have survived extreme climate changes and offer a glimpse into our perplexing culture.  The art school on the edge of the worldPerched on the shore of a sea loch and overlooking the Minch and the hills of Harris and Skye, Lews Castle College in the Outer Hebrides has been referred to as the “art school on the edge of the world.” Sustainability is a key element to the teaching, with students responding to the environment and the unique wilderness of the unusual location. The college hosts talks from practitioners across a range of areas, from marine biologists and archaeologists to traditional makers working with natural materials. Part of the college building is the site of a recently commissioned light installation by Finnish artists Timo Aho and Pekka Niittyvirta, which interacts with the tidal changes, activating on high tide. The work provides a visual reference of future sea level rises and explores the catastrophic long-term impact of our relationship with nature. Mountain biking through our tumultuous weatherTales of Change brings together stories of how climate change is impacting communities in some of the planet’s most iconic mountain ranges. Its protagonist, Florian Reber, cycled across the Alps, starting in Trieste on the Adriatic coast and arriving in Cannes, at the Mediterranean Sea. Along the way, he talked with farmers, foresters, conservationists, tourism experts, alpinists and professional athletes, psychologists, writers and journalists about climate change. Periods of tumultuous weather extremes are the consistent findings, including a pronounced drought that left many rivers and sources in the southern Dolomites dried out. This was followed by the strongest föhn storms in recent years, causing record temperatures in October 2018. Next came torrential rain and strong winds brought about by cyclone Vaia, uprooting thousands of trees and causing casualties. While this trip involved cycling 1,180 miles, climbing more than 35,000 vertical metres and mastering two dozen mountain passes in winter, the intrepid explorer is now getting ready to widen his reach towardsthe Rocky Mountains and Himalayas. The project has been on display in Switzerland and Italy but, like Reber, is constantly moving.  Solar robots transforming snow back into glaciersHoused in Barcelona’s magnificent historical pavilion Sant Cosme y Sant Damià, Quo Artis is an international non-profit organisation dedicated to advancing the dialogue between arts, science and technology. Recent activity includes Glaciator, an art installation in Antarctica composed of solar robots that help to compact and crystallise the snow by turning it into ice, then adhering it to the glacier mass. As glacial melting is one of the most alarming effects of global warming, the mission of these robots is to accelerate the ice formation process, allowing glaciers to regain the mass they have lost as a result of the thaw.  The old furniture factory where ‘waste is a failure of the imagination’This 1930s furniture factory, in southern Sweden, is being turned into one of the most exciting places for interdisciplinary research and innovation in sustainability. The brainchild of former gallerist David Risley, the hub brings culture together with science, philosophy, free thinking and business, and is scheduled to open in summer 2020. With more than 12,000 square metres of open-plan space set over several floors, Funkisfabriken could become a test bed for new sustainable approaches. “Waste is a failure of imagination,” reads its founding slogan. Located a short walk from the botanist Carl Linnaeus’s house and garden, the space will feature an array of labs (wet, dry, clean and dirty), an urban farm, a circular economy centre, and conference facility, exhibition spaces and sculpture parks – not to mention a hotel, indoor garden and a zero-waste restaurant set up by Doug McMaster of the Brighton restaurant Silo."
"Clare Farrell, co-founder of the environmental action group Extinction Rebellion, claimed she was barred from entering a show at London fashion week two days after helping to organise a protest against the British Fashion Council to highlight the industry’s role in fuelling climate change. About 150 people from Extinction Rebellion formed human roadblocks and brought traffic to a standstill outside event venues on Sunday to cause disruption and urge the industry body to declare a climate emergency.  Farrell, who is also a spokeswoman for the direct action group, said she was approached by a police officer who addressed her by name when she was in the queue for the Bethany Williams show at 180 The Strand, London, on Tuesday afternoon, and was told she was not allowed to enter.  “The police liaison officer said I could queue up but that the venue wouldn’t let me in,” Farrell said. “She referenced Extinction Rebellion and pointed to a badge I was wearing.” Farrell, a fashion designer, said that she had helped produce Williams’ line, which is dedicated to social justice and sustainability, and that she had not been intending to protest at the event. “To exclude a designer who was both involved in the production of the line and working to bring attention to the climate and ecological crises from the show is just unbelievable,” she added. The group said Farrell had a ticket for the show, and that staff at the venue were informed of her multiple roles in the production of Williams’ award-winning line. Williams was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II design award for her work, which addresses environmental issues, by the Duchess of Cornwall on Tuesday night. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: “On Tuesday 19 February, the organisers of a private event taking place on The Strand in central London took a decision not to admit a member of the public to their event. This decision was conveyed to the member of the public by a police officer at the scene.” On Sunday, the British Fashion Council said that it was “pleased that we live in a country where we have a right to protest peacefully”. It said in a statement: “We believe that more than any other capital, London has an opportunity to be a part of a cultural change around sustainable business practices that put creative product at their core. “This week we hope to both encourage the showcasing of these creative businesses whilst increasing the dialogue around mindful consumerism, one that we are raising ourselves through our Positive Fashion programme.” The British Fashion Council has been contacted for further comment."

"This week’s record winter heat in the UK was so far above normal trends that scientists have been forced to reconsider their statistical models, with one expert calling the temperature jump “incredible”. UK temperature records have tumbled in the past 10 days. Last Thursday, Scotland experienced its highest winter warmth of 18.3C in Aboyne, in Aberdeenshire. On Tuesday, Wales set a new UK high for the season for 20.8 in Porthmadog. This was beaten on Wednesday, when Kew registered 21.2C.  Even taking into account the underlying 1C of global heating from carbon emissions this was a surprise to some scientists. Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, a climate researcher at Royal Netherlands Meteorolgical Institute who has conducted a preliminary study of the trend data from Reading and central England, said the probability of this week’s temperatures was close to zero. “This is an incredible jump in record temperatures. If you asked me a few months ago, I would have said it is ridiculous,” he said. “It’s at least a one-in 200-year event, but it could be more because my statistical tools break down because this was so far outside what we are used to in February.” According to the Met Office, the mean maximum temperature in February was at up to 3.5C above the average between 1981 and 2010. This was due to large areas of high pressure over continental Europe that brought warm air from the Canaries and north Africa. Government meteorologists are now studying exactly how much of this unusual heat can be attributed to man-made climate change. Grahame Madge, a spokesman for the Met Office, said: “For a lot of people an opportunity to enjoy a nice day but for many others it was shocking to see values above 20C. Clearly having that warm weather record broken is, we think, largely to do with climate change, amplifying those warm events. That was widely recognised by the public.”  Previous Met Office studies show the man-made carbon emissions in the atmosphere made last summer’s heatwave 30 times more likely, and extremes of heat are now being recorded 10 times more often than extremes of cold. The weirding of the weather – which was warmer than Bermuda this week and colder than the Arctic at the same time last year – has prompted mixed reactions. A study of the coverage by CarbonBrief highlights how images of wildfires on Saddleworth Moor and stories about water shortages contrasted with cheery headlines such as “Fabruary” and reports about ice-cream sales. Nick Bridge, the UK’s chief climate envoy, was among many to express frustration with the lack of concern in many reports by the BBC and others: @BBCNews & @bbcfivelive also covered record temperatures, focusing on🍦sales, with no note of concern. Yet here I sit in deepest existential unease knowing what collectively these bonkers (diplomatic term) record-breaking weather events & trends across the world probably mean. https://t.co/e3krYDj39T Yet the first climate debate in parliament for two years was sparsely attended by MPs. The disparity between the growing evidence of crisis and the limp response by politicians and most media is expected to galvanise more direct action of the sort seen in recent months with student strikes and acts of civil disobedience by Extinction Rebellion protesters. “Thanks to the students, who made us act,” said Layla Moran‏, a Liberal Democrat MP who proposed the debate with Caroline Lucas of the Green party, and urged legislators to listen to the child activists. “The message that came to us from the young people, who struck the other day, is that we must now take this as an emergency. We cannot wait another two years to debate this in this place.” Lucas said time was running out but the government was going backwards on climate action. “Since 2010 almost every existing sensible climate measure has been torched: zero carbon homes scrapped, onshore wind effectively banned, solar power shafted, the Green Investment Bank flogged off, and fracking forced on local communities.” Claire Perry, the minister of state for energy and clean growth, accepted that current efforts were insufficient. “We can take pride in the UK’s record in tackling climate change, but we know we have to do more, and we will do more. We must keep leading from the front so we can look the next generation in the eye and say for your future we protected Planet A because there is no Planet B.” But the sparse turnout highlighted the low priority this continues to be for most politicians. Extinction Rebellion has shared images of the largely empty chamber on social networks and echoed Lucas’s call for the government to declare a climate emergency. It plans to support a global school strike on 15 March and to stage a week of disruption starting on 15 April. Other environment groups are also stepping up pressure on the government. “We’re living through a climate emergency, so really our politicians should be debating this every week,” said Mel Evans, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK. “It’s time for us all to demand that our government faces up to reality and calls the crisis what it is, a climate emergency.”"

"As bushfires raged across Tasmania, Victoria and New Zealand, and north Queensland faced a massive cleanup after unexpected flooding, a different extreme weather event was silently forming in the Tasman Sea over summer. For the second year in a row, a stubborn high-pressure system over the Tasman Sea was warming the surface of the ocean to above-average temperatures, forming a marine heatwave, wreaking destruction and providing a glimpse of the new ecological order in the marine Anthropocene. Globally marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and prolonged and affecting biodiversity, according to new research published in Nature Climate Change this week.  In the summer of 2017-18, the intense marine heatwave was combined with a land-based heatwave, together covering four million sq km. Scientists  found the extreme weather event caused unprecedented loss of glacial ice in the New Zealand Southern Alps, changes to wine-grape harvests, and major disruption of marine ecosystems including kelp habitat loss, new species invasions and fisheries season changes. This year the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand  reported that sea surface temperatures in the Tasman were again above average. Like coral reefs and tropical rainforests, the ocean suffers the slow torture of climate change peppered with high-intensity hits from extreme weather. Marine heatwaves are generally out of sight and out of mind until one gets so bad it becomes impossible to ignore, says CSIRO research scientist Alistair Hobday. A marine heatwave happens when the ocean temperature is much warmer than usual for the time of year from sunlight heating the surface water or warm water being brought via ocean currents – or both. Climate change is causing marine heatwaves to happen more frequently and with more intensity. There may not be scorched earth or destroyed homes left in its wake, but a marine heatwave impacts our future in different ways – and serves as a warning. “Marine heatwaves provide a window into what our oceans will look like in the future, which is why it’s important to keep track of them,” Hobday says. In 2015, New Zealand experienced its longest and most intense marine heatwave on record. For some it was good news – “It brought down valuable tropical species like kingfish and snapper,” Hobday says. For the aquaculture industry, however, it brought disease outbreaks in oyster farms, disruptions to salmon farming and abalone deaths along the coast. When an extreme marine heatwave lingered over the Shark Bay world heritage area in 2011, seagrass and kelp forests died en masse. Some kelp species became regionally extinct over hundreds of kilometres, says marine ecologist Cayne Layton from the University of Tasmania. “That [kelp loss] was a direct effect of the heat, but also due to herbivorous fish following the warm water and moving in to munch on the kelp.” Like coral, kelp provides habitat structure, shelter and food for an entire ecosystem – without it the ecosystem would cease to exist. But, also like coral, the planet is losing kelp forests to climate change at an alarming rate. Forests of giant kelp, known as Macrocystis pyrifera, used to dominate Tasmania’s coastline. But in recent years, 95% have been lost and largely replaced by common kelp, says Layton. “It’s the equivalent of losing a forest on land and having it replaced by shrubbery,” he says. “It might still have some diversity, but you’ve undoubtedly lost something important.”  Although common kelp might take over in the short term, a marine heatwave or a plague of hungry sea urchins could quickly knock that out too, allowing even hardier turf algae to move in. From the forest to the shrub, now to a lawn – albeit a weedy one. Species that, like kelp, can’t keep pace with the fast rate of anthropogenic warming, can be quickly be written off by an extreme event such as a marine heatwave or tropical cyclone.  Some more physically and physiologically nimble species are set to thrive in a warmer ocean. “[In a warmer ocean] you might expect to see more ‘weedy species’ that can adapt more quickly to change,” says marine ecologist Zoe Doubleday from the University of South Australia. Weedy isn’t a technical classification of plants or animals, but rather a type of lifestyle. Animals and plants considered weedy species typically have short lifespans and a flexible lifestyle that allows them to take advantage of sparse or patchy resources, Doubleday says. “They can change their shape, what they eat and when they mature and reproduce to take advantage of novel conditions created by climate change,” she says. “For example jellyfish, algae and cephalopods – they’re very different types of organisms, but they have some similar characteristics. They’re short-lived, tolerant, adaptable – just like a terrestrial weed that you might see in your garden.” Receding kelp forests are already being replaced by seaweed turfs, bigger numbers of some cephalopods and jellyfish blooms. “We already eat weedy species, and cephalopods are becoming increasingly important in our fisheries, and they might be better than fish in terms of sustainability in the future,” Doubleday says. “Rather than just suppressing the weeds, maybe we could start predicting exactly which species are going to thrive and how we could use them.” So while jellyfish may not be on the menu now, soon there may be few other options."
"At long last the political debate in the world’s richest country is vibrant with proposals that would help the most vulnerable in our society. And what do we hear in response? A growing chorus of naysayers. “Just pipe dreams” – that’s how the Washington Post columnist Robert Samuelson referred to proposals for guaranteed jobs, Medicare for All, universal childcare, and the Green New Deal.  Like many other pundits and politicians, Samuelson says we can’t afford such luxuries. Taxing the rich wouldn’t raise enough money. We’d have no choice but to resort to deficit spending. Funny how some politicians have no qualms about ballooning the deficit with tax cuts for the rich but balk at investing in the long-term health of our people and communities. Just as peculiar: the fact that military spending cuts are virtually never mentioned as an option for freeing up funds for social good instead of war. This year the US military budget is $716bn – and boy is it ripe for slashing. That military budget represents about 53 cents of every discretionary dollar in the federal budget – and it’s one of the biggest reasons that people so often throw up their hands and shake their heads when they think about funding innovative ways to end poverty. They don’t need to throw up their hands, though. The politicians and pundits should just start listening to children. When young organizers from the Sunrise Movement recently challenged Senator Dianne Feinstein to support a Green New Deal, she told them “there’s no money to pay for it”. She probably didn’t expect those eight- and 10- and 11-year-old kids to respond immediately: “Yes, there is, there’s tons of money going to the military.” Feinstein responded condescendingly that the military does “important things” with that money. Our never-ending wars say otherwise. Last year saw the highest number of civilians killed in the Afghanistan war since the UN began keeping track – more than 3,800 people, 930 of them children. About a quarter of them were killed by US and Nato troops and their Afghan government allies – and most of those by US-Nato airstrikes and drone attacks. Thousands more were injured. Committing such mayhem doesn’t come cheap. Last year alone, the war in Afghanistan, in its 17th year, cost about $45bn. And that’s just the immediate cost of fighting the war – it doesn’t include the costs of caring for injured US soldiers, let alone Afghan victims. It doesn’t include training more soldiers to replace the ones occupying Afghanistan now, or the enormous sums spent on the base Pentagon budget. Most importantly, the war in Afghanistan hasn’t made us any safer, and isn’t making life better for the people of Afghanistan. (To take one grim measure, at the start of the war, Afghan babies faced the fourth-highest levels of infant mortality of any children in the world. Today, after almost 18 years of US war, Afghanistan is No 1.) And those soldiers that have come back from the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and beyond? They still aren’t getting the care they need. They still struggle to access Veterans Administration clinics and hospitals, and they’re still killing themselves at rates advocates deem a “national emergency”. According to the VA itself, the Guardian reports, veterans aged 18-34, many of whom served in Iraq and Afghanistan, have “higher rates of suicide than any other age group”. The human toll of these wars is staggering. And the financial costs are breathtaking. Neta Crawford, who co-directs the Cost of Wars Project at Brown University, estimated back in 2017 that total war spending in just Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan was approaching $5tn since 2001. When we’re talking about trillions of dollars – $2tn for Afghanistan and another $3tn or so for Iraq and beyond, Crawford calculates – it means there’s plenty of money to fund things that really do keep our people and our country safe. For just a quarter of that $2tn we’ve spent on a fruitless, brutal war in Afghanistan, the National Priorities Project at the Institute for Policy Studies calculates we could instead fund more than 103,000 elementary school teachers, 112,000 clean energy jobs, 935,000 Head Start slots, and healthcare for 806,000 veterans and more than 2.3 million adults, and retrofit nearly 5.8m houses for solar electricity. In fact, we could do all of that every year for 10 years. Compared to all this, paying trillions for war isn’t an investment – it’s just a loss. It’s loss at a scale that, if it were reversed, would make a Green New Deal, Medicare for All, and all the rest perfectly realistic. Which would make us safer?

"Australia is the only developed country that allows climate change funding to be used to upgrade coal-fired power plants, green finance experts say. Experts say allowing Vales Point coal-fired power station to register with the Morrison government’s emissions reduction fund, rebadged this week as a “climate solutions” policy, puts Australia out of step with the World Bank, Europe and the US, which have all rejected using climate financing for coal power retrofits. The World Bank has issued US$13bn in green bonds since 2008 to stimulate spending to combat global warming. China has used green bonds to help build new coal-fired plants to replace older, dirtier stations on the grounds it reduces nitrogen-based emissions causing the country’s oppressive air pollution. But it announced in December it would no longer consider “clean coal” plants – which still emit significant amounts of greenhouse gas – investments in green technology. Sean Kidney, chief executive of the London-based Climate Bonds Initiative, says China’s shift leaves Australia out on its own. “If you were committed to meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which the Australian government says it is committed to, this is just lunacy,” Kidney says. “No investors in the western world will accept any green bonds that incentivise anything like coal station retrofits. From an investor’s perspective, coal is a dead duck.” Emma Herd, chief executive of the Investor Group on Climate Change, says Australia is moving across the trend by considering giving taxpayer support to coal. In addition to the potential support through the climate solutions fund, the government is considering underwriting the cost of building new coal-fired power stations. In the past fortnight, mining giant Glencore has said it will cap coal production in response to pressure from shareholders, while Rio Tinto stressed it was the only large mining company with no fossil fuel investments, having sold its final coal assets to Glencore last year. From an investor’s perspective, coal is a dead duck “At a time when private-sector capital is increasingly looking for low carbon and decarbonisation opportunities, it would seem to be swimming against the tide to put government taxpayer funding into these [coal] activities,” Herd says. Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that  limiting global warming to 1.5C – a goal referenced in the Paris climate agreement – would require coal use for energy to fall 59-78% below 2010 levels by 2030. While global markets increasingly recognise a decline in coal use is inevitable, the shift away from it has been fitful. The Global Carbon Project found global emissions were likely to have hit a new high in 2018, in part due to an increase in coal burning in China. It bucked a global decline in emissions from coal in 2015 and 2016. Though it has been registered, Vales Point coal plant is yet to bid for money from the emissions reduction fund due to a dispute over whether it needs to reduce its carbon intensity to less than the grid average to win a government contract. The plant’s owners say the project would reduce emissions by 900,000 tonnes across a decade, equivalent to about 1.3% of the plant’s emissions over that time. The environment minister, Melissa Price, has backed the interpretation of the Clean Energy Regulator, which says the project does not qualify in its current form. The company disagrees, noting former environment minister Greg Hunt said the fund could be used to “clean up” power plants and that published guidelines explicitly said coal could win backing. The methodology is being reviewed by the independent emissions reduction assurance committee. Even if Vales Point is not successful, critics such as the Australian Conservation Foundation say there is nothing preventing other coal-fired plant owners from applying for a climate subsidy. Major companies are being paid from the fund for other fossil fuel projects: South African miner Gold Fields is getting $1m for a gas-fired plant the company says it would have built regardless; Rio Tinto has received $2m for a diesel-fired power plant at a bauxite mine. With prime minister Scott Morrison announcing the Coalition would top up the $2.55bn fund with an additional $2bn over a decade, economists and environmentalists have called for emissions from fossil fuels to be dealt with through different policies and for the fund to focus on projects that restore or protect natural habitat. Experts say the scheme will be improved if the government tightens the safeguard mechanism, a policy that was promised to limit emissions from big industry but which has largely allowed major companies to nominate their own pollution. National emissions have increased each year since the emissions reduction fund replaced the abolished carbon price scheme in 2014. Money from the fund is distributed via reverse auction, with land owners and businesses bidding for contracts to reduce emissions cheaply. Analyses have found some projects under the fund have merit but it is difficult to know what taxpayers are getting for their money. Some methodologies paid for cuts that would have happened anyway. Others have had any cuts more than wiped out by increases in pollution allowed elsewhere."
"When the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published their latest report in October, the message was stark: if the planet wants to avert dangerous climate breakdown, we need to cut emissions in half by 2030, and hit net zero by the middle of the century. It would be difficult to overstate how dramatic this trajectory is. It represents a total and rapid reversal of our present direction as a civilisation. We’ve built up a global energy infrastructure around fossil fuels over 200 years, and now we need to completely transform it in 30.  The only way to accomplish this feat is with coordinated government action on a massive scale. Proponents of the US’s Green New Deal idea have it right: we need to pump public investment into churning out solar panels, wind turbines and batteries at a historically unprecedented rate, reminiscent of the industrial retooling that enabled the allies to win the second world war. But even this won’t be enough, in and of itself. There’s something missing from the Green New Deal strategy – and it could turn out to be a fatal flaw. The problem with the existing plan is that it doesn’t address the paradox of growing energy demand. Over the past few years, scientists have been warning that we may fail to reach our climate goals even with the most aggressive efforts, because global economic growth is driving energy demand up at a pace that’s outstripping our ability to install clean power. Today the world is producing 8bn more megawatt hours of clean energy each year than in 2000. That’s a lot – enough to power all of Russia. But over exactly the same period, economic growth has caused energy demand to increase by a staggering 48bn megawatt hours. In other words, all that new clean energy we’ve rolled out covers only a small fraction of new demand. That’s why emissions keep rising. It’s like shovelling sand into a hole that just keeps getting bigger. This problem is going to eventually cripple us. If we continue growing the global economy at existing rates, it will nearly triple in size by the middle of the century. That’s three times more production and consumption than we’re already doing – which will require nearly three times more energy. It will be difficult enough for us to decarbonise the existing global economy – virtually impossible do it three times over. Our obsession with economic growth is making our task much more difficult than it needs to be. It’s like we’ve chosen to fight this battle facing uphill, with one hand tied behind our back. A key finding of the new IPCC report is the dramatic difference that restricting warming to 1.5C above pre industrial levels would have on the global environment. The scientists found: • By 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5C compared with 2C. • Extreme heatwaves will be experienced by 14% of the world's population at least once every five years at 1.5C. But that figure rises to more than a third of the planet if temperatures rise to 2C • Arctic sea ice would remain during most summers if warming is kept to 1.5C. But at 2C, ice free summers are 10 times more likely, leading to greater habitat losses for polar bears, whales, seals and sea birds. • If warming is kept to 1.5C, coral reefs will still decline by 70-90% but if temperatures rise to 2C virtually all of the world's reefs would be lost There’s an easier way. The recent IPCC report points out that to have a realistic chance at staying under 1.5C, we need to scale down energy demand. The scenario its proposes – developed by an international team of scientists – calls for high-income nations like Britain and the US to significantly reduce their consumption of material stuff. Right now, rich nations devour 28 tonnes of material per person per year – including everything from fish to forests, plastics to metals. That’s four times more than ecologists say is sustainable. It requires an extraordinary amount of energy to extract, produce and transport all that stuff. By using less of it, we can shrink global energy demand and make it much easier to decarbonise the economy. This isn’t just about convincing individuals to lead simpler lives, although of course we need that. It’s about changing the way our economy operates – liberating ourselves from the irrational imperative to grow material use unnecessarily. How can we do this? One way is to legislate extended warranties on products, so washing machines and refrigerators last for 30 years instead of 10. Another is to ban planned obsolescence, so manufacturers can’t create products that are designed to fail. And we could introduce a “right to repair” so we can get our smartphones and blenders fixed cheaply when they break down rather than having to buy new ones. We could also cut down on waste by banning food from landfill (as South Korea and France are doing). We could tax red meat to promote a shift to less resource-intensive foods, and ban single-use plastics and disposable coffee cups. We could liberate public spaces from advertising (like São Paulo has done) to free us from the psychological pressures of having to buy stuff just to feel good about ourselves. And we can expand access to public goods and develop platforms for sharing things like cars and lawnmowers. All of these measures would dramatically reduce material consumption, without any loss to our wellbeing. But to really make it work, we need to get straight to the heart of the issue: put a cap on annual material use and tighten it year on year, down to 8 tonnes per capita by the middle of the century. This will change incentives across the economy – reorienting people and business toward long-lasting, repairable and recyclable products. By dramatically reducing energy demand, this approach will give us a good shot at accomplishing our climate goals. What’s exciting about this is that it doesn’t just help us avert climate breakdown. It also provides our best hope of reversing other aspects of ecological collapse – from deforestation to soil depletion, from biodiversity loss to insect die-off. Reducing our material impact on the Earth means freeing up more space for other living systems to recover and thrive. We need to do everything we can to transition to clean energy, yes. But we’ll only succeed if we reduce the amount of energy we consume in the first place, rather than continuing to grow it. The science is clear: scaling down material use must be at the core of the Green New Deal – and at the centre of our climate policy. • Jason Hickel is an anthropologist at the London School of Economics"

"The number of heatwaves affecting the planet’s oceans has increased sharply, scientists have revealed, killing swathes of sea-life like “wildfires that take out huge areas of forest”. The damage caused in these hotspots is also harmful for humanity, which relies on the oceans for oxygen, food, storm protection and the removal of climate-warming carbon dioxide the atmosphere, they say.  Global warming is gradually increasing the average temperature of the oceans, but the new research is the first systematic global analysis of ocean heatwaves, when temperatures reach extremes for five days or more. The research found heatwaves are becoming more frequent, prolonged and severe, with the number of heatwave days tripling in the last couple of years studied. In the longer term, the number of heatwave days jumped by more than 50% in the 30 years to 2016, compared with the period of 1925 to 1954. As heatwaves have increased, kelp forests, seagrass meadows and coral reefs have been lost. These foundation species are critical to life in the ocean. They provide shelter and food to many others, but have been hit on coasts from California to Australia to Spain. “You have heatwave-induced wildfires that take out huge areas of forest, but this is happening underwater as well,” said Dan Smale at the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, UK, who led the research published in Nature Climate Change. “You see the kelp and seagrasses dying in front of you. Within weeks or months they are just gone, along hundreds of kilometres of coastline.” As well as quantifying the increase in heatwaves, the team analysed 116 research papers on eight well-studied marine heatwaves, such as the record-breaking “Ningaloo Niño” that hit Australia in 2011 and the hot “blob” that persisted in the north-east Pacific from 2013 to 2016. “They have adverse impacts on a wide range of organisms, from plankton to invertebrates, to fish, mammals and seabirds,” Smale said. The scientists compared the areas where heatwaves have increased most with those areas harbouring rich biodiversity or species already near their temperature limit and those where additional stresses, such as pollution or overfishing, already occur. This revealed hotspots of harm from the north-east Atlantic to the Caribbean to the western Pacific. “A lot of ocean systems are being battered by multiple stresses,” Smale said. The natural ocean cycle of El Niño is a key factor in pushing up temperatures in some parts of the ocean and the effect of global warming on the phenomenon remains uncertain, but the gradual overall heating of the oceans means heatwaves are worse when they strike. “The starting temperature is much higher, so the absolute temperatures [in a heatwave] are that much higher and more stressful,” said Smale. Some marine wildlife is mobile and could in theory swim to cooler waters, but ocean heatwaves often strike large areas more rapidly than fish move, he said. The researchers said ocean heatwaves can have “major socioeconomic and political ramifications”, such as in the north-west Atlantic in 2012, when lobster stocks were dramatically affected, creating tensions across the US-Canada border. “This [research] makes clear that heatwaves are hitting the ocean all over the world … The ocean, in effect, is spiking a fever,” said Prof Malin Pinsky, at Rutgers University, US, and not part of the team. “These events are likely to become more extreme and more common in the future unless we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Dr Éva Plagányi at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia also likened ocean heatwaves to wildfires. “Frequent big hits can have long-lasting effects,” she said. “This study shows that record-breaking events are becoming the new normal.” The damage global warming is causing to the oceans has also been shown in a series of other scientific papers published in the last week. Ocean warming has cut sustainable fish catches by 15% to 35% in five regions, including the North Sea and the East China Sea, and 4% globally, according to work published by Pinsky and colleagues. “We were stunned to find that fisheries around the world have already responded to ocean warming,” he said. Another study showed that achieving the 2C climate change target set out in the Paris agreement would protect almost 10m tonnes of fish catches each year, worth tens of billions of dollars. Separate work by Plagányi’s team showed that climate change will reverse the recovery of whales in the Southern Ocean by damaging the krill on which they feed. “Models predict concerning declines, and even local extinctions by 2100, for Pacific populations of blue and fin whales, and Atlantic and Indian Ocean fin and humpback whales,” they said. “In the space of one week, scientific publications have underscored that unless we take evasive action, our future oceans will have fewer fish, fewer whales and frequent dramatic shifts in ecological structure will occur, with concerning implications for humans who depend on the ocean,” said Plagányi."
"Costa Rica has launched an economy-wide plan to “decarbonize” the country by 2050, as the Central American nation aims to show other nations what is possible to address climate change. Environment minister, Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, said that if the plan is achieved, his grandchildren in 2035 will have the same carbon footprint as his grandparents did in the 1940s – and by 2050 his grandchildren will have none at all.  “Not only are we going to reduce that footprint but we are going to bring many benefits with it,” Rodríguez said. But Jairo Quirós, an electrical energy researcher at the University of Costa Rica, warned the plan would be challenging, and “should be viewed with some caution”. Under the roadmap launched Sunday, Costa Rica by 2050 would achieve “zero net emissions”, meaning it would produce no more emissions than it can offset through things such as maintaining and expanding its extensive forests. Such emission cuts are key to holding increases in global temperature to well under 2C (3.6F), the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The Costa Rica plan aims to allow the country to continue growing economically while cutting greenhouse gases. The country’s economy grew at 3% last year, according to World Bank data. Christiana Figueres, the Costa Rican former UN climate chief, called the goal “unprecedented” in international politics. Only the government of the tiny Marshall Islands also has laid out a detailed plan to achieve that goal, but “they still do not have the whole plan articulated sector by sector”, Figueres told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. President Carlos Alvarado noted that while Costa Rica represents only a tiny share of the world’s climate-changing emissions, the plan could be a model for other nations. “We can be that example – we have to inspire people,” he said at the plan’s launch,. But Quirós, of the University of Costa Rica, warned the plan will take hard work to achieve. Some goals, he said, such as ensuring all buses and taxis run on electricity by 2050, may be difficult, not least because the changes will be expensive. Transport today creates about 40% of Costa Rica’s climate-changing emissions, making it the largest single source of them, according to the National Meteorological Institute. The new plan aims to modernize public transport, including through the creation of an electric train line﻿ that would connect 15 of the 31 neighborhoods in the San José metropolitan area, according to the Costa Rican Institute of Railways. Construction on the lines is expected to start in 2022. Under Costa Rica’s decarbonization plan, the number of cars circulating in urban areas would be cut by half by 2040, the environment minister said. By 2035, 70% of the country’s buses would be electric and 25% of its cars, Rodríguez added. Costa Rica does not have a fossil fuel extraction industry, but dependence on oil revenue could still cause problems. Fuel taxes, vehicle import taxes and driving taxes currently account for about 12% of government revenue, the minister said. To phase out fossil fuels without slashing government income, the government will need to push for “green tax reform” to find new revenue sources, he said – which would need legislative approval. Under the plan, the country’s state-owned petroleum distributor would change course and begin research on alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels, and look at helping fossil fuel workers move to clean energy jobs. The plan also calls for further expanding forests – though at the moment most of the money to pay for that comes from taxes on fossil fuels, Rodríguez admitted. “In the 1960s and 70s, Costa Rica had the highest per capita deforestation rate in the world. We have managed not only to stop deforestation but to double forest coverage” as the economy grew, Rodríguez said. Last year, 98% of the country’s electricity came from renewable sources, according to the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, the state-owned company in charge of electricity generation and distribution. Quirós, the University of Costa Rica researcher, said the country’s plan, while “a little utopian” was clearly “a step in the right direction”. “It’s good to be ambitious,” he said."
"Nicola Sturgeon’s government needs to show much greater urgency in tackling climate change, a cross-party committee of the Scottish parliament has said. The environment committee said the Scottish government’s goal of cutting emissions by 90% before 2050 failed to address the scale of the challenge. Instead, ministers should aim for a net zero target, where there are no additional emissions that affect the climate, MSPs said.  In a detailed report on the Scottish government’s climate bill, the committee said ministers needed to heed the latest advice from the International Panel on Climate Change, which called for global action to cap emissions at 1.5C. Achieving that target required much more radical and swifter action, the committee said. They said the scale of the changes to the way the economy operated to ensure emissions did not breach a 1.5C increase was “unprecedented in human history”. There needed to be “a greater urgency of action across all parts of government, across the public and private sectors and by individuals, to deliver the transformational change required. “Climate change is an intergenerational justice issue and the committee believes we need to act now to help ensure future generations inherit a world that is sustainable.” Scottish ministers insist their goal of reaching 90% by 2050 is a realistic target but said they could revise those targets after getting updated advice from the UK committee on climate change, an official body set up to advise the UK and devolved governments, due in May. “We want to go further and achieve net-zero emissions for all greenhouse gases as soon as possible,” it said in a statement. “We’ll set a target date as soon as this can be done credibly and responsibly.” The Holyrood committee’s criticisms increase pressure on the Scottish government to set tougher targets. Caroline Rance, a climate campaigner from Friends of the Earth Scotland, said ministers should also set much tougher emission reduction targets for 2030. “Climate change is the most urgent and pressing crisis facing the world and Scotland’s targets for cutting emissions must reflect our commitment to meeting that challenge,” she said. Protesters from the radical activist group Extinction Rebellion have targeted Holyrood twice in the past six weeks. Calling for a net zero target of 2025, they staged a sit-in at Holyrood’s debating chamber in January and tried to mount a protest at first minister’s questions last Thursday, but were stopped by police. The Scottish Greens and environmentalists were highly critical of the Scottish government’s progress on tackling carbon emissions from transport last week after the latest data showed levels of bus use and cycling were falling while car use and flights were increasing. Railway use had also gone up."
"Record temperatures in complete contrast to the weather at this time last year have led to signs that spring has sprung much earlier than usual in the UK, and naturalists have expressed worry about what this means for the environment.  We asked you to share the signs where you are, and received thoughtful contributions and photographs from around the UK. After a warm weekend for much of Britain, Anna Markwell, in East Sussex, said: “It’s lovely, but worryingly mild.” Her sentiment was echoed in many of your stories; the flutter of butterflies and buzzing of bees is something to be savoured – but could their early appearance lead to environmental disaster? And could the need for an early antihistamine dose be the least of our problems in the coming years? Below are some of your stories and photographs. Patrick Green was one of many readers to share concern in his contribution (which included the image at the top of this piece, taken in north London’s Clissold Park). “The scenes are very beautiful, and I’m very pleased with the pictures I took on 22 February, but I know I’m seeing them too early: climate change terrifies me,” he wrote. “Politicians are in a permanent state of denial and seem oblivious to what is staring them in the face. The weather on our shared planet is changing in dangerous and unpredictable ways and the future of humanity is at stake.” Petr Skapa is also worried: “This wild plum tree grows alongside a public footpath where dog walkers, joggers, families with children and young couples are casually passing without even noticing it. “I am perplexed by the apparent public indifference toward weather swings in the last 20 years. If the scientists are correct with their climate modelling, the swings are not only here to stay but are set to increase, causing havoc in living nature; forests, agriculture, everything will change, and not for the better. How this flowery demonstration of a trend toward a future laden with risks to water and food security doesn’t alarm everyone passing by is beyond me.” Several readers contacted us to say they had been surprised to see butterflies around already. It is unusual to see a red admiral so early, according to Butterfly Conservation, but Anne Davison saw this specimen on 22 February, resting on an Edgeworthia chrysantha bush in her garden near Stamford, Lincolnshire. Bees were also early visitors to gardens and parks near many of you. “They are around pollinating crocuses and there are a lot more flowers around in general,” says Julie Prescott, echoing many fellow readers’ surprise and concern for the creatures. “It’s a big contrast to 21 February last year, which was very snowy here in Blyton, Lincolnshire.” Gareth Todd Jones, who keeps honey bees in the Rhondda valley, south Wales, remembers nursing them through a cold early 2018 and is struck by the difference this year: “Watching the way they are reacting to February temperatures that are really too high is fascinating. Honey bees are the ultimate evolvers, but I can’t help but be concerned!” Andy Bell, in Burton upon Trent, sent this picture of frogspawn in his pond. Pools in Mark Palmer’s allotment in Ulverston, Cumbria, have also filled with spawn over the last week. “It is earlier by around two weeks than normal, perhaps because we have not yet had any really heavy frosts – being on the northern side of Morecambe Bay probably helps with sheltered weather.” Veronica Love, in Dumfries and Galloway, shared a similar story. “Soft croaks on Sunday morning led me to the side of our garden pond where I watched two frogs mating – and a third trying and failing to muscle in. I expect frogspawn to appear soon, but it doesn’t stay long as the goldfish feast on it.” Reports that the air is unusually perfumed this spring due to warm weather in 2018 are perhaps confirmed by Helen Garland, in Bristol. “These iris were inherited from my mother and my grandmother, and normally flower in April. They are a really old variety that have a scent, so it’s strange to see them already.” Helen Evans, a reader in Ruthin, north Wales, notes down the first time she sees certain flowers each year. “I made a point of looking for violets on my walk on 23 February and did see a few growing next to a country lane. In 2016 the first violet was 12 March, 11 March in 2017 and 24 March last year.” “It’s been incredibly warm,” says Courtney Hopf, in east London, another reader to note record snowfalls this time in 2018. “I know [parakeets] are essentially invasive pests, but seeing that flash of tropical green in London always gives me a little thrill. This parakeet and three others were busily nibbling this tree’s blossoms for hours last Friday.” Foragers among you have been enjoying early crops. John Kelly said he’d collected “boatloads of mature wild garlic” in Leeds over the last few days. Elizabeth, in Cardiff, said she’d been harvesting garlic for around three weeks, much earlier than usual. Tell us about the early signs of spring where you are – and how you feel about it – in the comments. You can also share photographs and stories in our callout."
"The government has been warned against complacency on climate change action after figures showed a slowdown in the rate of Britain’s carbon emission cuts. Emissions dropped for the sixth year running in 2018, to 361m tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent, a level last seen in the late 19th century. But there are signs the country’s recent period of rapid progress is drawing to a close. The estimated 1.5% decline last year was considerably smaller than the 3.2% fall in 2017 and the 8.7% drop in 2014: the biggest in recent years. Labour, which has pitched itself as more radical than the government on climate change action, said the figures showed the need to speed up decarbonisation. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: “The government are wrong to be complacent about the UK’s falling emissions when we know that winning slowly on climate change is the same as losing.” UK emissions have been on a long-term trend downwards over the past three decades, and the pace has picked up in recent years. Coal power’s decline over the past decade accounted for three-quarters of CO2 reductions over that period, according to the website Carbon Brief, which estimates emissions from an analysis of government energy data. Simon Evans, the policy editor at the group, said: “The lion’s share of recent CO2 reductions in the UK have been due to falling coal use.” But he said that with coal power now accounting for 5% of electricity generation, the scope for additional emissions cuts was “increasingly limited”. One major coal power station in Yorkshire closed last year, and another in Nottinghamshire is to close in September. The economics of UK coal power have deteriorated in recent years. Ministers have promised to shut the last seven plants by 2025, though market forces mean that landmark could be reached earlier, in 2023. While the power sector has driven most of the UK’s recent emissions cuts, other sectors have either stalled or got worse. The Carbon Brief figures show oil and gas use – primarily used for vehicles, power and heating – have barely changed over the past few years. Transport has become the biggest single polluting sector, overtaking energy. Evans said: “The UK will not be able to meet its legally-binding climate goals in future without progress across all fuels and sectors.” The Committee on Climate Change, the government’s climate advisers, recently said that emissions have begun to increase in some sectors, such as construction. Experts said future emissions cuts would not necessarily be more costly, but would be politically harder. Michael Grubb, professor of energy and climate change at University College London, said: “The next steps involve more coordination of government efforts – the infrastructure and industrial policy dimensions of electric vehicles, coordination of zero carbon homes with housing policy. “I don’t see higher costs, but tougher lobbying and coordination problems which can’t easily be tackled through economic instruments or auctions [as seen in the power sector].” Carbon Brief has a strong track record of closely predicting the official emissions figures, which will be published by the government later in March."
"The UK has experienced its warmest winter day on record, the Met Office has revealed. Temperatures in Kew Gardens, south-west London, reached 21.2C (70.2F), breaking the record for the warmest February day. The Met Office defines winter from the beginning of December to the end of February, so Tuesday’s sunny spell is also a winter record.  The record had already been broken on Monday, when temperatures exceeded 20C during winter for the very first time. This week’s unseasonably warm weather differs dramatically from the beginning of the month, when sub-zero temperatures were recorded across the country. The previous winter record had been 19.7C in Greenwich, south-east London, in 1998. “The average temperature for this time of year is 9C in London and 9C in north Wales, so what we’re seeing is 10 degrees above average,” said Martin Bowles, a Met Office meteorologist. Bowles said: “We can’t blame climate change directly because we’re talking about weather, not the climate. But it is a sign of climate change. There’s been a gradual increase of temperatures over the last 30 years so the extreme weather has also been increasing.” Parts of Britain on Tuesday were hotter than Malibu, Athens, Crete and Barcelona. The warm weather is in stark contrast to this time last year, when the “beast from the east” swept across much of the UK, bringing heavy snow showers and lows of -5C. The cold conditions caused travel delays and power cuts in what were the lowest temperatures in the week leading up to 1 March since 1986. Bowles said the warm temperatures were largely because of an area of pressure over the North Sea, which was drawing up warm air from the south. Last year’s cold weather was because of a similar weather pattern, but the high pressure came from Arctic Russia, before moving over Scandinavia. The conditions seen this week come from the tropical Atlantic and parts of north Africa. While temperatures are forecast to reach 19C on Wednesday, the Met Office is expecting to see a change from Thursday onwards, when weather from the Atlantic will bring colder showers. “We’re having a very warm end to winter, but will see a typical beginning to spring,” Bowles said Heavy showers are possible at the end of the week, as temperatures will struggle to get above 11C or 12C."
"Saudi Arabia’s state oil company has said the industry faces a “crisis of perception” because society believes it has no future, which it says could threaten world energy security. Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Saudi Aramco, said financiers at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month had told him the sector had only a few years left because of trends such as the rise of electric cars.  Policymakers, regulators, investors and NGOs increasingly believed that oil and gas firms have little or no future, he said. “My encounters in Davos showed me that fewer and fewer of our stakeholders accept logic and facts, least of all from us. We are therefore facing what I would call a crisis of perception,” he told an industry audience in London. He said: “Because it [the crisis] threatens our industry’s very relevance, it puts our ability to supply ample, reliable and affordable energy to billions around the world at risk, which in turn risks their energy security.” Nasser claimed the idea that oil demand would soon peak, which most authorities think will happen in the next two decades, was an exaggerated theory. Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s biggest oil producers, with only Russia and the US on a par, and it plans to increase its output in the coming decade. Nasser’s speech did not explicitly mention climate change but he said one of the remedies to the sector’s image problem was to understand society wanted clean energy and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Asked what the Paris climate agreement meant for Saudi Aramco, he boasted that the company would become a “global leader” in another fossil fuel – gas. He also said Saudi Aramco would invest more in petrochemicals but that it would not yet be entering the renewables market because the Gulf kingdom was already investing in solar power. Nasser said that if the firm stopped investing now, the world would face a shortfall in oil supply in five years’ time that would lead to higher oil prices – reinforcing a perception the industry was profiteering. Saudi Aramco is reportedly the world’s most profitable company. Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, said he agreed with the Saudi oil boss. “The world is driven by myths and not facts,” he said. Dudley said: “I think we have a particular challenge with [the perception of] energy. But I think business in general has a huge communications issue. I think we are seeing the effects of the financial crisis rolling through now, particularly in the western world, and everybody is looking for people to blame. Unfortunately I think the political system is starting to blame companies and business more.” On Tuesday, oil prices crept up to $65 (£49) a barrel. On Monday, they had fallen when Donald Trump tweeted that they were getting too high and told oil cartel Opec – of which Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader – the world could not take a price hike."
"Scott Morrison will attempt to appeal to voters deeply concerned that the Coalition have been been wreckers on climate change by rebadging Tony Abbott’s emissions reduction fund as a “climate solutions” fund – with $2bn to be rolled out over 10 years. Attempting to draw a line over years of destructive in-fighting within the Coalition that has cruelled various emissions reduction policies, the prime minister will use a speech in Melbourne on Monday to launch a new package of measures on climate change, saying his government acknowledges and accepts the challenge “but we do so with cool heads, not just impassioned hearts”.  The emissions reduction fund is a vestige of Abbott’s heavily criticised Direct Action policy. Funded by taxpayers initially at $2.5bn, the ERF pays farmers and businesses to cut carbon dioxide pollution to below what it would otherwise be. But an investigation by Guardian Australia last year found it was often difficult to determine if the fund was offering value for money. Malcolm Turnbull, who once branded the approach “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”, let the ERF dwindle to almost nothing as he pursued policy alternatives, including the national energy guarantee resisted by conservatives and dumped by Morrison shortly after he took the Liberal leadership last year. Morrison will confirm on Monday the ERF will be rebadged a “climate solutions fund” and given a 10-year funding profile. The rebooted fund will partner with farmers, local governments and businesses to deliver “practical climate solutions” across the economy that reduce carbon emissions. The prime minister will also continue to assert that Australia will meet its Paris target despite the trend of rising emissions in the economy that has been evident in the government’s own figures since the abolition of the carbon price in 2013. But a chart released in advance of Monday’s speech makes it clear the looming abatement exercise will rely significantly on accounting measures as well as on practical emissions reduction. According to projections done last December, the government will count a 367 megatonne abatement from carry-over credits (an accounting system that allows countries to count carbon credits from exceeding their targets under the soon-to-be-obsolete Kyoto protocol periods against their Paris commitment for 2030) to help meet the 2030 target. It is also factoring in emissions reduction from Turnbull’s pet project, the Snowy 2.0 expansion (which the Morrison government has not yet formally signed off on); energy efficiency measures; an electric vehicle strategy (that it has not yet unveiled); the rebadged climate solutions fund; additional hydro projects and just under 100Mt of abatement from “technology solutions” (which aren’t specified) and “other sources of abatement” such as projects under development but not yet contracted. The government says examples of projects to be assisted under its rebadged ERF will include funding for remote indigenous communities to reduce severe bushfires in rural and remote areas; support for small business to replace lighting, air conditioning and refrigeration systems to help reduce energy costs; drought proofing on farms; and support for local communities to reduce waste and increasing recycling rates. Liberal MPs have been lobbying the leadership to pull together a package of climate measures, with many reporting a significant voter backlash about the Coalition’s destructive record on climate policy. Strategists for both major parties report that after a summer characterised by extreme weather and prolonged heatwaves, voters are more concerned about climate change now than they have been at any time since 2007. Liberals are also under fire in their electoral heartland from small “l” liberal independents campaigning on the Coalition’s poor record on climate change, highlighting past behaviour like cutting the renewable energy target and attempting to abolish agencies like the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Arena. Morrison will on Monday attempt a course correction, saying the government is committed to “meaningful, practical action on climate change, without damaging our economy or the family budget”. “We will continue to play our part in meeting the global challenge of climate change in the 21st century,” the prime minister will say. “We will do so without taking a sledgehammer to our economy. Without putting our electricity market at risk. Without putting pressure on electricity prices. Without destroying jobs in our traditional industries and in regional Australia. “This is the responsible and balanced course. And we must stay the course”."

"As you say, the cement component of concrete generates much CO2 (Concrete: the most destructive material on Earth, 26 February). Roughly 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of cement. Or 1 million tonnes per year of CO2 for a small-sized plant. Cement consumption per capita is between 50kg and 2,000kg per person per year, depending on the phase of development of the country and the availability of alternative building materials. Taking an unholy average, each member of the human population is responsible, through their fondness for a built environment, for roughly 500kg per year of CO2 from cement. What you forgot to point out is that human metabolism contributes roughly 300kg per person per year of CO2 through exhaled breath. Perhaps more in Westminster, the offices of newspapers and the vicinity of sports grounds. The annual US dollar turnover of the worldwide cement industry, by the by, is only 60% of that of Walmart. Suffice to say that the most destructive material on Earth is not concrete. It’s not oil or coal either. The most destructive material on Earth is human flesh. The clue is in the anthropo part of anthropogenic climate change. If you really want to save the planet a radical cull is required, but if you’re too tender for that, worry not. The Verhulst model for population growth suggests that the adjustment will happen of itself.Peter Anderson(Consulting engineer to the cement industry), Barwick-in-Elmet, West Yorkshire  • In George Monbiot’s manifesto for climate strikers (Opinion, 20 February), he suggests: “The world has been thrown into climate chaos, caused by fossil fuel companies, the billionaires who profit from them and the politicians they have bought.” And he proposes the restoration of the “benign conditions in which humans and other species can thrive”. Unfortunately, he’s completely missed one of the main issues driving climate change, namely the huge increase in the number of people living on this planet. When he was born in 1963 the world population was 3.2 billion. Today, just 56 years later, it’s around 7.7 billion. It’s precisely the success of our thriving human population that is causing untold damage around the world to the “other species” he mentions. We’re adding around 81 million people a year to the world’s population, and climate change is just one of the consequences of massive population growth. It’s no good just reducing carbon emissions; we also need to have fewer children. This will be the fastest way to save our planet. And politicians, economists and businesspeople must stop talking about “growth” being a good thing. We urgently need to start planning to decrease our population growth and our economies and world travel, and put a halt to flagrant spending on throwaway goods etc. Only then will our (far fewer) grandchildren have a better life.Jonathan CockburnHewelsfield, Gloucestershire • Jonathan Watts does us an important service (Decline in biodiversity ‘threatens food crisis’, 22 February) in bringing to our attention the comprehensive UN report on the state of the world’s biodiversity with respect to our need for food, and the many factors threatening food production. Too often, particular threats to humanity are identified, attracting justified concern and attention, when they themselves have a more fundamental upstream cause. Climate change is driven by climate changers, all 7.7 billion of us, increasing at more than 80 million annually. Each new soul will need additional food, energy, housing, education and health services, and clean water and air in an increasingly polluted world. We have to talk about population. Charities such as Population Matters, for whom Sir David Attenborough and several other scientists are patrons, show how entirely non-coercive and proven ways are available for the reduction and reversal of population growth urgently required. When women have access to education and contraception, they will not choose to have more children than they can support.

"Last week, supposedly unprecedented spring wildfires raged across dry, bushy and exposed areas. On Monday, having dealt with serious incidents at Saddleworth Moor and Hundred Acre Wood, teams of specialised firefighters also attended the small piece of Shredded Wheat that lives on top of Andrew Neil’s head. Dozens of grateful weevils were saved from certain death in the breakfast bisc inferno by the firefighters and rehoused in temporary accommodation in the nearby clumps of Andrew Neil’s ear hair, while his nostrils became emergency treatment centres for scorched pests.  Andrew Neil’s head wheat had begun smouldering when he heard that Penny Mordaunt MP had agreed to be filmed for This Week, making the case for Hard Brexit while swimming around a giant floating model of the UK in Liverpool’s Royal Albert Dock. Neil’s morning bisc crown had crumbled during the blaze and so its remains were eaten as a This Week green room snack by Michael Portillo, who lapped up the wheaten fragments with warmed milk from his dish, like a pleased cat. Nonetheless, weather women smiled cheerily on Tuesday as they announced the hottest British February on record. Their happiness perhaps tells you that the so-called “climate change” situation isn’t as serious as the doomsayers and gloom-mongers out there would have us believe. After all, if it really was too hot for the daffodils to survive, wouldn’t they just stay in the ground and wait? Recently, the Times’s Quentin Letts and Julia Hartley-Brewer’s Julia Hartley-Brewer both tweeted, with delight, that they were able to ski across the Swiss border unhindered. This apparently showed that there was no need for a British border in Ireland, because of blah blah blah shit piss wank. It also proved that it can’t be that hot as otherwise there wouldn’t be any snow, which is all made out of coldness, like in Frozen. Some misery-gongers and doom-dongers have even suggested that the late Professor Stephen Hawking’s 2017 warning, that Earth had only 100 more years of habitability, now looks optimistic. But Hawking was a liar, because if the world really was in trouble like how he said it was, then why wouldn’t he of used his mind to invent a invention to mend it? It proved very convenient for the biased Hard Remainiac BBC that this supposed climate emergency emerged last week. It distracts from any positive coverage of their hated Brexit. Indeed, the crisis of democracy in our parliament has barely been talked about since Andrew Neil’s carbohydrate yarmulke combusted on Monday. Instead, all we seemed to hear about all week was the imminence of the climate threat to all life on Earth, the inevitability of major environmental disasters, killing billions, and the need to change immediately to a global zero carbon economy or face mass extinction by the middle of the century. What we should still have been talking about, of course, and at the expense of everything else, for years and years, today and every day, is our membership, or non-membership, of a European trading bloc and how this affects the power bases of the principal political parties in the United Kingdom in the short term. Not the death of all life on Earth. On Monday night, tiny Jeremy Corbyn shifted his two buttocks slightly on his north London fence, the kitten weight of his coddled-egg-nourished frame pivoting slightly towards the possibility of maybe having a second referendum, if Tom Watson and Keir Starmer and the Labour party membership absolutely insist, but not really, obviously. Indeed, the British people’s democratic right to ruin their own country for a generation at least, destroy the livelihoods of their most vulnerable communities and sabotage food and medicine security indefinitely must be respected without question, like an old-fashioned village policeman or a violent Ape-God. Those who tremble at the prospect of shortages of vital supplies just need to think of creative solutions. If each one of the veritable tide of illegal migrants currently swamping British beaches was required to bring with them some plasters and a courgette, we could soon compensate for a ferry service optimistically expected to operate at 8% of the projected required capacity. By Wednesday, the biased Hard Remainiac BBC had begun looping mobile phone footage of Andrew Neil’s burning cereal hair, including shocking film of Michael Portillo rescuing the charred remnants from a filthy bin with his bare hands in order to make himself his milky treat, even as Alan Johnson tried to hold him back. The scheduling of the controversial hair inferno clip seemed designed to shunt Brexit down the newspipe and to distract from the fact that the promise of finally leaving the hated EU seemed to be slipping from the betrayed British public’s grasp. But there is so much more to be said about Brexit. We need to know the exact terms upon which, in the near future, our scorched nation will be exporting the deformed vegetables retched up from its charred soils to other ruined lands; and we need to know the exact levels of violence we are allowed to use to repel economic migrants attempting entry to the UK from soon-to-be-uninhabitable regions of France and Spain. Can a hungry Spaniard be shot or merely punched, as he makes landfall in Dover? What about a Frenchman, desperate for sparkling mineral water and the grapes that will now grow in newly temperate Scotland? Will it be acceptable, under the terms of our future trading arrangements, to force him back from the beach into the sea with a wooden club? Or to poke him with a poisoned spike? Happy about this February summer? It’s like hitting puberty at three years old and getting excited about being able to choose a bra ahead of schedule. Nero fiddled while Rome burned. Now the world is burning while Britain fiddles about.

"Carmakers gathering at the annual Geneva motor show this week were hoping the Alpine spring air and customary launches of new models would be a springboard for an industry fightback. Some of the world’s largest manufacturers have stumbled in the past 12 months, with sales under pressure on various fronts, particularly in Germany’s giant car industry. Ford and Jaguar Land Rover skipped the show after announcing thousands of job cuts in January.  Concerns in Europe over pollution have led to tighter restrictions on diesel cars and an ensuing dent in sales, and the Chinese market on which many manufacturers rely for growth shrank during 2018 for the first time in decades. Then there is Brexit. It hangs over manufacturers with British operations and the many more who sell to one of the world’s most lucrative car markets. Here are six things we learned at the show. This year’s gathering was the last before Brexit day on 29 March, and with only three weeks to go and the political mood pointing to either an extension of the negotiation period or no deal at all, carmakers’ warnings reached a new pitch of alarm. BMW gave a clear signal that a no-deal Brexit, in which trade defaults to World Trade Organization terms, including tariffs on cars and parts, could prove destructive for the British car industry. BMW’s Mini brand would face a “huge burden”, according to the board member Peter Schwarzenbauer, which might make it consider moving out of its Cowley plant in Oxford. Top executives from Toyota, Bentley and Vauxhall’s owner, PSA all expressed similar concerns about short and longer-term costs if barriers to trade between the UK and EU are erected. Maxime Picat, PSA’s operational director for Europe, said: “It’s difficult for me to imagine that you can rebuild a UK automotive industry, self-centred, looking only at the UK.” Despite JLR’s recent travails and its absence on the showroom floor, the victory of the Jaguar I-Pace in the coveted European car of the year award underlined one of the key trends in Geneva, the quickening pace of electrification as the price of batteries falls and demand for zero-emission vehicles rises. The I-Pace’s success set the stage for a range of models that rely on battery technology. Peugeot unveiled an electric version of its 208 supermini aimed at the mass market, Renault said its new Clio would have a hybrid option and the Volvo-owned Polestar 2 saloon is aiming for the same customer base as the US battery pioneer Tesla. Volkswagen, which is trying to move on from the emissions-cheating scandal that accelerated diesel’s decline, unveiled a beach buggy vehicle as part of the electric ID range, which will be in dealerships in 2020. Motor shows are still monuments to the consumer dream of owning and driving one’s own car but the coming shift to driverless vehicles is starting to register, even if the technology is not quite there yet. The German company e.Go Moove aims to produce almost fully autonomous minibuses by the middle of the next decade. Aston Martin’s sister brand, Lagonda, said it wanted its autonomous SUV to roll off its Welsh production line in 2022. While we await fully autonomous technology, Citroen’s Ami One concept takes a different approach to city mobility. The low-powered car would be picked up by anyone – even without a licence – using an app, in a similar way to city cycle hire schemes. At the luxury end of the market carmakers face completely different challenges in attracting customers. The French supercar maker Bugatti’s gambit at Geneva was nothing less than the world’s most expensive new car, La Voiture Noire, a one-off extravagance for an unnamed buyer priced at €11m (£9.5m). Stephan Winkelmann, Bugatti’s president, said the car represented extreme luxury, with a black carbon fibre body and a 1500-horsepower, 16-cylinder engine. Despite the hype over the gas-guzzling Bugatti, electrification is coming even at the very top end of the market. The Italian marque Pininfarina introduced the Battista all-electric hyper car, which can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph within two seconds. The challenge for luxury manufacturers is the timing of the inevitable change to electric. “We want to sell clean, high-power petrol engines for as long as we can,” said Bentley’s chief executive, Adrian Hallmark. Aside from carbon dioxide, however, the company still has another important output from internal combustion to work on, engine noise. Designers are focused on identifying the all-electric experience that will prompt drivers to shell out hundreds of thousands of pounds on a car. “We are in the entertainment industry, at the end of the day,” said McLaren’s chief financial officer, Paul Buddin. “It’s about how you feel when you’re driving the car.” Even Formula 1 racing bowed to the inevitable and got rid of its “grid girls” last year but a minority of exhibitors at Geneva appear to have missed the memo that having conspicuously young and tightly clothed women on their stands tends to be frowned upon. With the uncomfortable exception of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, most of the big brands have stamped out the practice. More niche brands, however, still featured the occasional throwback. The luxury car modifiers Mansory and Klassen, Pininfarina and the tyre makers Yokohama and Pirelli – maker of the infamous calendars - all featured models with expressions of intense boredom posing for men’s photos."

"The publisher of a NSW year-10 history book has rejected complaints from the federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly that it misrepresents facts about climate change. Kelly took issue with the characterisation of climate change in the textbook Pearson History New South Wales.  Kelly has written to the NSW education minister, Rob Stokes, saying the book’s description of Tony Abbott as a climate change denier was “an offensive slur equating it with Holocaust deniers”, the Daily Telegraph reported. The book says: “Climate change is noticeable in Australia, with more extreme frequent weather events such as the 2002-06 drought or the 2010-11 Queensland floods.” “That is simply an inaccurate statement that is in a school history book,” Kelly told parliament’s federation chamber last week. “What chance do we have of forming the best policies in this nation to deal with fire, floods and drought if we have children being misled by incorrect information in our history books?” He quoted Dorothea Mackellar’s poem My Country to argue contemporary natural disasters are nothing out of the ordinary: “I love a sunburnt country, a land of sweeping plains, of ragged mountain ranges, of droughts and flooding rains,” the poem says. “We need to understand that we live in that same country that Dorothea Mackellar wrote about over a hundred years ago,” Kelly said. “That is why we need to prepare and help people recover from their resources instead of wasting money pretending that we can change the weather.” The Australian Bureau of Meterology says “one of the greatest impacts of climate variability and climate change occurs through changes in the frequency and severity of extreme events.” It describes the 2011 Brisbane floods as the second-highest flood level of the last 100 years, after January 1974. The bureau and CSIRO’s latest State of the Climate report said Australia was experiencing more extreme heat, longer fire seasons, rising oceans and more marine heatwaves, consistent with a changing climate. A spokeswoman for the publisher Pearson backed the book. “Pearson builds textbooks to support the Australian curriculum and we stand by this text book and its author,” she said. Nonetheless, Stokes said he was writing to Pearson about Kelly’s concerns. “It is very important that texts present information in a balanced way so that students can make up their own minds on important issues,” he said in a statement. Stokes has previously criticised Abbott’s climate change stance, warning against “populist anti-intellectualism” from public figures. The NSW school history curriculum does not specifically mention climate change and there is no mandatory textbook set. While the state government sets the syllabus, it does not write or set the textbooks."
"The White House is planning to assess how climate change impacts national security and will involve a prominent doubter of the scientific consensus that manmade warming is putting the US at risk.  Donald Trump’s staff have drafted an executive order to establish a Presidential Committee on Climate Security, according to reports from the Washington Post and New York Times. It would include senior aide William Happer, a Princeton physicist who has suggested – in conflict with the vast majority of climate scientists – that higher levels of carbon dioxide are beneficial. A recent assessment from the national intelligence director, Daniel Coats, called climate change a significant security risk, the Post noted. Under former president Barack Obama in 2014, the Pentagon said climate change posed “immediate risks” to national security and laid out plans for boosting resilience and readiness as seas rise, disasters intensify and drought exacerbates instability around the world. However, Trump and his cabinet have dismissed several federal government reports that said climate change is worsening and already threatens public health and the economy in the US. “I don’t believe it,” Trump said in November. His agencies have suggested that the reports are based on the worst-case scenario, although the scientists who wrote them said they project what could happen based on current trends. Trump’s former environment administrator, Scott Pruitt, long planned to host debates on climate science but was thwarted by some White House staff. Happer helped create a list of possible participants for that debate, according to emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. In 2017, Happer told the Scientist that climate change research has become a “cult movement”."
"When I see young people all over the world standing up for what they believe in, for the future of the planet and for themselves, it moves me deeply (School pupils call for radical climate action in UK-wide strike, 15 February). The empowerment of young people, particularly in regard to climate change and civic engagement, is at the heart of the YMCA’s raison d’etre. So while it’s a grave topic, the only consoling factor for me is the clear demonstration of these young people’s passion, courage and tenacity. The greatest hope for a better future lies in this kind of attitude from our youth – when they fully engage in civic issues that affect them and their communities we will start to see real change. I hope the success they have already achieved in gaining the world’s attention will motivate them to stick with these issues and work towards their goals. I feel uplifted because they are realising their power and potential to make a difference. This is how the leaders of tomorrow will be shaped, and they will do better than the leaders of today.  We can’t predict exactly how the future will look if the current lack of action continues, but we know it doesn’t look good. Of course these kids are scared. Of course they’re outraged at those in power who have allowed political self-interest and short-term objectives to blind them. So as the secretary general of the World Alliance of YMCAs, I want to officially congratulate these young people and let them know that the YMCA supports you wholeheartedly. We back your cause and applaud your initiative to take the lead where elected leaders have failed. We join you in calling on decision-makers to take real definitive action on climate change now.Carlos SanveeSecretary general of the World Alliance of YMCAs • “The 20 hottest years on record have all happened within the past 22 years; the five hottest were the last five.” These are the scariest words I have read in the Guardian for a long time, and there have been some strong contenders.

"After Scott Morrison’s announcement of his new climate change policy we know two things – the government still thinks we’re idiots, and they are still not serious about reducing emissions. I guess we should be grateful that at least the government now realises it needs to look as if it gives a damn about reducing emissions, because for a while they couldn’t even be bothered to do that. But stuff it. I’m done with giving out prizes for pretence. I’m done with being satisfied with something not even worthy of being called a fourth-best policy. I’m done with the lies. Do not for one second think this is a policy designed to reduce emissions. It is a political Band-Aid while the actual wound to our economy from its greenhouse gas dependency is open and festering. It is a fraud, and not even a new one. It’s the same bulldust that the Liberal National party has been selling the public for nigh on a decade with a different badge. Gone is the Emissions Reduction Fund; say hello to the “Climate Solutions Fund”. This fund of $2bn over 10 years is not just a rebranding of Tony Abbot’s Direct Action, it is actually a diminishment of it. At $200m a year on average it is less than half the money a year that was spent on Direct Action – a policy that was so laughably bad that a government with any level of shame would quietly have dumped it and pretended it never happened. Yet, here we are. Nine years after Lenore Taylor ripped apart the Liberal party’s policy of reliance on “soil magic”, we have the prime minister still thinking such measures of carbon sequestration are worth pursuing and will achieve anything close to what is required. But before we go further, let’s bring out the graphs again. First the one showing annual greenhouse gas emissions going back to 2004. You’ve seen it before, it shows that yes, a price on carbon reduces emissions: The next one shows the most recent projections for our emissions. These are the government’s own figures. And they show we are a long way from being on target to reduce emissions by either 26% or 28% below 2005 levels: So we have that reality, but the prime minister says we will meet the target “in a canter”. Why? Because our target will also include “carryover credits” which comes from exceeding our Kyoto reduction commitment. That might be defensible if our Kyoto commitment did not already include some dodgy work involving the counting of land use, land-use change and forestry, which allowed us to reach our target even if we actually increased our emissions. It means we are using dodgy counting of previous dodgy counting to meet our targets. The University of Melbourne’s Dylan McConnell estimates over half of the reduction will come via this trick accounting method, while 15% will come via “technology improvements and other sources of abatement” which is code for, “dunno, but here’s hoping someone does something good, in spite of our efforts”. But you don’t really need to be told the ins and outs of this policy. You know it is a terrible joke on us all – the suggestion that we can do what is needed on climate change by spending a mere $200m a year. With annual GDP of around $1,950bn, that represents just 0.01% this year, and because our GDP will grow, by 2030, $200m will be a mere 0.006% of GDP. Now let us look at our emissions compared with other nations in the OECD: Yes, the United States emits a lot more than we do, but when you look at per capita and per GDP you see how integral greenhouse gas emissions are to our economy. Australia is basically the most carbon-dependent economy in the OECD. It means it is going to be tougher for us to reduce our emissions than it is for other nations. Yet the government would have you believe it can all be done painlessly. Just write a cheque for a mere $200m a year – less than is spent on SBS each year, and we’re done? Do you really think that governments around the world have been avoiding action on climate change for the past three decades because they would have to spend this pathetic amount? If that was all that was needed, we wouldn’t even be worrying. It would have been done. The reality is cutting emissions is going to be tough. We are finally paying the bill for 200 years of gorging on carbon for free; and the bill is large. We need to be honest about this. If it was easy – anywhere near as easy as what Scott Morrison or Tony Abbott or Josh Frydenberg would have you believe – it would have already been done. The reason it hasn’t is because it is bloody hard. But it needs to happen and I have a few graphs to illustrate why. First, the average annual temperature over the past 60 years: Remember when all the climate-change deniers (for deniers they are) said 1998 was the hottest year and the planet had not warmed since then? Well the temperature anomaly of the past five years have averaged almost 40% more than what was reached in that year. What if we extrapolated out the 20-year trend since 1998 into the future? If we use an absurdly conservative linear trend we reach 2C above pre-industrial levels by 2066 – just 47 years time. But if we use a more realistic exponential trend line, we get there by 2049. A point at which my 15-year-old daughter would be the same age I am now: Enough with the lies and fraudulent policy. It is beyond time for politicians to be honest with us. Action on climate change will be tough, and we need to stop pretending it can be done with ease. What we don’t need is this current putrid policy from the government. They have shown they cannot get serious about the issue; it’s time they got out of the way. Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia."
"Teachers will follow on the heels of striking students on Friday with a protest to demand the national curriculum be reformed to make the climate and ecological crisis an educational priority. The Extinction Rebellion group will support the demonstration outside the Department for Education, which organisers describe as a “peaceful nonviolent protest that may involve civil disobedience”. It is intended as a show of solidarity for pupils who skipped classes last Friday to express their frustration at the failure of older generations to adequately address climate change. Organisers said more than 10,000 young people in at least 60 towns and cities in the UK joined the strike. More would be likely to follow, they said, if the government did not live up to a Paris climate agreement promise to enhance climate change education. Instead, they say, there is currently no requirement for children to be taught about the climate crisis so it is treated, at best, as a peripheral subtopic of subjects like geography and science. They are also unhappy that part of the curriculum appears to cast doubt on the evidence for man-made climate change, even though governments, the UN and the overwhelming majority of scientists accept that it is happening. Government guidelines for key stage 4 chemistry say pupils should be taught “evidence, and uncertainties in evidence, for additional anthropogenic causes of climate change”. Tim Jones, a secondary school teacher from Lewisham, said students in the state system could easily go through 11 years of compulsory education and hear climate change mentioned in fewer than 10 lessons out of approximately 10,000. Given the scale of the crisis, he believes this is “negligent”. “Climate and ecological breakdown will define the life of every child and student alive today. They and we are facing an unimaginable catastrophe. But when I tell my students, it’s hard for them to take me seriously when it plays almost no part in the content of their education,” he said. Earlier this month, the group Teachers for Climate Truth wrote to the DfE to request an overhaul of the current curriculum to prepare children for a future that will be shaped by ecological and climate crisis “When we have had the evidence for decades, why does it amount to little more than a footnote in our national curriculum – a vague and marginal concern?” asks the letter. “If we keep this information out of the public domain – out of schools, for example – perhaps we might avoid some awkward conversations in the years to come … after all, who wants to tell a child that, unless we make unprecedented changes to how we live, we are heading for societal collapse, famine, war and the increasing likelihood of human extinction?” The picture is not black and white. There is considerable scope for schools and teachers to go beyond guidelines. The government said the current curriculum already included many related issues including classes on seasonal changes, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, eco-systems, the composition of the atmosphere and the impact of carbon dioxide on the climate. “Children are very engaged, otherwise they would not be joining protests. That shows they are obviously being taught quite well,” said a government official. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, has criticised the young strikers. “Missing class won’t do a thing to help the environment; all they will do is create extra work for teachers,” he said. Friday’s demonstration is expected to draw between 100 and 200 teachers and academics, most of whom are on half-term holiday. Organisers are also in talks with unions to discuss how to increase support during the next global youth climate strike on 15 March, with possibilities ranging from a walkout by teachers to the setting of homework on climate topics. Extinction Rebellion will also offer workshops for students. Elsewhere, the stakes are growing. In Australia – which has seen waves of school walkouts in recent months – the New South Wales education minister, Rob Stokes, warned students and teachers that they will be punished if they skip classes to join a global climate rally on 15 March. The initiator of the school strike movement, Greta Thunberg, responded with a defiant tweet. “OK. We hear you. And we don’t care. Your statement belongs in a museum.” Last week, 200 academics expressed support for the youth activists in an open letter on the Guardian. Among the signatories was Alison Green, a doctor of psychology who resigned from her position as pro-vice chancellor of Arden University so that she could concentrate on climate activism. She will join the protest on Friday. “It’s incredibly brave for schoolchildren to confront what must be a terrifying prospect; that the future they hope for isn’t available to them,” she said. “We’ve been humbled that children have gone on strike despite threats of detentions and other punishments. We should at least match their courage.”"
"It doesn’t surprise me that the environmental justice movement began in the south, a place where, historically, the pressure of injustice builds until it explodes into organized resistance. The Warren, North Carolina, protests of 1982 are considered one of the earliest examples of the environmental justice movement. A manufacturer of electrical transformers dumped tons of cancer-causing PCB waste along 240 miles of North Carolina’s highways. When it came time for the clean up, the North Carolina government chose Warren – a small, predominantly African American town – for the toxic waste facility. There were weeks of protests and over 500 arrests. It was an awakening, showing the country that race and class play a part in who has to live near toxic waste. I spoke with Almena Myles, one of the protesters. Even 30 years later, the incident has left a mark. “I learned why we were targeted. They chose us because we were rural and poor and they thought we couldn’t fight it,” she told me. “They thought we wouldn’t understand. It was a crash course in advocacy. We felt we had stepped back in time, like it was the 1960s all over again and we had to fight for our rights as if it was the civil rights movement.” These are, unfortunately, not just corporate practices of the past. Today, Louisiana’s impoverished river communities are polluted by big oil and companies, creating the so-called “Cancer Alley”. Pahokee, Florida, a town whose population is 56% African-American and 29% Hispanic, has had to confront the sugar industry, which polluted nearby Lake Okeechobee, endangering drinking water, fish safety, and property values. Paper mills have polluted Africatown, Alabama. Burlington Industries dumped cancer-causing PCBs in Cheraw, South Carolina. There’s toxic coal ash in Uniontown, Alabama. The list goes on and on. In January, I travelled to Mississippi to meet Heather McTeer Toney, an Obama appointee to the Environmental Protection Agency and the first black mayor of Greenville, Mississippi. On her mind were the minority communities on the frontlines of climate change disasters in the south. “Immediate action is required, and we can’t just have the conversations in Washington,” she said. “Citizens need to step into roles to protect themselves from what’s coming. The government isn’t agile enough.” An estimated 70% of the country’s contaminated waste sites are located near low-income housing, and an Associated Press analysis suggests 2 million people live within a mile of one of the 327 Superfund sites vulnerable to climate change-related flooding, most of them in low-income communities and communities of color. The south-east, particularly North Carolina and Virginia, is notorious for its coal ash deposits, spills, and anti-regulation mentality. People of color have outsized exposure to coal ash pollution, which contains carcinogens like mercury, lead, and arsenic. The EPA estimates that 1.5 million people of color live in areas vulnerable to contamination. I decided to visit Virginia to learn more and arrived in February, Black History Month. Governor Ralph Northam was on a listening tour following his blackface photo scandal, and a bill allowing local governments to determine the future of Confederate monuments had just been easily defeated, 6-2. I wondered: if Virginia is still fighting culture battles, how can it address the imminent threats of climate change effectively and protect all its citizens? Norfolk, Virginia, is one of the most flood-prone cities on the east coast. Through a grant from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, the city is piloting advanced resilience measures like micro-grids, oyster reef restoration, green stormwater management, and a “People First Initiative” that sets aside money to help the displaced. However, some of the actions meant to help low-income residents – like moving people out of flood-prone housing – raise questions of gentrification. For example, a public housing neighborhood called Tidewater Gardens will soon be razed to make way for a mixed-use project. The Norfolk city councilman Paul Riddick feels that the initiative is yet another example of urban gentrification that excludes non-white contractors, and of the generational transfer of wealth. Though Northam recently encouraged bipartisan legislation requiring Virginia’s Dominion Power Company to excavate and clean up its ash ponds, citizens will fund the $5bn cleanup bill, not the company. Furthermore, Dominion is pursuing a pipeline project that would place a pollution-generating compressor station in the historic black community of Union Hill. While in Virginia, I visited Rick Middleton in Charlottesville to learn more about the history of environmental justice in the south. Middleton is an Alabama-born lawyer and founder of the Southern Environmental Law Center, one of the largest environmental law organizations in the world. Its work has been instrumental in coal ash cleanup across the south, and it has sought to help communities of color such as Union Hill, Virginia, and Walnut Tree, North Carolina, challenge industrial pollution. I asked him why he started the organization. “I was idealistic,” he said. “And I believe in justice.” Virginia’s current ethical race-based fumbles are stereotypical of what people expect from the south. What outsiders don’t always expect are the intelligent and passionate movements that grow in response to systematic injustice here. “Why did you come back to the south?” I asked Middleton, wondering why he chose to open the SELC in Charlottesville. “Yale Law School was my first time in the north-east,” he said. “Because of my Alabama accent, people assumed I was an ignorant southerner, and it made me want to identify even more as a southerner.” He witnessed what he felt was a lack of interest from major environmental groups. “They didn’t know the area or think they could raise money down here,” he said. At the time, air pollution was a serious problem, and there was a clear need for the enforcement of standards. Middleton thought he could help. “Advocacy is essential,” Middleton continued, ”but you cannot succeed at environmental protection without lawyers, especially when you’re up against political power and resources.” I asked what it was like working against conservative ideology in the south. “It wasn’t always that way,” Middleton explained. “When we first started, people wanted clean air. The environment wasn’t politicized. We had public opinion behind us.” In the late 70s and early 80s, Middleton told me, companies weren’t savvy about environmental laws, and winning cases was easier. Eventually, companies began to staff their own environmental lawyers, and then came the Reagan administration, which strengthened the conservative ideology that still persists in the south today: that government is the enemy, and regulation prevents prosperity. Those ardently opposed to regulation might ask themselves how much they trust corporations to keep their air and drinking water clean. They might review the sheer number of Superfund sites that sat in the path of Hurricane Florence, and consider that the burden of cleanup costs often falls on taxpayers instead of the polluting companies. Combined, the six southern states the SELC represents, Middleton tells me, would be the eighth-largest contributor of greenhouse gases in the world. It isn’t a region environmentalists can afford to ignore. Despite working against the political grain, the SELC has taken energy cases to the supreme court, resulting in the largest power plant cleanup in history. They’ve cleaned up coal-fired power, resulting in a 29% decrease in CO2 emissions in the region. The organization has protected millions of acres of land, and prevented uranium mining projects that would have endangered the drinking water of 1.1 million people. I realize that in my 30 years of living in the region, even I took this work for granted. It isn’t fast or glamorous – the SELC sometimes spends 10 to 15 years in litigation. When Middleton and I walk two blocks from his office to the Charlottesville mall, a city center lined with shops, Middleton points first to an independent bookstore he loves, and second to the place where, a year ago, a white supremacist murdered the protester Heather Heyer with his car. Environmental advocates, like those at SELC, are working across a divided nation. “I had no idea it would become as partisan as it is today. It has gotten so bad,” Middleton says. “People will tell me, ‘You’re not so bad for an environmentalist.’ Tell me - how did the idea of caring about the environment become leftwing political ideology?” We both acknowledge that climate change is going to make things worse. “It’s a slow, insidious process,” he says. “America is a crisis society – we don’t pay attention to anything until there’s a real crisis.” If companies are not held responsible for the pollution they cause, and the government does not act to protect all citizens, we may have several crises to choose from."
"Despite being barely two years old, the Sunrise Movement has outpaced established environmental groups in the push to radically reshape the political landscape around climate change. Closely allied with new congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youth-led Sunrise Movement has helped set out a sweepingly ambitious plan to address climate change in the form of the Green New Deal. The movement comprises a small core team of young organizers, supported by a larger group of several hundred volunteers. The group’s elevation of the Green New Deal has clearly riled Trump, who has falsely but repeatedly claimed that the plan would result in the banning of cars, air travel and even cows. The Guardian spoke to Sunrise members on how the organization has shaken the political and environmental establishment in the US. Photograph by Charlotte Kesl/The Guardian A few days after Trump won, I just felt super radicalized. I couldn’t believe that climate change was happening and people were pretending as if we weren’t on this downward spiral. So I went to school wearing a sign that said “Climate change is real.” My teacher is a huge environmental activist and she told me about Sunrise. I took the fall semester off from school to volunteer full time with them, working on the midterm elections in Orlando, Florida. We were knocking on a lot of doors, talking to people about the candidates that we endorse because they had either signed the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge or had climate policy. Fossil fuel money in our politics is the main obstacle to climate policy, in my opinion. There’s only so much that public opinion can do if the politicians are bought out by fossil fuel billionaires and executives. When you look at the polling of public opinion on climate change and the Green New Deal specifically, it’s clear that the public is already with us on this issue, it’s just a matter of turning passive supporters into active supporters. I feel like young people have always played the role of moral clarity and being willing to be idealists about what the world should be like. I see my generation as picking up the baton from young people in the 1960s and in the civil rights movement who engaged in similar efforts. We totally see our struggle as rooted in the past activism of young people. Photograph by Alex Welsh/The Guardian I grew up next to the ocean in the Bay Area. I was so sure I would become a marine biologist up until two years ago. Studying marine animals is my passion. But as I was walking along the beach year after year I realised the animals I was trying to study were disappearing faster than I could study them, which was really scary. I learned about climate change when I was 12, doing a report on the Canadian seal hunt, and I realized it was one of these issues that you can’t note and do nothing. Doing nothing is a death sentence to my generation I had to get political. I’m Jewish, my (extended) family was in the Holocaust. I was brought with the belief that if you become aware of something, you have a responsibility to take action. In 10 or 11 years, when climate change is irreversible, I’m going to be trying to have kids or get married … that definitely changes the way I can talk about this issue. This is literally my future and you doing nothing is a death sentence to my generation. Even with young people, there’s always this tendency to want to compromise, to want to talk to people and come to an agreement. That’s a really hard thing to step away from. What we found in Sunrise is that drawing a line in the sand is something that needs to be done sometimes. We can’t have a compromise on stopping climate change – we either stop it or don’t. You should be a little bit scared if you haven’t endorsed the Green New Deal, because young people aren’t going to vote for you. We aren’t going to be behind you, You can’t claim to be environmentalist if you don’t do this. That’s the line we’re drawing, which is really helpful. Photograph by Gabriel Scarlett/The Guardian I grew up in eastern Kentucky. There, I couldn’t escape the generational poverty caused by the fossil fuel industry. A lot of my friends’ parents were unemployed, there were no coalmining jobs. But we’ve known that the end of coal was coming for awhile. When my mom moved to eastern Kentucky 30-plus years ago, people told her that there were only 30 years left of coal in these mountains. But no one made any preparations. Instead, they just started to deny, and people sunk deeper into poverty. So by the time I was a child, these families had barely enough food to put on their table because they weren’t receiving Black Lung benefits, because they had family members who had died in the mines. I even had friends who were turning to opioids because they were so disenfranchised, discouraged and dismayed that they were going to end up like their parents. People are not climate deniers because they don’t believe in facts, people are climate deniers because they’re so afraid that they cannot confront another thing that is going to put them deeper into poverty. Climate change is something that disproportionately impacts my generation. We’re feeling the burden of it, so it makes sense that I would care the most. But I think it’s really difficult to get politicians and legislators to take our voices seriously, especially because they believe that we do not have any voting power. I think there’s a misconception that we’re advocating for something that’s unattainable, that we are throwing ourselves out there, that we’re becoming extreme, when we’re not. We are advocating for what is necessary to ensure that I have a livable future at all. Photograph by Jared Soares/The Guardian Sometimes it’s hard because people don’t take us seriously. A lot of us who are going to be most heavily impacted by climate change can’t vote. I couldn’t vote until six months ago. We want to be part of the debate which we’ve been excluded from because we don’t have the money to buy in to elect politicians who will back us. When politicians don’t listen and don’t represent us, we have the ability to say, “OK, we’re going to show up at your office.” We’re telling them to go, go, go because we don’t have time to do it any other way I was there that night when Scott Wagner called Rose Strauss “young and naive”. It was so defeating for me. The next day, it was like “Oh my God, it’s happening.” It picked up steam, and then we were so energized and excited. Not everyone’s story will go viral. But the more stories we have, it’s like a moral, emotional, value-driven path forward for our country. My official role is helping to put on a tour for the Green New Deal. We’re taking the Green New Deal to every city and town across America, first in seven or eight flagship stops in places that represent real political leadership or really devastating climate impact or economic inequality. We’re giving anyone who wants to do this the blueprint, and we’re telling them to go, go, go because we don’t have time to do it any other way. Photograph by Tony Luong/The Guardian The first thing that I saw looking out of the airplane window [when I moved to the US] was just how green Boston was. I saw all the trees, the bushes lining the sidewalks. It was a really stark contrast from Tehran. My family and I used to go hiking in the hills behind my Tehran house and once we got to the summit, we just saw this almost gray canvas covering the city. Looking up, we saw the blue sky. It made me realize that it could be different. With a little more government regulation, awareness and action, we could change the way the city looks and feels. The movement really has grown since it’s started out. Just looking back in November, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came out with the Green New Deal. Sunrise was able to send hundreds of people to Washington DC to support her and advocate for the Green New Deal. Senator Ed Markey has been really helpful and the Massachusetts lead on supporting the Green New Deal. Just a few days ago, Sunrise actually took to his office to thank him and his staffers for their support. The only legislator left on the lower level for Massachusetts is Representative Richard Neal. Currently, Sunrise is at his office, asking him to sign on. It really is too late to have a debate on whether or not climate change is a hoax, especially when we’re already seeing people suffering the consequences; my heart goes out to all those people that have their school torn down or their houses broken because of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. If our leaders aren’t willing to really address the crisis that we’re facing right now, then they need to be replaced. People say that young people are naive or too inexperienced but every time we get something done, we prove that we aren’t that stereotype. We may be young, but we are not naive. We understand the real-life consequences of climate change on our present and future, and we’ve decided to do something about it. • This article was amended on 4 March 2019 to correct a reference to Senator Ed Markey."

"The UK is experiencing its warmest February day on record and some of the highest temperatures ever recorded in winter, according to forecasters. Temperatures in Trawsgoed, Wales, reached 20.3C, (68.5F) on Monday morning and rose to 20.6C in the afternoon. The previous highest recorded temperature in February had been 19.7C in London in 1998.  It is the first time temperatures have exceed 20C during winter, according to a Met Office official. The weather starkly contrasts with the beginning of the month, when sub-zero temperatures were recorded across the country. The Met Office’s chief meteorologist, Steve Willington, emphasised that the gap was notable, saying: “By the weekend we could see temperatures almost 10 degrees higher than what we might normally expect at this time of year, so there will certainly be a spring-like feel in the air across the country. “North-western parts of the UK will be wet and windy at times this week, but settled conditions will spread to all parts of the country by the weekend, bringing plenty of sunshine and unseasonably mild temperatures that could well compete with current February temperature records.” Responding to the Met Office reports, the Green party MP, Caroline Lucas, said the warmer temperatures were concerning. She added: “I like spending an afternoon in the sunshine as much as anyone, but it’s impossible to shake the feeling that this isn’t right. After last year’s unprecedented global heatwave and last month’s deadly temperatures in Australia, our baseline perception of what’s normal is shifting. “We are living through climate breakdown and, instead of taking urgent action, ministers carry on as if nothing has changed. The government must wake up to this crisis, urgently declare a climate emergency and introduce a ‘Green New Deal’ to provide a green job to everyone who wants one and transform our economy to prevent climate catastrophe.” A Met Office representative said that temperatures in Wales were affected by local geography, with southerly winds rising over the east of the Welsh mountains and warming while descending down the other side in west Wales. The country is experiencing warmer temperatures in general this week. London reached 19.8C on Monday – also the highest temperature recorded in February since records began. This time last year there was widespread snowfall across the country between late February and March and some areas of the country were hit by blizzards. Bob Ward, of the centre for climate change economics and policy at the London School of Economics, said that while warmer temperatures are often welcomed, they can be deadly. “People may find it very pleasant to be in warmer temperatures but they must also remember that it’s the same trend that saw hundreds of people die last summer as a result of overheating. “Over the last five years we also had two record wet winters during which there was severe flooding. This is a sign of the fundamental and profound way that Britain’s climate is changing.” He said the weather change could also have disastrous consequences for wildlife. “If we have a cold [snap again] now there is a danger it will kill a lot of wildlife that has emerged early due to the spring-like temperatures.” The spell of warm weather is expected to continue over the weekend, and bookmakers are offering odds of 5-2 that this summer will be the hottest on record."
"It’s a fantastic time for verbal abuse in American politics. Donald Trump loves a schoolyard nickname, insulting everyone from “Crazy Bernie” Sanders to “Little Marco” Rubio. In turn, the president’s opponents, and sometimes his allies, have called him a moron, a motherfucker and mocked his tiny hands. But is there a way of using name-calling, not just to insult, but to introduce a new political idea. It seemed like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was doing that this week when she used the term “climate delayer” to call out those dragging their feet on climate change. Ocasio-Cortez used the term to describe Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was filmed telling a bunch of children that when it comes to the looming apocalypse, she knows better than they do, because she has spent a long time in the Senate not fixing the problem. While they called for immediate action on the Green New Deal, she argued that change wasn’t going to come anytime soon. After all, when it comes to averting a global catastrophe on an unprecedented scale, endangering hundreds of millions and fundamentally altering the human experience, you don’t want to rush into things. The clip went viral. In the ensuing days, Ocasio-Cortez warned on Instagram and Twitter of the threat of “climate delayers”: people who appear to accept that something needs to be done about climate change, but don’t seem to grasp its urgency. These people, she pointed out, aren’t much better than people who deny climate change exists. Climate delayers aren’t much better than climate deniers.With either one if they get their way, we’re toast. https://t.co/Do0WJRfG56 The term isn’t entirely new. “Global warming delayer” appeared on sites like ThinkProgress more than a decade ago; it appeared in the Guardian at least as far back as 2011. And out of context, it sounds like a badge of honor. A climate denier denies climate change, so a climate delayer … delays it? Like by buying a Prius? But that’s getting into the weeds: we should celebrate the phrase’s emergence in mainstream political debate. Trump’s political success has proven that a label can be as effective as a thousand nuanced arguments. Sure, “Delayin’ Feinstein” might not have quite the same ring as “Lyin’ Ted”, but it’s getting there. And given the scale of the issue, we badly need an arsenal of labels for people standing in the way of climate progress. Labels for people who reject the scientific evidence of climate change have a tortured history. A debate has raged as to whether “climate denier” or “climate skeptic” should be used to describe such people, the latter term aiming to soothe the egos of officials who just aren’t quite sure they can believe basically every scientist. Scientists who consider themselves genuine skeptics – in the sense of seeking “scientific inquiry, critical investigation and the use of reason in examining controversial and extraordinary claims” – didn’t like the term “skeptics” for people who rejected expertise; they wanted to call them deniers, according to the Associated Press, purveyors of one of journalism’s leading style guides. But those “deniers”, understandably, didn’t like the language’s resemblance to Holocaust denial. So in 2015, the AP put forward another option, “climate doubters”, advising writers to ditch “deniers” and “skeptics” entirely. The Guardian’s own style guide takes a different view: “The OED defines a sceptic as ‘a seeker of the truth; an inquirer who has not yet arrived at definite conclusions’. Most so-called ‘climate change sceptics’, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, deny that climate change is happening, or is caused by human activity, so denier is a more accurate term.” On top of all that, there are “climate contrarians”, who make it their business to fight the scientific consensus – “often with substantial financial support from fossil fuels industry organizations and conservative thinktanks,” as summarized in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And yet none of these labels have managed to target a fundamental obstacle to climate change action: powerful people who profess to understand climate change, yet are curiously immobile on the issue. Perhaps the popularization of “delayer” will finally put the pressure on. When it comes to politically productive name-calling, it’s a lot snappier to dismiss someone as a “climate delayer” than to chastise them as a “person who apparently believes the science but is unwilling to acknowledge the urgency of the situation”. It’s worth noting in all this that the very phrase “climate change” is mired in labelling warfare. As anyone who has seen the movie Vice knows, the Republican pollster Frank Luntz encouraged the George W Bush administration to use the phrase “climate change” rather than “global warming”. Yale researchers recount a secret memo in which he pointed out that a focus group participant felt “climate change ‘sounds like you’re going from Pittsburgh to Fort Lauderdale’,” whereas “global warming has catastrophic connotations”. Perhaps if we’d all stuck with “global warming” – or even tried “global heating” – concern would have grown faster. Luntz knows messaging: he turned the estate tax into the “death tax” and health reform into a “government takeover” of healthcare. Fortunately in Ocasio-Cortez, it seems the left has a messaging expert of its own. And whether denier or delayer, she points out, “if they get their way, we’re toast”."
"Don’t eat yellow snow has always been good advice. To that we can now add warnings against green, pink, orange and black snow, as new evidence of our trashing of the planet is now being etched out on the most pristine of environments – our dwindling snow caps. A spate of incidents in Russia has grabbed internet attention. Residents of Siberian towns watched with dismay as the snow around them turned green and black, with toxic emissions forcing some to wear masks. These seem to be connected to local factories, with a chrome plant in particular behind the green snow, and, as protests gather pace, the Putin government has come under pressure.  Snow pollution is not new. Campaigners have been warning for years of the dangers of dark snow, – black, brown and grey streaks across the ice that can be clearly seen from the air above Arctic regions – because of its effects on climate change. Dark snow is stained by black carbon, AKA soot – unburnt particles released by the combustion of fossil fuels in coal-fired power plants, factories and other sources, and carried to the ice caps on the wind. When soot falls on white snow, it is not only an aesthetic disaster: reflective snow and ice enhance the earth’s albedo ((the ability of a surface to reflect sunlight), bouncing light and heat back into space, but dark snow absorbs heat instead, accelerating global warming. Eliminating soot could slow climate change, helping to reduce temperatures by up to 0.5C. Snow is sometimes stained by natural phenomena. Chlamydomonas nivalis algae can make it appear pink or red, an effect documented by scientists since the 19th century. Orange snow spreading across eastern Europe last year may have been from particles of dust and sand from the Sahara, though pollution was a more likely cause of orange snowfalls in Siberia a decade earlier. As far as eating snow goes, don’t try the white stuff. Researchers in Canada found in 2017 that melting urban snow releases a cocktail of toxic chemicals, largely from car exhausts, trapped in the snow from polluted air. Snow in its beauty has always exercised a hold over our imaginations, symbolising purity and transcendence, harking back to a mythical state of innocence. As the snow around us stains black, grey, brown, green and the rest, there could hardly be a more potent emblem of our runaway global problem with pollution."
"Thousands of pupils walked out of their classrooms on the Friday before half-term to protest against the lack of action on climate change. Though many headteachers privately support the strike, the issue has divided the school community. In a letter to the Guardian, more than 200 academics backed the students’ stand, but the two headteacher unions said it was disruptive for schools and raised safeguarding issues. So should pupils have time off to protest?  professor of education, Cambridge University “Yes, definitely. I’d like to think that had I still been teaching in a school, I would have taken a stand and gone on strike in support. The older generation has really let young people down with short-termism and by prioritising self-interest, and I think young people in the UK lack opportunities for democratic engagement. “Most of those involved in the strike are too young to have a vote. Protesting is one of the very few ways in which they can take political action and be part of a participatory democracy. I encouraged my niece to go and she came back full of enthusiasm, and also much better informed about the state of the environment. Some people have argued that children are missing out on learning. Well, I think it’s a positive learning experience to come together collectively in a common cause.”  executive headteacher, Harrogate grammar school, and president of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) “No. I don’t agree with pupils taking strike action as a protest against climate change. The cause is vital to humanity and I feel personal shame that my generation has allowed this crisis to happen on our watch. But a pupil strike is not the right approach. Each day’s learning is important for their life chances and their potential to go out and change the world. Schools are also in loco parentis and it is a concern if pupils are off site. “We had a small number of very able and principled students let us know they planned to take strike action. Colleagues met them and explained why this was difficult for the school to support as we would struggle with our duty to keep them safe. The head and deputy voiced their support for the cause and showed them what the school was doing to respond to the challenge of climate change. We are not aware of any students who were absent because of strike action.”​ A-level student, Brighton, Hove and Sussex sixth-form college “Yes, we should be allowed time off. I think if you care passionately about something enough that it makes you want to go on strike, you should be able to. “I say that as someone who values my education, especially right now, with my A-level exams coming up. Missing a day of sixth form meant a lot to me – it was very costly for me to go when I am right in the middle of revising for my mocks – but I think it was important the strike took place during the school term. If it had not, it would not have been so impactful or controversial. “I have heard people arguing that young people went on strike to get out of school. Those people are not taking us seriously, they are not taking the issue of climate change seriously, and that attitude is part of the reason why we went on strike. When I read the statistics about global warming and what is going to happen in the future, I don’t think enough is being done by older people. If I can do something to make a difference, even if it’s just making everyone around me aware that I’m concerned, then I’m going to jump at that. If older people don’t want us to strike, they need to act. “My parents signed me out of college along with my younger brother, who is in secondary school, so they took responsibility for ‘safeguarding’ us that day. I know other young people whose parents didn’t want them going, and schools that didn’t allow it. And those young people felt silenced.”  head, Heathfield community college, East Sussex “I’d like to say yes, but I’m struggling. A school cannot authorise absence for this purpose. A parent can withdraw their child, but must be willing to accept the consequence of a fine. Headteachers rightly have safeguarding concerns for those who miss school yet whose whereabouts are unknown in uncoordinated events such as Friday’s marches.  “However, I believe peaceful, powerful protest has a valuable place in a civilised, democratic society; much good has historically come from it. Teenagers must be able to form, express and share their views. Adults need to listen to young people. They are voters of the future and dismissing or patronising their actions and views now may be something politicians later regret.” head, Sibford school, Banbury, Oxfordshire “Yes. The school community felt very strongly about the strike and I was happy to authorise the absences of those who wanted to take part. I sense a great deal of exasperation from children that political leaders of the world today seem to be unable or unwilling to take decisive and unilateral action on climate change. Instant gratification and myopic political point-scoring blindly trumps all. “As the head of a Quaker school that takes its responsibility towards the environment seriously, I believe it is incumbent upon us to support the children of today in making their voices heard. What is education about? If we do not have a planet to live on, then there is not a lot of point in learning about Pythagoras or Shakespeare.  “Whatever the debate about climate change, there is clear and troubling scientific evidence, which cannot be ignored. Many children rightly have a sense of urgency and they absolutely should have a voice.”"

"The EU should double its climate change reduction targets to do its fair share in keeping the planet below a dangerous level of global warming, the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has told political and business leaders in Brussels. Flanked by students from the Belgian and German school strike movements, the Swedish teenager said it was not enough to hope that young people were going to save the world. “There is simply not enough time to wait for us to grow up and become the ones in charge,” she said, citing the fall in greenhouse gas emissions that was needed by 2020. The EU wants to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. “Some people say that is good, that is ambitious; but this new target is still not enough to keep global warming below 1.5C,” Thunberg said, referring to what scientists regard as the preferable upper limit if the planet is to avoid extreme droughts, floods and the bleaching of corals.  “This target is not sufficient to protect the future for children growing up today. If the EU is to make its fair contribution to stay within the carbon budget for the 2C limit then it needs a minimum of 80% reduction by 2030, and that includes aviation and shipping.” Thunberg, whose lone school strike last September became the catalyst for a global movement, was applauded by the audience of political, business and civil society leaders, despite her uncompromising message that the older generation was failing those of the future. She also responded to criticism from political leaders, who included Theresa May, over skipping lessons. “If you still say that we are wasting valuable lesson time, then let me remind you that our political leaders have wasted decades through denial and inaction.” Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, followed her address with a sprawling speech across a variety of green topics including EU climate policy, his love of Europe’s varied landscapes and opposition to the harmonisation of toilet flushes. Juncker said he had rejected his civil servants’ proposal for an energy-saving measure on toilets because the EU needed to focus on economic problems and external threats. Speaking to journalists after the event, Thunberg said it was sad Juncker had not said much about the climate crisis, while revealing her own frustration about the reaction to the school strike movement. In August 2018 Thunberg began a solo climate protest by striking from school in Sweden when aged 15. She has since been joined by tens of thousands of school and university students in Australia, Belgium, Germany, the United States, Japan and more than a dozen other countries. Speaking at the United Nations climate conference in December 2018, she berated world leaders for behaving like irresponsible children. And in January 2019 she rounded on the global business elite in Davos: “Some people, some companies, some decision-makers in particular, have known exactly what priceless values they have been sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money. And I think many of you here today belong to that group of people.” Veteran climate campaigners are astonished by what has been achieved in such a short time. Thunberg has described the rapid spread of school strikes for climate around the world as amazing. “It proves you are never too small to make a difference,” she said. Her protests were inspired by US students who staged walk-outs to demand better gun controls in the wake of multiple school shootings. Her mother, Malena Ernman, has given up her international career as an opera singer because of the climate effects of aviation. Her father is actor Svante Thunber. Greta has Asperger’s syndrome, which in the past has affected her health, he says. She sees her condition not as a disability but as a gift which has helped open her eyes to the climate crisis. “When people talk about the climate strikes … they talk about almost anything except for the climate crisis: they talk about whether we are promoting truancy, or whether we are puppets, or it’s great that the young people are taking action. They don’t want to talk about the climate crisis … they just want to change the subject.” She said she planned to continue her strike every Friday until Sweden meets its Paris climate targets."
"An invasive bug with a taste for beans has jumped into the top 10 list of the worst garden pests as it benefited from the warm summer. The Royal Horticultural Society said its latest annual list of which pests and diseases were causing the most trouble in gardens revealed the impact of the hot dry weather in the UK last summer.  The southern green shield bug, which is thought to have been introduced from mainland Europe and was established in Britain in the 2000s, came sixth in 2018’s ranking based on inquiries to the RHS by gardeners. The bug is a sap feeder with some preference for vegetables, particularly beans, and benefited from the warm weather in early summer, the experts said. Young stages of the bug are distinctively black with white or pink markings and an adult looks similar to the harmless native green shield bug, but with no brown marking at its rear. Pear rust is also of growing concern to gardeners, with the fungus that causes orange spots on pear leaves and canker-like swellings on juniper branches becoming very common over the last 16 years, in part due to warmer, drier summers. But the dry conditions helped keep some problems at bay, including leaf spot and canker of Prunus and box blight, which both benefit from warm, wet weather during the growing season. Overall, however, 2018 was another bad year for gardeners with box trees and hedges as box tree caterpillars spread to Wales and Northern Ireland. The caterpillar, which strips box of its leaves, topped the list for the worst pests for the third time, the experts said. Despite the dry conditions, perennial pests slugs and snails were in second place in the ranking of gardener inquiries, while honey fungus topped the list of diseases again in 2018. Matthew Cromey, principal scientist at the RHS, said: “Our pest and disease ranking may be evidence of how climate change is impacting on what we find in our gardens. “With the UK predicted to see wetter winters, warmer summers and more extreme weather events, root diseases of trees and shrubs could become even more problematic and the array of pests is likely to change. “As the UK faces new plant health problems, it’s imperative that the country has the skills needed to predict, exclude and manage the worst.” The RHS said it was conducting research into several of the most prevalent pests and diseases including the range of slug and snail species in the UK, controls for box tree caterpillar and box blight and improved strategies for managing honey fungus. 1 Box tree caterpillar 2 Slugs and snails 3 Viburnum beetle 4 Vine weevil 5 Woolly aphid 6 Southern green shield bug 7 Fuchsia gall mite 8 Capsid bug 9 Cushion scale 10 Ants 1 Honey fungus 2 Phytophthora root rots 3 Pear rust 4 Volutella blight of box 5 Verticillium wilt 6 Blossom wilt of fruit trees 7 Box blight 8 Kerria twig and leaf blight 9 Leaf spot and canker of Prunus 10 Powdery mildew of Prunus"
"Extreme weather events have been the “main driver” of an olive harvest collapse that could leave Italy dependent on imports from April, a leading climate scientist has warned. A 57% plunge in the country’s olive harvest – the worst in 25 years – sparked protests by thousands of Italian farmers wearing gilet arancioni – orange vests – in Rome earlier this month.  Olive trees across the Mediterranean have been hit by freak events that mirror climate change predictions – erratic rainfalls, early spring frosts, strong winds and summer droughts. Prof Riccardo Valentini, a director of the Euro-Mediterranean Center for climate change, said: “There are clear observational patterns that point to these types of weather extremes as the main drivers of [lower] food productivity.” He added: “Freezing temperatures in the Mediterranean are anomalous for us. In any direction the extremes are important and indeed, they are predicted by climate change scenarios.” Several reports by the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) “all point to these climatic extremes as one of the major impacts of climate change”, he said. “We know there will be more extremes and anomalies in the future.” Valentini said that sudden extremes in any direction – warming or cooling, freezing or drying – can harm plant development. “Three or four days of 40C temperatures in summer, or 10 days without rain in spring – even two days of freezing temperatures in spring – are more important than the average for the year,” he said. Average temperatures in the Mediterranean have already risen by 1.4C above pre-industrial levels – compared with a global average of about 1C – and precipitation has fallen by 2.5%. In the past 18 months, Italy has experienced summer droughts, autumn floods and spring ice waves. Olive trees are weakened by these kinds of weather shocks and, even if they recover, are left more vulnerable to outbreaks of the xylella fastidiosa bacterium and olive fly infestations, which have hit farmers in Italy and Greece, Valentini said. Italy’s Coldiretti farmers’ union estimates that the cost of the olive oil collapse this year has already reached €1bn. “The government promised a solution but it has not given any more resources for the olive farmers,” a Coldiretti spokesman said, adding there was “no plan for [addressing] climate change and olive oil production either.” He said: “We have had demonstrations in front of parliament already and we are waiting for government action.” The spokesman added that if it did not materialise, “there could be more protests”. Beyond Italy, the European commission has projected 2018-19 olive harvests to drop by 20% in Portugal and 42% in Greece, although industry sources said final figures there could be significantly worse. Greek farmers were devastated by extreme drought and then heavy rains, which acted as a “trigger event” for olive fly infestations, according to Valentini. Vasilis Pyrgiotis, the chair of the Copa Cogeca farming union’s olives working group, said: “the big issue is not necessarily the quantity but the quality. Most Greek olive oil is considered ‘extra virgin’ but it is not certain, as time goes by, that this will continue.” Olive oil has to meet organoleptic criteria (such as acidity levels) before it can be classed as extra virgin, and these are affected by growing conditions. “The problem this year was because of fly attacks but also the gloeosporium olivarum fungus,” Pyrgiotis said. “This year’s olives are not as good as they used to be. In the longer term, we face the possibility that they may not be considered as extra virgin oil because of analysis issues.” Olive trees follow a pattern known as alternate bearing, with bad years routinely followed by good. This year, the EU expects Europe’s overall olive basket to be saved by a surge from its biggest producer, Spain. A trend there towards super intensive plantations may partly mitigate climate change impacts, according to Valentini – but at a cost to traditional farming and biodiversity. Fast-growing, high-density olive plantations might be more drought-resistant but water resources could also be limited by these plantations, he said. “It will change the rural landscape from older growth olive trees to more intensive plantations,” he added. “People in the south of Italy are beginning to move in that direction. I don’t like it but I understand it is an adaptation.” A Met Office spokesman said that in future, the combined effect of pests, disease and climate change on global agriculture could be “potentially devastating”."
