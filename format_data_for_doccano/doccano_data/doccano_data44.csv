With the El Niño transitioning to what is called “Neutral Conditions” and then to a weak La Niña by fall, the GWO says weather patterns will change rapidly during the summer and fall – bringing back weather patterns that caused active Atlantic Basin hurricane seasons from 2010 through 2012 – and a much harsher winter in some areas from the United States to parts of Europe and Asia.
An accurate prediction for the year that the California drought cycle will end is available on the GWO web site.
David Dilley, former NOAA meteorologist and now CEO of Global Weather Oscillations says – unlike the past three weak hurricane seasons that were suppressed by hostile atmospheric conditions and the 2015 El Niño – the next few years will be in a “Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle” that will provide very favorable conditions for development of Atlantic Basin tropical storms and hurricanes.
The Atlantic Basin Hurricane Season begins June 1 and averages 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2.5 major hurricanes. Last season (2015) was close to an average season with 12 named storms, 5 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes (includes Hurricane Alex that formed in mid-January). Typically the occurrence of an El Niño during a hurricane season suppresses the number of named storms significantly – but it did not significantly reduce the number of named storms last year, and this is a clear signal for what is in store the next few seasons.
Most dangerous, costly period in 10 years
Mr. Dilley says the combination of the relatively high number of named storms last year, and the El Niño transitioning toward a La Niña during the later portion of this season (2016), signals that a Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle will be in place during the upcoming 2016 season and provide very favorable atmospheric conditions for hurricane development and landfalls during the next couple of years – with this likely being the most dangerous and costly period in over 10 years.

The 2016 season will have 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes.
Three of the GWO United States prediction zones are at high risk for hurricane conditions in 2016, and one zone is at risk for a major impact hurricane. In addition – the 2017 season will be more dangerous and costly than 2016, with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and several of the GWO prediction zones will be at high risk for major impact hurricanes. Over the two year period, GWO expects 5 to 8 United States Hurricane Hot Spots.
Brutal US winter, drought in California
In addition to the change in the weather pattern that will be favorable for the upcoming active hurricane seasons, Mr. Dilley says the 2016-17 winter weather pattern will be dramatically different from last winter in many regions – with the upcoming winter pattern becoming more similar to the one that caused the cold Arctic Vortex outbreaks to plunge southward during the very cold 2014 and 2015 winters and a continuation of the California drought.
The very high Arctic Region that is a production center for cold Arctic air is already responding to the ending of the El Niño, and will likely experience colder than normal temperatures this summer – all of which will once again set the stage for very cold outbreaks in some regions from the United States to Europe and Asia. Detailed hurricane zone predictions, and more detailed regional winter predictions and 2-year Global El Niño and regional predictions can be acquired through the GWO web site.
The GWO researches and develops the “Climate Pulse Technology” (CPT). The CPT prediction model incorporates natural mechanisms that control the rhythm of weather and climate cycles, which in-turn control recurring California drought cycles, winter weather and future hurricane paths.
GWO’s research over the past 30 years has found that each of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal hurricane zones have different cycles, and within each cycle there exists smaller cycles – with each zone having their own unique cycle.  GWO’s so-called Hot Spot predictions for the United States have been nearly 87 percent accurate since 2006, and instrumental for long-range planning by companies and other organizations.

The slightly negative linear trend in global temperature measured by RSS satellite (TLT) continues despite the El-Nino-driven warm 2015.

Source: www.woodfortrees.org trend
This flat trend has held since the end of 1997 and is closing in on two decades – catching a number of scientists by surprise.
The preliminary data from UAH and RSS shows that 2015 was the third warmest year since the measurements began in 1978, and thus did not set a new record. A reanalysis of the global 2m temperature from CFSv2 measured a positive deviation from the mean of 0.27 K, but put the year 2015 only in 6th place:

Note that the poles in the chart have been stretched out and so appear much larger in size than what they actually are. Source: What Causes El Nino Warmth?
This all means that more than half of the satellite measurement era has seen no warming whatsoever!

In Germany according to a DWD press release dated 30 December 2015, the mean temperature for 2015 was 9,9°C and so was the second warmest on record, tied with 2000 and 2007, despite the unusually warm November and December months, which were dominated by mild southerly winds.
Polar ice growth
A big surprise for many has been the ice growth measured in Greenland since 2014. Moreover the Greenland ice sheet has gown some 300 km³ since September 1, 2015 alone:

Top: The total daily contribution to the surface mass balance from the entire ice sheet (blue line, Gt/day). For comparison, the mean curve from the period 1990-2013 is shown (dark grey). The same calendar day in each of the 24 years (in the period 1990-2013) will have its own value. These differences from year to year are illustrated by the light grey band. For each calendar day, however, the lowest and highest values of the 24 years have been left out.” Source: www.dmi.dk/en/greenland-ice-mass-budget/.
It’s also worth taking a look at the surprising NASA-Study here!
The northern hemisphere in November 2015 saw a total of 36.25 million km² of snow cover. That’s about 2.3 million km² above the WMO 1981-2010 mean. It’s the 7th greatest extent since measurements began in 1966.

Northern hemispheric snow cover in November for the 2011 to 2015 five-year period set a new record since measurements began in 1966. The 40-year trend is strongly upwards. Source: http://climate.rutgers.edu/month=11.
In summary the global temperature, polar ice and snow cover trends show no warming taking place, but rather harbor strong signals of cooling.

"The UK has a well-earned reputation for being a key player on the global stage – respected for our record on international development, climate change, and humanitarian aid. By 2020, this country will have helped vaccinate 76 million children, saving 1.4 million lives from preventable diseases. The UK has already helped 57 million people to cope with the effects of climate change over the last eight years and is on track to reach 60 million people with clean water by 2020. About 32 million people have been supported with humanitarian assistance in the face of conflict and disasters, including at least 10 million women and girls.  We should be proud of the role the UK plays in helping people out of poverty around the world, and we ask party leaders to continue to champion this incredible work. Whatever the outcome of this general election, leaders should come together to rise to the ambition of our own and global commitments. If we are to achieve the sustainable development goals by 2030, we must all work together to eradicate poverty, reduce inequality, end violence and exploitation of the most vulnerable and tackle the climate and environment emergency. Delivery of these commitments will require a shift in the way we design government policy at home and abroad so future generations can live in a safe, just, prosperous world where no one is left behind. The next prime minister has an opportunity to show the world what it means to be an outward-facing and progressive nation, a nation that is proud of our official development assistance, with a Department for International Development - represented by its own secretary of state - that delivers for those most in need.

"“The ocean: the largest habitat on Earth” – those words, spoken by Sir David Attenborough at the start of the “prequel” to Blue Planet II, capture the scope, focus, and justification for the BBC Natural History Unit’s latest landmark series.  Over the past two years I’ve been a scientific adviser on some of the topics covered in a couple of episodes, while colleagues at the Open University have been academic partners for the whole series. And lines like that in the prequel can certainly be a head-scratcher for academics like us who fact-check these programmes.  The oceans cover 71% of the surface of the Earth, so seafloor provides the largest area for those species that move about on or are rooted to our planet’s surface – a reasonable justification for the “largest habitat on Earth”. But what about lifeforms that aren’t confined to dry ground or the seabed, those that can swim, fly, drift in wind or currents, or even thrive below the planet’s surface?  The average depth of the ocean is 3,682 metres, so taking 71% of the Earth’s surface with that average depth gives us an estimated volume of 1,332 million km³ for the oceans. And there is life swimming or drifting throughout that vast volume, even to the bottom of the deepest trenches nearly 11km beneath the waves. These trench-dwellers are not the deepest lifeforms on our planet, however, as a “subsurface biosphere” of microbes permeates even further into the Earth’s crust. There are microbes living 2.5km below the ocean floor, for example, in coal-bearing sediments. The depth limit for such subterranean life depends on local geology, however, and even assuming a limit of 2.5km all around the world gives us a “subsurface biosphere” of around 1,275m km³. That’s smaller than the oceans, and furthermore not all that volume is habitable, as the microbes are squeezed into spaces within the rocks.  There are also microbes in atmosphere above our heads, living in water droplets and on ice crystals in thunderclouds, up to an altitude of at least 12km. But before we imagine a layer 12km high for microbial life in the skies, it’s worth remembering that they need a watery environment in which to thrive. Only around 0.4% of our atmosphere is water vapour, so the aerial habitat for microbial life is much smaller than we might think. What about the aerial habitat for birds, bats, flying insects, and tiny animals? Bar-headed geese may fly at an altitude of more than 8km in the Himalayas, but they don’t actually fly 8km above the ground – they follow the terrain of the mountain range as they migrate over it. So it may be wrong to assume a layer 8km high for the aerial habitat of animal life around the world, as there are few mountains rising to those heights. In November 1973, however, an aircraft flying at an altitude of 11km over the Ivory Coast collided with a Rüppell’s Vulture, which holds the record for the highest known bird. As this took place over the coast, with no mountains below, we might therefore assume a layer at least 10km high for animal life in the atmosphere, all over our world, which would give us an astonishing potential habitat of 5,100m km³ for airborne animal life. So at this point, our blue planet is perhaps starting look like a very airy one too. Where the ocean pips it, though, is in the abundance of life that it harbours. Microbes utterly outstrip animals and plants as the dominant form of life on Earth, in their individual numbers and total biomass, so it’s their abundance that matters here. And while living microbes are restricted to watery spots in the atmosphere, they face no such limitation in the ocean. A single millilitre of surface seawater naturally contains around a million living bacteria and other kinds of single-celled microbes. Although that concentration drops off to perhaps 10,000 microbes per millilitre in most of the deep ocean, the total global population of microbes in the oceans is staggering: about 44 octillion living cells (or 44,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 if you prefer). That number is literally beyond astronomical: it’s around ten thousand times the number of stars in the observable Universe. So the oceans are certainly “the largest reservoir of life on Earth”. Is that the same as “the largest habitat on Earth”? The oceans really contain lots of different habitats, of course, from lush kelp forests to huge expanses of open water. Blue Planet II celebrates that reality in its forthcoming episodes, exploring places such as sunlit coral reefs and bizarre deep-sea brine pools, so I’m comfortable with that “largest habitat” shorthand in its opening line. After four years of work by a small army of producers, camera people, sound recordists, editors, researchers, organisers, ship crews, minisub pilots, and scientific advisers, it’s time to immerse ourselves in the wonder – and realise how we are connected to that vast reservoir of life."
"Blue Planet, Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg are all household names bringing information about serious environmental issues to the masses. They’ve helped green issues shoot up the agenda for this year’s general election, with a poll last month revealing that more than half of voters said that the climate emergency would influence how they cast their vote. If it wasn’t for the media these scientific messages wouldn’t be heard or understood by millions of people. And Greta Thunberg’s extraordinary global impact demonstrates her mastery of skills that have little to do with what we usually think of as science.  Her speech to the UN Climate Action summit was utterly different from what we have heard before. In fewer than 500 words, she reduced many in the audience to tears when she said: “You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I’m one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!” Meanwhile, on her trip to the COP25 climate summit in Madrid she sailed with YouTube influencers Sailing La Vagabonde, who have more than 1m subscribers to their channel. Greta is still listening to the science, but she’s using creativity to bring her message to a global audience – and as a result, we’re listening. So isn’t it odd that the arts, and creativity in general, are in freefall in our schools? A report by the Education Policy Institute revealed that with government education reforms pushing pupils towards traditional academic subjects in schools, there is a marked reduction in the number of people aged 14-16 taking subjects such as dance and fine art. Fewer pupils studying arts and humanities at A-level has led to a decline in students applying to study similar subjects at degree level. While the arts are vital for arts’ sake, the skills students acquire in the arts feed into those all-important science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects. Stem subjects require research, attention to detail and a critical approach which is useful in any profession or subject. This means Stem and the arts and humanities complement each other well. Many Stem careers need creativity as much as analytical skills, and most Stem roles are about coming up with solutions to problems – and problem-solving is often about thinking creatively or “outside the box”. Research from Harvard University on the global jobs market has shown that while Stem-related careers grew strongly between 1989 and 2000, they have stalled since. In contrast, the UK’s creative industries are developing new jobs faster than other sectors. According to government figures, the creative industries made a record contribution to the economy in 2017, smashing through the £100bn mark. Their value has grown at nearly twice the rate of the economy since 2010. Film, TV, advertising and digital creative industries including gaming are all part of this thriving sector. To help keep the UK’s creative industries we need more university-level training that combines creativity with business skills. People who know how to secure funding, negotiate international deals and screening rights, grow online traffic, identify new revenue streams, monetise content and more, are very much in demand. To ensure universities are teaching the right skills, we need stronger links between regional universities and local creative businesses. One exemplary programme is the government-funded £80m creative industries clusters.  Business talent and entrepreneurship is vital if this burgeoning industry is to continue to grow – we have Netflix securing more and more studio and office space in the UK, while Apple TV+ and the BBC and ITV’s joint venture Britbox have just launched. Greta understands the relationship between creativity and the sciences. We need to catch up with her.

"Caroline Lucas’s call to increase the area given national park status (Protecting nature is vital to tackle the climate crisis, Journal, 5 December) is very welcome. But it is important that the new areas selected do not replicate the upland bias of our present parks, which reflects the enthusiasm of upland devotees in the quangos of the 1950s and 60s. New parks in places such as Dorset, Gloucestershire, Kent and Herefordshire could act as testbeds for much-needed ways of combining farming and forestry systems to enhance conservation, wildlife, landscape and recreation. For instance, grants to landowners to plant trees could be combined with a requirement to provide public access over the woodlands of the future.Marion ShoardAuthor of This Land is Our Land, Strood, Kent • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com  • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters • Do you have a photo you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

Share this...FacebookTwitterGermany’s centre-left online weekly Die Zeit here presents an interview with a DWD German meteorologist concerning the late December warmth that hit the North Pole, an event that saw global warming activists and alarmists hollering it was evidence of manmade climate change.
Surprisingly the usually very alarmist Die Zeit gave a relatively balanced account from DWD meteorologist Andreas Friedrich in the interview. Alarm called off!
In late December North Atlantic storm “Frank” (In Germany dubbed “Eckard”) pumped a mass of warm air all the way up to the North Pole, sending the mercury there to the melting point for a day or so.
When Friedrich was asked if the event was unusual, he replied that the often ballyhooed temperature jump of 50°C was an exaggeration, and that the real temperature jump was closer to 30°C. The German meteorologist than stated that Atlantic storm Frank was extreme, but nothing that hasn’t been seen before already, explaining that its cause was a cold air mass clashing with a warm air mass near the surfsce.
When Die Zeit asked Friedrich whether the storm was connected to climate change, he replied (my emphasis):

The extreme low has nothing directly to do with climate change, which happens very slowly over very long time periods. Storm Frank happened coincidentally – an atmospheric fit. Such storms happen of course when air masses of very different temperatures clash. According to today’s climate models they will not become more frequent if the earth warms up on average. At most they may be more violent.”

Die Zeit persisted asking: “So extreme lows such as Frank that warm up the North Pole won’t be more frequent?”
Friedrich responded: “That would be pure speculation.”
So there we have it – directly from an expert meteorologist at the alarmist DWD itself, and reported by the alarmist Die Zeit. Of course temperature spikes at the North Pole are nothing new. They’ve happened many times before.

"The climate activist Greta Thunberg has arrived in Lisbon after a three-week catamaran voyage across the Atlantic Ocean from the US. The Swedish teenager now plans to head to Spain to attend the UN climate conference in Madrid. Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts Thunberg hitched a ride from the US with an Australian family on their 48-ft (15-metre) yacht. The white catamaran carrying Thunberg sailed slowly up the River Tagus under blue skies and a stiff breeze. Thunberg’s father, Svante, was also on the boat as it approached the Lisbon quayside. Chile’s environment minister, Carolina Schmidt, saluted Thunberg’s role in speaking out about the threat of climate breakdown. “She has been a leader that has been able to move and open hearts for many young people and many people all over the world,” Schmidt said at the summit in Madrid. “We need that tremendous force in order to increase climate action,.” Thunberg was due to be met in Lisbon by local dignitaries and other activists. Her representatives said they could not confirm when she would travel to the Spanish capital. China produces the most heat-trapping pollution, followed by the US. But historically, the US has contributed more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other nation. The US also has high emissions per capita, compared to other developed countries. And Americans buy products made in China, therefore supporting China's carbon footprint.  She wanted a low-carbon form of transport to get to the climate meeting, which was switched at short notice to Spain from Chile due to unrest there. The yacht, named La Vagabonde, leaves little or no carbon footprint when its sails are up, using solar panels and hydro-generators for electricity. Meanwhile, a report by the UN weather agency released on the sidelines of the climate talks has found that this decade is likely to set a 10-year temperature record. Preliminary measurements show the years 201519 and 2010-19 “are, respectively, almost certain to be the warmest five-year period and decade on record”, the World Meteorological Organization said. “Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than the last.” We believe that the escalating climate crisis is the defining issue of our lifetimes and that the planet is in the grip of an emergency. We know that our readers and supporters around the world care passionately about this too, as so many of you have told us. We want the Guardian to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe. So at the Guardian we commit to the following: Read our full environmental pledge  While full-year figures would not be released until March, 2019 was also expected to be the second or third warmest year since measurements began, with 2016 still holding the all-time temperature record, it said.

Share this...FacebookTwitterA stunning story has developed and it is thoroughly embarrassing Germany’s (naïve) policy of welcoming everyone and anyone, from anywhere, and with little border control to speak of.
As the world has come to learn of the mass gang-sexual-attacks by mobs of men in Cologne during the New Year’s Eve celebrations, what we have in fact witnessed is the Chernobyl of sexual assault on women. No one imagined this possible in a civilized country.
See here for background.
All across Germany
The Huffington Post Germany reports here the mass sexual terrorism against women was much more widespread than just an isolated incident in Cologne, rather it extended to places like Hamburg, Stuttgart, Bielefeld, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt and Berlin.
14 and 15-year old raped
Now, according to the latest media report, two young teenage girls, aged 14 and 15, were also raped by a gang of four men in the Rhine town of Weil – so reports German public broadcaster SWR. The two teenagers allegedly were the victims of “young men from Syria aged 16 – 20“.
Media kept lid on story for days
Amazingly it took the German mainstream media 3 to 4 days to even begin reporting the mass crime, sparking sharp public anger and accusations of a cover-up.
Major print and public broadcasting outlets resisted reporting the Cologne sex assault catastrophe – that is until mass outrage exploded on social media and at a few independent outlets. It was not until January 4 did the mainstream media finally abandon their blackout. Earlier, over months, the German public had been put under psychological pressure by the media and political leaders with thinly veiled threats of being labeled racist or extremist should anyone express criticism of the uncontrolled refugee policy.
Spiegel bullies a critic
For example the massive pressure not to express criticism was yet again plainly demonstrated just yesterday as Spiegel journalist Christina Hebel, who in a commentary here, compared conservative Andreas Scheuer of the Christian Socialist Union (CSU) to right wing extremists – just because he dared criticize the media’s hesitation to report the story and their resulting squandering of the public trust.
Police first claimed Cologne NYE had been “peaceful”

At police authorities in Cologne, so far 122 150 victims have filed reports of sexual assault, theft or even rape. As the scandal spreads, a chorus of accusations that the authorities ignored warnings and simply stood helpless is growing louder.
Bizarrely on the morning of January 1, after the mayhem had simmered down, Cologne police put out the unbelievable press statement claiming that the city’s New Year’s Eve celebrations had been “peaceful” when in fact it more resembled D-Day.

(Note: NTZ does not share the views of the person(s) who uploaded the video at Youtube)
It seemed no one was in a hurry or dared to tell it like it was.
To make things worse, Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker later put some of the blame for the mass sexual assault on the victim themselves, telling at a press conference women should avoid standing too close to strangers, or traveling alone in order to avoid being assaulted. She said:
There’s always the possibility of keeping a certain distance of more than an arm’s length — that is to say to make sure yourself you don’t look to be too close to people who are not known to you, and to whom you don’t have a trusting relationship.”
With that it seems the mayor is telling German women they are now expected to do their part and change their behavior so as to accommodate men who cannot control their urges. Her poorly thought out comments were roundly and harshly criticized.
Europewide, “rape capital” Stockholm, Sweden
The public outrage has become so intense that even left-leaning feminists, such as Alice Schwarzer, are blasting the German immigration policy. The far left retaliated, accusing Ms. Schwarzer of being a “right wing feminist”. Other feminists and activists had long warned trouble was brewing. The mass sexual assault – arguably the terrorism of women – is not an isolated incident taking place in Germany, but has swept across Europe, writes conservative news outlet Breitbart here. Stockholm Sweden today is being called the “rape-capital of the world” because the problem has gotten so bad.
The question remains, and is becoming increasingly urgent: Will Europe’s leaders finally take their responsibility and the fears of citizens seriously, and take real action, or will they let the extreme right exploit it to the max? Failure here is not an option.
Europe has reached a very critical historical crossroad.

"“Fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland.” With those words energy minister Paul Wheelhouse confirmed rumours that have been circulating for months, bringing jubilation to the hearts of experts, campaigners and protestors who responded to the Scottish government’s consultation on exploiting unconventional oil and gas, commonly known as “fracking”. The decision still has to be put to the vote at Holyrood later this year, but with the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Scottish Greens, Labour and LibDems all firmly backing the ban, it’s a formality. This is it: the evidence won. To describe the decision as momentous is not hyperbole; this is a huge victory not just for the Scottish government, but also for Scottish democracy. With support from the Greens, the SNP government has prided itself on consulting extensively on policy matters, and this year has been a particularly busy one for energy policy. Read more: There may be a huge flaw in UK fracking hopes – the geology  This hasn’t always been successful – the consultation on regulating district heating was a complete mess, to the point that a second one is now being prepared, and the new climate change bill has been criticised for lacking in detail and credibility. But let’s put those gripes aside for now. The benefits of fracking would have essentially been none. Any benefits would be short term, purely economic and largely restricted to the industry itself. The risks to the Scottish environment, economy and society are wide-ranging and substantial. The greatest of these is the risk of groundwater contamination, which could severely impact on communities, tourism, agriculture and the whisky industry, not to mention Scotland’s reputation as a world leader in the fight against climate change. Fracking has no co-benefits to the environment and society, and any economic benefits would have been minimal because the reserves are located in geologically complex areas, with recent research indicating that the likelihood that around just 2% of potential reserves would be economically feasible to extract. Compounding this, land ownership in Scotland is fundamentally different to that of the US, which has experienced significant benefits from shale gas. Scotland has less free land in which to exploit the resource, and, as part of the EU, has significantly stronger environmental regulation in place than the US. Of course not everyone is happy about this, most notably Ineos, which operates the Grangemouth chemical plant. But some claim its tactics when it comes to dissent and protest have been heavy handed. Cuadrilla, another major developer of fracking was widely rumoured to be determined to win the “Battle of Balcombe” because if they could beat the middle classes in Sussex they’d have an easier time beating the working classes of Lancashire, scene of the UK’s biggest fracking site. Fracking, and the targeting of those opposed to it, is simply a way of extending the reach and profits of the fossil fuel industry – this is how desperate it has become, knowing that if we are to meet our climate change targets, it needs to shrink to a tiny fraction of its current size in around a decade, and ultimately disappear completely. For Scotland – and indeed the world – that means the next 10 years must see a managed decline of the fossil fuel industry, not an expansion into fracking, with skilled labour transferred to the country’s booming renewable energy industry. This will also put Holyrood on a direct collision course with Westminster; if the Scottish parliament is to realise its ambitions, it will have to secure full devolvement of all responsibilities for energy, particularly the Electricity Act. This will, of course, have significant implications for a second referendum on independence as there are now clear lines between both Holyrood’s political direction, and more importantly, its use of evidence-based policymaking. October 3’s announcement was nothing short of a landmark victory for Scotland. The ban on fracking will help the country fulfil its ambitious plans to curb emissions and combat climate change as we move towards 2020, a critical milestone for the planet."

The high carb, low-fat science is crumbling with ever accelerating speed and in spectacular fashion. And because climate science was established in the very same way, it too will crumble just as spectacularly.
Ancel Keys = Michael Mann
7-Country Chart = Hockey Stick Chart
Fat = CO2
John Yudkin = Richard Lindzen
US Dietary Guidelines = IPCC
Nina Teicholz = Vincent Gray
Also high carb science is chock full with smears, appeals to consensus, arrogance, vicious attacks, data cherry-picking, politicization, peer-review corruption, fraud, obstinance, naïve simplicity, one-sided funding etc. which we’ve all have come to know so well in climate science.
Outstanding essay on how junk science survived 50 years
Just substitute the above in Ian Leslie’s outstanding “The Sugar Conspiracy” and you will see exactly what will happen to CO2 climate science. It’s going to take another one, maybe two decades. It’s a long read, but worth every word and minute.
And as you will see CO2 climate science is an exact carbon copy of the dietary fat scandal and will certainly suffer the same fate.
Some excerpts:

The 2015 edition of the US Dietary Guidelines (they are revised every five years) makes no reference to any of this new research, because the scientists who advised the committee – the most eminent and well-connected nutritionists in the country – neglected to include a discussion of it in their report. It is a gaping omission, inexplicable in scientific terms, but entirely explicable in terms of the politics of nutrition science. If you are seeking to protect your authority, why draw attention to evidence that seems to contradict the assertions on which that authority is founded? Allow a thread like that to be pulled, and a great unravelling might begin.”
On how science progresses:
In a 2015 paper titled Does Science Advance One Funeral at a Time?, a team of scholars at the National Bureau of Economic Research sought an empirical basis for a remark made by the physicist Max Planck: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.”
The researchers identified more than 12,000 “elite” scientists from different fields. […] Searching obituaries, the team found 452 who had died before retirement. They then looked to see what happened to the fields from which these celebrated scientists had unexpectedly departed, by analysing publishing patterns.
What they found confirmed the truth of Planck’s maxim. Junior researchers who had worked closely with the elite scientists, authoring papers with them, published less. At the same time, there was a marked increase in papers by newcomers to the field, who were less likely to cite the work of the deceased eminence. The articles by these newcomers were substantive and influential, attracting a high number of citations. They moved the whole field along.”
On the Internet as an information source:
One of the scientists who called for the retraction of Nina Teicholz’s BMJ article, who requested that our conversation be off the record, complained that the rise of social media has created a “problem of authority” for nutrition science. “Any voice, however mad, can gain ground,” he told me. […]
But in areas where experts have a track record of getting it wrong, it is hard to see how it could be worse. If ever there was a case that an information democracy, even a very messy one, is preferable to an information oligarchy, then the history of nutrition advice is it.”
And rest assured, climate science will show the same.

"You might think that the 100% increases in charges drivers pay for dropping people off at airports over the last year shows that airports are finding new ways to squeeze money from passengers. In fact these reports hide a different story, about the impacts of air travel. Airport operators earn their revenue primarily from take off and landing fees charged to the aircraft that use their facilities. Other services such as car parking and duty-free shopping were only offered more recently, as a benefit for passengers. This changed with the rise of the low-cost carrier – airlines that grew by offering passengers low ticket costs, and so had the clout to negotiate reductions in the fees airports charged them, lest they take their business to another airport. Seeing how the industry was changing, airports obliged and instead sought income from new sources – hence why revenue from retail and car parking are now essential to many modern airports.  However, this is not to say that drop-off fees are being increased purely for profit. It’s widely acknowledged that air travel causes a number of environmental problems, including noise and pollution around airports, and the high carbon emissions of jet fuel and from the power demands of the airport itself. One factor that greatly influences these issues is how passengers get to and from the airport.  Surface access to most airports is dominated by cars – representing over 80% of passenger travel at Manchester Airport for example – whether being dropped off by friends or family or taking a taxi. At large airports, this traffic when combined can measure in the thousands of millions of miles per year, which is a significant environmental impact. Access to Gatwick airport, including by rail and public transport, constitutes over 26% of total airport carbon emissions (an estimated 204,153 tonnes of CO2) – the airport’s second largest source after aircraft emissions. Likewise, local air pollution around some airports exceeds legal limits, partly due to the concentration of vehicles delivering passengers to the airport, as can be seen from Greater London Authority and Transport for London emission data mapped here: Of course, airport operators are aware of this, and many have pledged to reduce the number of passengers arriving by road and have committed to shift passengers on to public transport. Indeed, there is a trend across Europe showing that public transport use to and from airports is on the increase. In the UK, the government has stressed the need for airports to increase public transport access. Increasing drop-off fees is one way to do this, however improving the speed of this trend will require further action from airport operators, local transport authorities, but most of all from those that use airports. The car is popular because it is the most convenient way to travel, providing the most autonomy, comfort and flexibility. The opportunity to say farewell to friends and family at the airport is enough of a reason that people will inconvenience themselves to drive to an airport to drop them off, or indeed to pick them up. It is us, the public, who are the root cause of the environmental impact of our choice of how we get to the airport. We need to acknowledge this more frequently and ask ourselves whether the choices behind our modern lifestyles can be met by a planet of finite natural resources and limited environmental carrying capacity.  But airport operators can do more, and must. Many make clear commitments to increasing public transport use by passengers, but car parking revenues remain a key source of their income – up to 18% at one airport. Examples of these conflicting interests are prevalent across the aviation industry: airports commit to reducing the impact of noise, but aspire towards continual growth and round-the-clock operations that will inevitably generate greater disturbance for those who live under flight paths. Governments have committed to limiting climate change, yet acknowledge that the aviation industry is an essential driver of economic growth.  If our addiction to flying is to continue, as it looks set to, then there are hard questions that demand answers. Thinking twice about how we get to the airport and trying to kick our addiction to the car might be one way for us as individual consumers to contribute toward making flying more sustainable. And in a roundabout way, we’d avoid high car parking charges by doing so."
"The climate emergency is a “challenge of civilisation” requiring sweeping changes to economic systems, but political leaders have not done enough, the pope has said in a message to governments meeting at the annual climate summit in Madrid. “We must seriously ask ourselves if there is the political will to allocate with honesty, responsibility and courage, more human, financial and technological resources [to the climate crisis],” he said, in the pontifical message, which was welcomed by activists.  “Numerous studies tell us it is still possible to limit global warming. To do this we need a clear, far-sighted and strong political will, set on pursuing a new course that aims at refocusing financial and economic investments toward those areas that truly safeguard the conditions of a life worthy of humanity on a healthy planet for today and tomorrow.” He put particular emphasis on the role of young people, who “show a heightened sensitivity to the complex problems that arise from this emergency. We must not place the burden on the next generations to take on the problems caused by the previous ones.” As a small state, the Vatican has observer status at the talks, so the pope is able to send a representative but has no voting rights on key decisions. As an Argentinian, Pope Francis’s words carried particular resonance as this is still regarded as a Latin American COP, despite the last-minute change of venue from Chile to Madrid following political unrest in Santiago. The Chilean government is still the official host, and its environment minister, Carolina Schmidt, is the official Chilean president, in charge of the conference, appearing frequently flanked by Lorena Aguilar of the co-hosts Costa Rica, and the UN’s top climate official, Patricia Espinosa, of Mexico. Kat Kramer, the global climate lead at Christian Aid, welcomed the message from the Holy See: “The pope’s intervention in 2015, Laudato si’, helped to secure the Paris agreement, and pushed the cause of global cooperation. It’s a sad reflection on the lack of progress since then that he feels the need to once again make the moral case for action. “The studies published this week showing temperatures and emissions hitting new highs suggests our leaders are failing us. It’s no wonder that Pope Francis has felt the need to step in once again to remind politicians they need to do a much better job.” Neil Thorns, the director of advocacy at the Catholic aid agency Cafod, said: “Pope Francis is clear you can’t tackle the climate crisis on its own: it has to be considered alongside wider issues of environmental degradation, poverty and inequality.  “His message to COP25 highlights the need to reform our model of development alongside refocusing our economic systems, emphasising the ‘challenge of civilisation’ is for us to act for the common good and with the most vulnerable people at the heart of decisions.” Various faith groups prayed for action on the climate on Tuesday at the COP, and on Friday morning will bring a giant clock to the venue to “sound the alarm” on the climate crisis.  Thursday was designated as youth day, with a series of events held to highlight generational differences. Climate strike activists were planning a march through the centre of Madrid on Friday evening, coordinated with marches in other cities around the world. Progress has been slow on the official agenda at the two weeks of UN talks, which began on Monday. Efforts are focusing on a provision of the Paris agreement that would allow for an international trade in carbon, which is controversial among some activists but supported by others. Behind the scenes, countries are wrangling over how to update their plans to cut or curb greenhouse gas emissions, set out under the 2015 Paris agreement. A growing number of countries, including the UK, which will host next year’s meeting, are signing up to a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but governments are under pressure to set stronger targets for 2030."

by Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The central star of our solar system was quite inactive last month. The measured solar sunspot number (SSN) was 57.7.  That is only 79% of what is the average for this time point into a solar cycle compared to the mean of the 23 previous complete cycles. What follows is a comparison:

Figure 1: The current solar cycle 24 (red) in relation to the mean of all the other previous 23 solar cycles (blue), and to the very similar solar cycle no. 5, which ended in 1810.
For the complete years of the current cycle, a plot of the activity percentage with respect to the mean appears as follows:

Figure 2: Relative sunspot activity of each calendar year for solar cycle no. 24.
For the entire solar cycle so far (now 7 years and 1 month) the sun’s activity has reached only 56% of the mean solar cycle. The deviation from the mean for the accumulated sunspots of the individual cycles 7 years and one month into the cycle are plotted as follows:

Figure 3: The accumulated solar sunspot anomalies from the mean cycle (blue in Figure 1) for each cycle, 7 years and one month into the cycle.
It is clear to see that the phase between solar cycle no. 17 (started in 1933) and the end of solar cycle no. 23 in 2008 was the most active since systematic observations began. That phase was abruptly ended by the current cycle.

"If 1.3 million under-34s voting in 2017 was a “youthquake”, what would you call the 2.6 million registering this time around? The surge in youth and student voter registrations is no accident. Students and their unions have been working tirelessly for months: we started registering students during freshers’ week because we were determined to be ready when a general election was called.  All that organising wouldn’t be effective without the fuel for social change: anger, disillusionment, injustice, and hope. The energy is there – all we have to do is channel it. The headlines are dominated by issues that are pushing us to breaking point: an underfunded NHS, underfunded education, social inequality, a mental health crisis, and the climate emergency destroying our planet.  In this time of crisis we can look to students and young people for answers. Looking back over the past century we see a pattern repeating itself: students and young people have been ahead of the curve on pretty much every major social and political challenge over the past century. Students lobbied for universal healthcare in the 1920s, decades before the creation of the NHS; the climate breakdown was widely mocked when we pushed our first environmental awareness ideas in the 1970s and 80s. Students find an issue, then nurture it. Decades later, that generation grows into its power and marginal issues become mainstream. This is the election of our lives. With our economy, our public services, and our planet in the balance, its importance cannot be understated. So what’s the issue that we have been campaigning on more than any other? Climate catastrophe. We want our futures protected, not sold off for short-term financial gain. That’s why Boris Johnson’s refusal to attend a climate debate is shameful. Incidents of national crisis are already happening: fracking recently caused multiple earthquakes near Blackpool, while Yorkshire has suffered heavy floods. We want an approach to climate breakdown that doesn’t just protect people in the UK, but all over the world. Young people everywhere are rallying behind the Green New Deal. We too want to see a compassionate response to the growing number of climate refugees. More broadly, we want to address the UK’s complicated and cruel immigration system. As well as being a societal issue, this affects us directly. There have been unprecedented regulations placed on universities and colleges requiring them to operate as agents of the Home Office and monitor students’ whereabouts, locations and beliefs. Call me biased, but all roads lead back to education. Education fuels our society and this election is a fight for its life and soul. The university marketisation project has failed. In the past week, staff at 60 universities have been on strike following industrial action at further education colleges. The shortfalls in funding, threats to pensions and increased use of casualisation and “outsourcing” have utterly decayed the foundations of our educational institutions. At the National Union of Students (NUS) we have been campaigning for the creation of a national education service, which would fully fund education to make it accessible to everyone in our society. Today is democracy day. We should not only be celebrating how many young people have registered to vote but looking at how we can make democracy more accessible. The next government must lower the voting age to 16, scrap all plans to introduce voter ID, and put in place systems for automatic voter registration if we are to have any faith that our democracy is working for us. At this stage, all we’ve seen are brazen attempts to suppress our voices in this election period. From plans to roll out voter ID, to proroguing parliament, to manipulating the date of the election, it is clear that the Tories want to disenfranchise us. The decrepit, decaying establishment is shaking with fear at the impact we can have in this election. That is why the NUS has been running our largest ever voter registration campaign. It’s working: record numbers have registered. So make no mistake – on 12 December our voices will be heard. If they call students snowflakes, they should expect an avalanche.

By Frank Bosse und Fritz Vahrenholt
Translated/edited by P Gosselin
In February 2016 the sun was well below normal in activity, just as was the case for the previous several months. The observed sunspot number (SSN) was 57.2. The mean of previous cycles 1 to 23 for this month into the cycle is 80.8. This means last month of cycle no. 24 was only 71% of what is normal.

Figure 1: Solar cycle 24 activity so far (red) compared to the mean of cycles 1 to 23 (blue) and the similar solar cycle number 5 (black). 
A comparison of all 24 cycles follows:

Figure 2: Accumulated sunspot anomaly for each cycle, 87 months after starting. Each bar shows the accumulated monthly deviation from the mean. The current cycle is the weakest in almost two centuries, since solar cycle number 7.
In total solar activity for cycle number 24 has been a mere 57% of the mean with respect to the number of sunspots. It is very probable that the cycle will be among the 3 weakest since observations began in 1749 and end up in the same category as those occurring during the Dalton Minimum (c1790-1830, SC 5 to 7).
What can we anticipate after solar cycle number 24?

In our last solar report here noted that the first indication for the coming cycle is the strength of the sun’s magnetic polar field during the cycle activity minimum before the start of the cycle. There is still some time to go before we reach this activity minimum, yet we would like to take a glance at the polar fields. The data can be obtained here, and we computed them until the end of February 2016. Here we use the smoothed data (marked with “f”  for low-pass filter) because the unfiltered data are characterized by having too much short-term variation.

Figure 3: The smoothed data series of the sun’s polar magnetic fields: the mean value (black), the northern hemisphere (Nf, blue) and the inverted southern hemisphere (-Sf, red).
The polar fields oscillate phase-shifted with sunspot cycles: During the maximum the polar fields have a pole reversal (zero-pass) and vice versa. After the SSN maximum of 2013 especially the fields of the NH are growing significantly slower than the pole reversals measured since the mid 1970s. The SH (red in Fig. 3) is behaving completely normally and is pushing the mean (black in Fig. 3) upwards.
Next we look at the differences between the hemispheres:

Figure 4: The hemispheric differences of the sun’s polar fields. Positive values show stronger NH fields while negative values show stronger SH fields.
We recognize that different fields strengths are not unusual. Except for the polar reversal of SC24, which occurred in 2013, we note that over the entire cycle since 2008 fields in the SH were stronger than the NH and currently we have the largest difference between the fields since 1976.
A number of papers have looked into this phenomenon, e.g. Munoz-Jaramillo et al. (2013) and Ashish Goe et al. ( 2007). They connect asymmetry of the polar fields with a hemispheric decoupling of the solar dynamo. The latter paper also discusses the topic that a strong solar dynamo asymmetry was one of the reasons behind the Maunder Minimum (a phase of very low solar activity from 1645 to 1715).
It is at least worth looking into the varying differences of the sun’s polar field strengths. We will see what happens over the next 1 to 2 years as by then the fields will have reached the maximum and thus possibly make a forecast for the following solar cycle 25 quite robust.

It’s the Prague Media Point journalism event, neatly subtitled “What’s Working?” I’m told that media in the Czech Republic is largely controlled by creepy billionaires, is awash with fake news and is struggling to make ends meet. Sound familiar?  Still, it’s always inspiring to hear that the Upside is not alone: indeed there is a vibrant ecosystem of local journalists around the world seeking out what works in their community and trying to spread the word. My own particular favourites from this week: Tea after Twelve, a Bonn-based operation which publishes in English; Outlier Media, a community self-help grapevine from Detroit; Rubryka, a promising Kiev-based startup (which is only worth clicking through to if you read Ukrainian). And perhaps boldest of all, Takie Dela, a Russian outlet that connects journalists to social problems and charities trying to fix them, in a media environment that can only be described as hostile. Prague has not deflected us from some meaty journalism this week: it’s been a big year for exploring alternative economics, outdated metrics like GDP, growth and the primacy of profits. So this week we took a look at the 20-year drive for ever lower prices and the lazy assumption that all consumers want is cheap stuff.

Here’s a link (in English). The Gas experience may be worth exploring in a future Upside article. Obviously, Italy’s different from the UK in that many people living in towns and cities still have links to villages where their ancestors came from, thereby facilitating the search for locally-sourced, organic produce. Local GAS groups that source products from areas where there have been earthquakes or other natural disasters often offer a solidarity lifeline by offering stricken producers higher prices so that they can get back on their feet again.

"This week the TCI hedge fund announced that it would dump investments in companies that refused to disclose their carbon emissions and did not provide a plan for their reduction. And it accused fund manager BlackRock of “greenwash” for not requiring the same. Well, everybody loves green things and washing, so why is a combination of them bad? As a noun, “greenwash” has since 1987 meant commercial propaganda that propagates an environmentally virtuous public image – such as ads for oil companies featuring cute wildlife. Before that, the verb “greenwashing” was sometimes used as a term for money laundering on behalf of drug cartels, because the US dollars being laundered were “greenbacks”.  Both senses imply the removal of a stain, and “greenwash” was coined on analogy with “whitewash”, the figurative use of which – to mean the erasure of flaws – is first attributed to the Tory leader Viscount Bolingbroke in 1730. Observers who recall David Cameron’s promise to run the “greenest government ever”, as well as Boris Johnson’s current claim that getting to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 will be a top priority if he wins the election, might suppose that Bolingbroke’s modern heirs are also leaders in greenwashing. • Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."
"Beef gets a bad press, environmentally speaking. We’re bombarded with reports highlighting its high carbon footprint accompanied by images of belching cows and devastated rainforests. But is all beef bad? Some argue that beef from grass-fed cows has higher welfare, nutrition and other credentials than meat from animals that eat intensively farmed, high-protein feeds. Most cattle get a mixture of such feeds and grass. Many also argue that purely grass-fed cows not only produce less emissions than those fed soy or grain, but that they can even help absorb carbon from the atmosphere (grass uses up carbon from the air via photosynthesis). My colleagues and I have produced a new report for the Food Climate Research Network that shows the evidence suggests otherwise. Most studies conclude that if you look at the amount of land used and greenhouse gas emissions produced per kilogram of meat, pasture-based cattle actually have a greater climate impact than animals fed grains and soy. This is because commercial feeds tend to be less fibrous than grass, and so cows that eat them produce less methane (through belching and flatulence), which is a potent greenhouse gas. Animals in more intensive, grain-fed systems systems also reach slaughter weight faster than grass-fed animals do, so emissions over the animal’s entire lifetime are lower. However, some academics and many within the alternative farming movement challenge these conclusions. They say that these studies only factor in one side of the greenhouse gas emissions equation: the animals’ emissions. Inspired by ideas such as ecologist and farmer Allan Savory’s principles of “holistic grazing management”, they argue that if you graze cattle in the right way, their nibbling and trampling actions can actually stimulate the grass to put down deep roots and actively remove carbon from the atmosphere. This is plausible under certain circumstances, which is why we considered it in our report. Some even argue that the amount of carbon removed by this type of grazing can actually exceed the cattle’s total emissions. In other words, they should be seen as an essential part of the climate solution. Advocates of grass-fed cows also point out that methane gets broken down in the atmosphere after about 12 years, so it’s only a temporary problem. These and other arguments are even leading to moves to award carbon credits to grazing initiatives. So are these claims justified? We decided to sift through the evidence to find out. We recognised that the grass-fed issue is about multiple social, ethical and environmental concerns but we decided to focus on just one concern: climate change.  We asked one question: what is the net climate impact of grass-fed ruminants, taking into account all greenhouse gas emissions and removals? We found that well-managed grazing in some contexts – the climate, soils and management regime all have to be right – can cause some carbon to be sequestered in soils. But, the maximum global potential (using generous assumptions) would offset only 20%-60% of emissions from grazing cattle, 4%-11% of total livestock emissions, and 0.6%-1.6% of total annual greenhouse gas emissions.  In other words, grazing livestock – even in a best-case scenario – are net contributors to the climate problem, as are all livestock. Good grazing management cannot offset its own emissions, let alone those arising from other systems of animal production. What’s more, soils being farmed using a new system of management, such as grazing, reach carbon equilibrium, where the carbon that flows into soils equal carbon flows out, within a few decades. This means that any benefits from grass-fed cows are time-limited, while the problems of methane and other gases continue for as long as the livestock remain on the land. Plus, a change in management or climate – or even a drought – can overturn any gains. As for methane, the argument that its impact is temporary and so not important is flawed. While the warming effect of any given pulse of methane is temporary, the total warming impacts will continue for as long as the source of methane continues. Methane will be emitted and continue to warm the planet as long as cattle are still reared. The problem only disappears if ruminant production is abandoned. How we use land is also changing, which poses new challenges. Grazing ruminants have historically driven deforestation and the carbon dioxide emissions associated with it. But today, demand for soy and grains to feed pigs, poultry, and intensively reared cattle poses a new threat. This drives the conversion of grassland to grow such grains and the release of carbon stored in it.  That said, ruminants are still implicated. Forests are still cut down while grasslands are being intensified to support more livestock farming. This means using fertilisers or planting legumes, which cause nitrous oxide emissions, on top of the methane the animals produce. In other words, whatever the system and animal type, rising animal production and consumption is driving damaging changes in land use and associated release of greenhouse gases. The priority for now and coming years is to figure out the least bad environmental way of using land and other resources to feed ourselves and meet our other developmental goals. We need to question the common assumption that high levels of consumption in affluent countries, and rapidly rising demand in developing countries, are inevitable. The more that demand for meat increases, the harder it will be to tackle our climatic and other environmental challenges."
"The dominant position that China holds in global manufacturing means that for many years China has also been the largest global importer of many types of recyclable materials. Last year, Chinese manufacturers imported 7.3m metric tonnes of waste plastics from developed countries including the UK, the EU, the US and Japan. However, in July 2017, China announced big changes in the quality control placed on imported materials, notifying the World Trade Organisation that it will ban imports of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste by the end of the year. This campaign against yang laji or “foreign garbage” applies to plastic, textiles and mixed paper and will result in China taking a lot less material as it replaces imported materials with recycled material collected in its own domestic market, from its growing middle-class and Western-influenced consumers. The impact of this will be far-reaching. China is the dominant market for recycled plastic. There are concerns that much of the waste that China currently imports, especially the lower grade materials, will have nowhere else to go.  This applies equally to other countries including the EU27, where 87% of the recycled plastic collected was exported directly, or indirectly (via Hong Kong), to China. Japan and the US also rely on China to buy their recycled plastic. Last year, the US exported 1.42m tons of scrap plastics, worth an estimated US$495m to China.  So what will happen to the plastic these countries collect through household recycling systems once the Chinese refuse to accept it? What are the alternatives?  Plastics collected for recycling could go to energy recovery (incineration). They are, after all, a fossil-fuel based material and burn extremely well – so on a positive note, they could generate electricity and improve energy self-sufficiency.  They could also go to landfill (not ideal) – imagine the press headlines. Alternatively, materials could be stored until new markets are found. This also brings problems, however – there have been hundreds of fires at sites where recyclable materials are stored. While it is a reliable material, taking many forms from cling film (surround wrap) to flexible packaging to rigid materials used in electronic items, the problems caused by plastic, most notably litter and ocean plastics, are receiving increasing attention.  One way forward might be to limit its functions. Many disposable items are made from plastic. Some of them are disposable by necessity for hygiene purposes – for instance, blood bags and other medical items – but many others are disposable for convenience.  Looking at the consumer side of things, there are ways of cutting back on plastic. Limiting the use of plastic bags through financial disincentives is one initiative that has shown results and brought about changes in consumer behaviour. In France, some disposable plastic items are banned and in the Britain, leading pub chain Wetherspoons has banned disposable, one-use plastic drinking straws. Deposit and return schemes for plastic bottles (and drink cans) could also incentivise behaviour. Micro-beads, widely used in cosmetics as exfoliants, are now a target as the damage they do becomes increasingly apparent and the UK government has announced plans to ban their use in some products. This follows similar actions announced by the US and Canada, with several EU nations, South Korea and New Zealand also planning to implement bans.  Many local authorities collect recycling that is jumbled together. But a major side effect of this type of collection is that while it is convenient for the householder, there are high contamination levels which leads to reduced material quality. This will mean it is either sold for lower prices into a limited market, will need to be reprocessed through sorting plants, or will be incinerated or put in landfill. But changes to recycling collections and reprocessing to improve the quality of materials could be expensive.  Alternatively, recycled plastic could be used to provide chemicals to the petrochemical sector, fuels to the transport and aviation sectors, food packaging and many other applications. The problems we are now facing are caused by China’s global dominance in manufacturing and the way many countries have relied on one market to solve their waste and recycling problems. The current situation offers us an opportunity to find new solutions to our waste problem, increase the proportion of recycled plastic in our own manufactured products, improve the quality of recovered materials and to use recycled material in new ways."
"National governments have historically led efforts to address climate change; setting the targets, planning the actions and then succeeding (or often failing) to achieve climate action goals. But increasingly, local, city and regional authorities are stepping up to tackle the challenge. Municipal governments are setting climate targets; corporations, investors and pension funds are funding local initiatives; and communities and individuals are driving the shift to a lower-carbon future.  Local actions have the potential to save as much as £7 billion each year across the 50 largest cities in the UK – that’s equivalent to £300 per year for every person in each of these cities – and create more than 90,000 years of extra employment. A range of measures could deliver striking savings for individual households (£2.3 billion annually), schools, hospitals, offices and other non-residential buildings (£1.2 billion annually) and industry (£510m annually).  With the assistance of Rafael Luviano Ortiz, our team at the University of Leeds have come up with emissions projections and action plans for every local authority, local enterprise partnership, region and country in the UK, to support further action from this diverse coalition of governments, business and citizens. This work has been carried out as part of the Can-Do Cities initiative – a model designed to be used by other cities and communities, to develop their own climate and energy strategies. Our work shows that a wide range of actions can be taken to complement national policy and reduce emissions even further – all while delivering economic returns. Exploiting opportunities for climate action at a regional or local level could help cities to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 23%, over and above the reductions happening through measures that have been planned already.  What’s more, these measures can yield further social, economic and environmental benefits if they are effectively implemented. For instance, in Leeds, Yorkshire, investments in energy efficiency and retrofits in homes could reduce energy bills more than £80m pounds annually, helping the poorest households to afford to keep warm in the winter.  In London, investments in low-carbon industrial processes could save the entire industrial sector more than £161m annually, improving competitiveness and freeing up funds to hire new workers and invest in new technologies.  Meanwhile, in Birmingham, investments in commercial buildings, hospitals, schools and local shops to upgrade heating and cooling systems, appliances and lighting could save £46m annually, helping small business owners expand and public services improve. And in Glasgow, investments in low carbon actions across each of these sectors could generate 2,400 years of employment: the equivalent of 240 full-time jobs for ten years. To make this information readily accessible, the Can-Do Cities team have produced reports and generated league tables of the most cost and carbon-effective actions, revealing opportunities for low carbon investment for every locality, city or region in the UK. Below, you can see the league tables for Leeds.  Of course, concerted efforts must to be made to actually realise these benefits. Significant investments are needed. In a typical local authority, the total cost of low carbon measures across all sectors is about 1% of the Gross Value Added (GVA) each year, for the next ten years. Even though these measures provide financial returns, they would benefit from support from central government.  Actions also need to be coordinated: land-use and transport developments must be planned with neighbouring cities and regions, in order to maximise the benefits.  The need for climate action must be embedded in the decisions made by local governments, businesses and citizens. Homes and offices are rarely designed with climate change as a primary consideration, and the same goes for transport networks and industrial plants. But the types of buildings and roads constructed today will influence the level of emissions coming from communities far into the future.  Climate action needs to be sustained, while adapting to advancements in technology, which promise to provide new ways of reducing emissions, and may significantly lower the cost of existing options. For example, the uptake of electric vehicles could have a dramatic impact on emissions, if prices continue to fall and the grid continues to become less reliant on energy from fossil fuels. And while batteries and small-scale renewables such as solar and wind power are still a relatively costly way to store and produce electricity, advances seem imminent.  These kinds of changes don’t undercut social, economic or environmental development; in fact, they contribute towards it. The analysis from our Can-do Cities team shows that reducing emissions can often lead to more liveable homes, more productive offices, improved urban mobility, and financial savings for industry: just the sort of improvements which all cities are looking to achieve."
"The safety of the public was paramount and therefore once the lynx had strayed over to a populated area of the community it was necessary to act decisively. Statement from Ceredigion County Council on October 10, 2017. An escaped lynx was recently destroyed by experts working on behalf of Ceredigion County Council in Wales after attempts to recapture it failed. Some people have responded angrily, arguing that officials should have tranquilised the animal rather than killing it. The council claimed it had done all it could and was left with no other option. So was there a way Lilith the lynx could have been saved? Zoo animals all receive a danger category for their potential to cause serious harm. Animals such as tigers, lions, elephants, and lynx are classed as Category 1, the most dangerous animals, due to their natural behaviour and predatory way of life. Animals which may cause slight harm or injury are classified as Category 2, and those which are no threat to the public get classed as Category 3. Within the UK, zoos are licenced by local authorities, who conduct inspections on a regular basis to ensure the health and safety of the animals, staff and the public that visit them. Safety from the animal enclosure side of things is always viewed to reduce the likelihood of the public getting in, and the animals getting out. But zoos are home to some incredibly smart animals which are able to notice small gaps in the gates and doorways or when electric fencing may not be working efficiently. More often than not, animals that manage to escape their enclosures have noticed these holes before the keepers.  Zoos practice animal escape drills at least twice a year and in the event of an animal escape from its enclosure, these drills are put into practice and ensure the safety of every visitor and member of staff on site. Every effort is usually made to recapture the animal but of course, it very much depends on the species. An animal such as a penguin for example would likely follow a trail of fish back into its enclosure and would not cause too much disruption. Some animals actually get quite scared when they realise that they are outside of their home and in a world that they do not know and make their own way back without much encouragement at all.  In the recent case of the lynx from Borth Wild Animal Kingdom, the animal not only managed to escape its enclosure, but the perimeter grounds of the zoo, too, which placed a lot more public at risk and with little control over the situation. The local authorities and police were notified and the zoo made every effort to recapture the lynx, reportedly including using traps and following it with a drone equipped with a thermal imaging camera. Animal tranquilisation is always discussed but with any animal, including the lynx, there is no way of telling how the animal may react to this and if it may make the animal more aggressive or react in a way that is not expected. This could cause further harm and situations that are unable to be prepared for. The decision was finally made to humanely destroy the animal, as the potential risk to the public was too great. In this situation, there are not many options, and human life and safety has to be the highest priority. The council and local police made the right call. Human life has to come first. Every effort had been made to recapture the animal, and there was nothing more that could have been done.  Dr Paul Rees, Senior Lecturer in Wildlife, University of Salford The author of this fact check is right. The owners of Borth Wild Animal Kingdom had a legal obligation to prevent the escape of the lynx under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 and the EU Zoos Directive. They failed to do this and then failed to recapture her. The local authority had no choice but to shoot the animal. What’s more, releasing or allowing a non-native species into the wild is an offence under section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This law protects our native biodiversity. Lynx are classified in the Secretary of State’s Standards of Modern Zoo Practice as category 1 (greater risk), that is “likely to cause serious injury or be a serious threat to life”. Although reports of attacks on humans by lynx appear to be rare, a pet lynx was reported to have attacked a woman who was feeding it in Atlanta in 2014."
"The last decade has been one of “exceptional” heat around the world, and was almost certainly the hottest on record, while the oceans have also warmed to record levels and grown markedly more acidic, the World Meteorological Organization has said. Temperatures for the years from 2010 to 2019 were about 1.1C above the average for the pre-industrial period, showing how close the world is coming to the 1.5C of warming that scientists say will cause dramatic impacts, extreme weather and the loss of vital ecosystems. The preliminary findings of the State of the Global Climate, an annual publication by the WMO, show that this year is on course to be the second or third warmest since records began. Over land, the impacts from January to October have included severe droughts, heatwaves and floods across all inhabited continents, and over the seas there have also been heatwaves. During the past year, the upper levels of the oceans, measured since the 1950s, have exceeded previous records so far this year, and the ocean experienced about 1.5 months of unusually warm temperatures, with large areas of the north-east Pacific showing severe heatwaves. The Arctic sea ice minimum in September was the third smallest on record. The final version of the report will be published in March. Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary general, said the impacts of rising concentrations of carbon in the atmosphere were becoming ever more harmful, as demonstrated in this year’s extreme weather events.  “Heatwaves and floods which used to be once-in-a-century events are becoming more regular occurrences. Countries from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique suffered devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia,” he said. He warned that more erratic rainfall patterns posed a threat to crop yields, which, combined with population increases, would mean “considerable food security challenges for vulnerable countries in the future”. The findings came as the world’s governments gathered in Madrid for a critical UN conference on the climate. On Monday, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned that though the technology and economic means to fight climate chaos were available, political will was lacking. He called on world leaders and governments to pay heed to young people, who were “showing remarkable leadership and mobilisation”. The latest WMO figures showed the pattern of warming was growing stronger, warned Keith Shine, regius professor of meteorology and climate science at the University of Reading. “Each of the past four decades has been 0.1 to 0.2C warmer than the decade before. Carbon dioxide levels have continued their relentless rise, and methane levels have grown much more rapidly than in the previous decade. Unless things start to change markedly, it is going to get harder and harder to meet the goals of the Paris agreement.” While average temperatures may seem to be only gradually creeping up over decades, this disguises the true impact on lives, explained Grant Allen, professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Manchester. “This [temperature rise] does not simply mean slightly warmer summers, it means an increased frequency of extreme weather globally – droughts, heatwaves, flooding and changing patterns in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones. “These impacts are real and happening now and place huge pressures on communities and countries – put simply, these impacts make for a more unstable world, and are already having profound impacts on our ecosystems and biodiversity.”"
"Fossil fuels currently dominate the production of electricity and heat. Although renewable energy accounts for around a quarter of electricity produced in the UK, the production of central heating is dominated by natural gas, which supplies around 70% of UK heat demand (the UK has been a net importer of gas since 2004).  There are fewer low carbon alternatives for heat production than there are for electricity. Solar hot water and biomass are the two main touted alternatives. Solar hot water is usually produced at a domestic level and requires access to a south facing roof. Biomass can be used as a heat source but may be constrained by availability and the transportation of fuel. And so it is unclear how future heat demands could be met from low carbon sources. Geothermal heat is one solution that offers a low carbon, secure and continuous energy source. Classic geothermal regions such as Iceland and New Zealand capitalise on their volcanic landscapes by capturing the steam and hot fluids produced as a result of tectonic activity. Geothermal fluids in the UK are over 100°C and hot enough to drive turbines, produce electricity and also supply heat. Also, geothermal fluids may issue naturally at the surface as hot springs and geysers, avoiding the need to drill to access them. Of course, the UK is not characterised by such tectonic activity. But we believe that abandoned deep mines contain good geothermal potential. The deeper you drill into the Earth, the warmer it gets. Geologists call this the Earth’s “geothermal gradient”, driven by heat produced at the Earth’s core that radiates towards the crust. In non-tectonic areas, temperatures increase on average by around 25°C per kilometre. This means we can predict what temperature may be encountered at any specific depth.  But extracting geothermal energy from these warm depths is only possible if water is present and is able to flow from the rock. Heat and water flow are essential for extracting geothermal energy.  Abandoned coal mines, therefore, seem incredibly promising due to their networks of flooded galleries and shafts lying at depths of up to several hundred metres below the surface. One can be almost certain that the water flow necessary for deep geothermal wells will be found in these flooded underground voids. The risk of not finding flowing water underground can inhibit deep geothermal developments elsewhere. Vast volumes (over 15 billion tonnes) of coal have been extracted from deep mines in the UK over the last century. To put this into context, if this extracted coal were spread over the UK land surface, this would result in a five cm deep layer of coal across the country. Today, UK coal production from deep mining has declined to almost zero and the nation recently celebrated its first coal free day of power generation, in April 2017.  Think about this. The volume of coal extracted compares to an equivalent void volume underground. On this basis (once allowing for subsidence), we estimate that the abandoned mines of the UK contain around two billion cubic metres of water at temperatures which are constantly around 12-16°C, and in some instances higher still. If heat corresponding to a 4°C temperature drop was removed from this volume, around 38,500TJ of heat could be liberated. This conservative estimate could provide enough heat for around 650,000 homes nationally. Clearly, you wouldn’t want to take a bath or heat your home with water at these low temperatures, but using a heat pump, the water temperature could be upgraded to more useful temperatures of 40-50°C.  A heat pump takes energy from a source such as water within an abandoned mine and “lifts” it to a more useful temperature. You can think of it working like a fridge: if you put food at room temperature in a fridge, after a while it will be cooled to the temperature of the fridge. The heat removed from the food is lost from the back of the fridge, which is why this area feels warm. The radiators in a home are effectively the same as the back of the fridge. A heat pump uses electricity to boost the temperature but for every kW of electrical power used, the heat pump will produce three to four kW of heat. This is why heat pumps are a low carbon alternative to gas boilers. So we know that the UK has sufficient potential for geothermal heat production in its extensive mines. The next consideration, then, is proximity to the heat demand. Given the low temperatures involved, the heat source needs to be close to the end user to minimise losses. Many UK towns and cities grew due to their coal reserves, meaning that centres of heat demand and areas of abandoned mines often coincide, making them ideal targets. The UK government’s fifth carbon budget sets out plans to decarbonise heat by stating that one in 20 homes should be connected to a heat network by 2030. This is an ambitious challenge but abandoned mines could make a significant contribution here. Minewater district heating schemes have already been successfully developed at several locations. One early example was developed at the Ropak packaging plant in Springhill, Nova Scotia, in 1998. A minewater and heat pump system that uses minewater at 18°C provides heating and cooling for the 13,500-square-metre site leading to huge savings in avoided fuel-oil costs. And at Heerlen in the Netherlands, a larger scheme has been operating since 2008, supplying heat to 500,000 square metres of commercial and residential buildings. Areas planned for new development in former mining areas make ideal targets as they provide an opportunity to incorporate the necessary above ground infrastructure. But if coal mines are to decarbonise heat, we need to deploy these systems in more places. Is this possible? We think so. The fact that many coalfields are overlain by urban centres means that there is certainly good potential for many former mining areas. Although abandoned mines provide a lower temperature resource than deeper geothermal sources, they are systems known to flow copious quantities of relatively warm water and provide a readymade subsurface store of heat.  There is a delightful irony that the legacy of the dirtiest of fuels, coal, now has the potential to deliver a low carbon energy future."
"António Guterres, the United Nations secretary general, contrasted the “leadership” and “mobilisation” shown by the world’s youth on the climate emergency with the lack of action by governments, which were failing to keep up with the urgency of the problem despite increasing signs that the climate was reaching breakdown. Before the start of a critical conference on the climate crisis on Monday, he said the world had the technical and economic means to halt climate chaos, but what was missing was political will. “The technologies that are necessary to make this possible are already available. Signals of hope are multiplying. Public opinion is waking up everywhere. Young people are showing remarkable leadership and mobilisation. [But we need] political will to put a price on carbon, political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels [and start] taxing pollution instead of people.”  Guterres called for further investment from rich countries and support for poor nations to make the changes needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cope with the impacts of global heating. Amid rising temperatures, wildfires, heatwaves, droughts and floods, the danger signals were clear and must be acted on without further delay, he said. “In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments – particularly from the main emitters – to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.” He was joined in his call by the leaders and representatives of some of the world’s poorest countries, which are suffering most from climate change. The countries most at risk of deluge from climate chaos have issued an impassioned plea to the industrialised world ahead of crucial negotiations on the Paris agreement that start on Monday in Madrid. “We see [these talks] as the last opportunity to take decisive action,” Janine Felson, deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) told the Guardian. “Anything short of vastly greater commitment to emission reduction, a new climate finance goal and tangible support for disaster risk reduction will signal a willingness to accept catastrophe.” Pacific atolls and other low-lying islands are likely to be inundated if temperatures rise to more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels, while current Paris commitments put the world on track for a “disastrous” 3C. “We are mired in a planetary emergency of existential proportion,” said the leaders of the 44 states of AOSIS, in a joint statement. “The impacts are real and current for people living on small islands. This does not have to be our destiny or legacy.” While small islands are at greatest risk, rich countries were also suffering, said Clarence Samuel, lead negotiator for the Marshall Islands. “None of us are immune,” he said. “All month we have watched in horror as our Pacific cousins Australia have literally watched their country burn, fuelled by a climate crisis of our own making.” To fulfil the Paris goals, far tougher targets on emissions are needed, while this year’s negotiations – known as COP25, running from 2 December to 13 December – will focus on technical issues such as a mechanism for trading carbon within the Paris agreement. Resolving these technicalities will allow the UN to wrap up the Paris “rulebook”, setting out how to measure and achieve emissions cuts, but experts are concerned that it leaves too little time for the substantive question of targets, which under the rules must be resolved by the end of 2020. Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”.

It’s positive that finance ministers and central bank governors will come this year, and countries like the EU and China need to show leadership.” Under the 2015 Paris agreement, countries are supposed to set out more ambitious climate action in 2020, when current targets expire. Governments were given the five-year grace period to ratchet up their national goals. Some countries – including the UK – have put in place long-term goals of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, that leaves hanging the question of 2030 targets, which are needed to keep countries on track. Talks on the crucial matter of 2030 commitments will largely be relegated to informal meetings on the sidelines of COP25, though these are what will determine the success of the Paris agreement – and the future of the climate. There are also continuing tensions at the talks over funding to help developing economies curb emissions and cope with the consequences of climate disaster, and whether poor countries should be compensated by the rich for the loss and damage caused by global heating. Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: “The world’s small window of opportunity is closing rapidly. We must urgently deploy all the tools of multilateral cooperation to make COP25 the launchpad for more climate ambition to put the world on a transformational path towards low carbon and resilience.” The talks, taking place in Madrid after the original host nation, Chile, pulled out owing to its political crisis, will also be overshadowed by US president Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement. The US last month formally submitted the one year’s notice legally required for withdrawal under the accord. The withdrawal will formally take effect the day after the next US presidential election, and just before the next UN talks in November 2020, to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow. A US State Department spokesperson told the Guardian: “The US delegation at COP25 will actively engage in negotiations to protect US interests and level the playing field for US businesses.” • This article was amended on 2 December 2019 because an earlier version misspelt the surname of António Guterres as Guterrez."

Angela Merkel’s policy of unhindered mass immigration is coming home to roost as her CDU party took a massive body blow in this Sunday’s state elections.
Also Germany’s other mainstream established parties have been dealt severe hits as voters went to the polls in three states: Saxony Anhalt, Baden Württemberg and Rhineland Palatinate.
Rise of the Right
The recently minted populist rightwing Alternativ für Deutschland (AfD) – Alternative for Germany- has risen into a major party that will certainly become a thorn in Germany’s consensus-oriented mainstream political landscape.
The AfD pulled in an astonishing 24% in the eastern state of Saxony Anahlt amid growing fears of an emerging right. They performed strongly elsewhere as voters ignored warnings not to vote for them.
The preliminary results and the change from 2011 are in:

Saxony Anhalt
CDU conservatives 29.7 % (lost 2.8%)
SPD socialists 10.2% (lost 11.3%)
Linke (leftists) 15.7.9% (lost 8.0%)
Grünen (greens) 5.0% (lost 2.1%)
FDP free democrats 3.8% (gained 1.2%)
AfD (rightwing) 24.0%
Baden Württemberg
CDU Conservatives 26.9% (lost 12.1%)
SPD socialists 12.8% (lost 10.3%)
Linke (leftists) 2.9% (gained 0.1%)
Grünen (greens) 30.5% (gained 6.2%)
FDP free democrats 8.4% (gained 3.1%)
AfD (rightwing) 14.9%
Rhineland Palatinate 
CDU Conservatives 32.0% (lost 3.2%)
SPD socialists 36.8% (gained 1.1%)
Linke (leftists) 3.0% (no change)
Grünen (greens) 5.2% (lost 10.3%)
FDP free democrats 6.2% (gained 2.0%)
AfD (rightwing) 11.7%
The numbers will be revised as the evening goes on.
Overall it’s clear that Germany’s mainstream parties took severe hits. In protest to the handling of immigration policy, a large chunk of voters opted for the AfD party. It’s unknown whether the AfD has any staying power. They’ve been under massive attack by the media and established politicians.
The FDP Free Democrats appear to have emerged from their near extinction, managing to squeak by the 5.0% threshold in all three states.
One thing is certain: Germans are demanding alternatives to the consensus-driven culture that has gripped the country since Angela Merkel has been in office as chancellor. Germans don’t mind immigration, and understand it is necessary. They just want it to be done right. Sound familiar?

"Civil society groups have been voicing concerns about the upcoming Euro-American trade deal the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) since it was announced three years ago.  The list of worries includes companies being able to constrain public policy; the potential for weaker consumer and health and safety standards; and the secrecy around the negotiations. Genetically modified (GM) products are one subject on the table, since they fall within TTIP’s broader remit to tackle areas where the US and EU approaches are furthest apart and have therefore been ignored by previous efforts to harmonise regulations. Not surprisingly, perhaps, the potential effect on how GM is regulated is of serious concern.  In the US the share of GM crops, particularly maize and soybeans, has grown steadily over the years – even though support for the technology is not universal. The US has no specific legislation over GM crops, but approves them either through the Food and Drug Administration or via national environmental policy processes, depending on the variety and purpose.  Approvals use a science-based risk assessment, which focuses on whether scientists have identified sufficient risks to justify a ban. Although the federal authorities are the most important in this area, municipal authorities also have jurisdiction over GM to some extent, and some Californian municipalities have banned cultivation, for example. On the other hand, attempts at both federal and state level to force consumer products to carry GM labels have failed. In the EU, applications to approve new crops go to the relevant member state and are then passed to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The EFSA makes a recommendation to the European Commission (EC), which in turn makes a recommendation that is subject to a vote by the member states. These recommendations are based on the precautionary principle – meaning that approvals might be refused if the science is not sufficiently certain about the level of risk involved.  As things stand, only one GM crop has EU approval for cultivation. Imports of consumer products and animal feeds with GM ingredients are permitted, but they must be labelled if the GM content is above 0.9%; and non-GM foods and feeds can display labels signalling that they are GM free.  The reason why so few GM products are permitted is that strong opposition in some member states, including Austria, France, Germany, Hungary, Poland and Italy, led the EC to suspend its approval processes in 1998. To get around this, new regulations introduced last April include opt-out measures so that even if a product is approved at EU level, individual member states can still decide not to allow cultivation or use the product in food or animal feeds in their national territory. This is designed to break the deadlock and allow more pro-GM areas like Spain, Portugal and the English part of the UK to take up these products. These changes to the rules are linked to a World Trade Organisation (WTO) 2006 ruling against the EU’s approach to granting GM approvals, following pressure from US farming groups and GM manufacturers. The WTO found that most EU member states were unduly slow to deal with approval applications for new GM crops and that a previous pan-EU moratorium on new applications contravened the rules of international trade.  When it comes to predicting what TTIP could mean for the very different approaches to GM in the US and EU, people often look to the other ambitious US trade deal in the making, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which involves 11 other Pacific Rim countries. From the parts of TPP published so far, environmental groups like Ecowatch are concerned that the section on sanitary and phytosanitary standards could weaken national resolve to control GM through labelling.  Though it doesn’t mention prevention of GM labelling as such, it includes commitments to prevent undue delays on imports of agricultural goods; to limit inspections; and accept that different systems can achieve the same outcome. Meanwhile, the sections on intellectual property include a 10-year data-exclusivity requirement for new agricultural chemical products. This appears to provide an additional economic incentive for GM producers to develop products and push for greater market share.  TPP also pushes for each country to recognise the other signatories’ certification systems for organic products, which raises an analogy with the US-South Korea free-trade agreement of 2011. Following the agreement Korea was forced to adapt its zero tolerance against GM, which had previously meant that to be considered organic in that South Korea, products had to have a 100% guarantee that there was no GM contamination in them. Since certain non-GM organic products from the US could not give that 100% guarantee, they had not previously qualified as organic in Korea. The trade deal meant that if products were labelled organic in the US, they had to be accepted as organic in South Korea.  Because most EU members still oppose GM, it seems highly improbable that the US will be able use the TTIP negotiations to force Europe to dramatically change its position. But GM labelling, which is voluntary in the US, might be the area where the Americans try to exert the most pressure.  TTIP is no doubt generating heated debates behind closed doors. Because the final outcome will depend on trade-offs and linkages across the whole agreement, it is impossible to say how this will affect GM at this stage. And even once we have a published agreement, it will take years before we see how it is implemented and interpreted in practice – just like it will with TPP. All we can say is that it has the potential to have a substantial effect on current regulation. Many people are therefore watching developments closely.

Share this...FacebookTwitterGlobal warming alarmists like to tell us that we can all trust the global warming science – because “97% of all scientists – an overwhelming consensus -” agree with the science. They just couldn’t possibly be wrong, could they?
Unfortunately history shows us that whenever such claims of consensus are used as the main argument to support a science theory, then it is very likely totally wrong. Yes, the earth used to be flat.
Today we see the latest great example of this, made crystal clear by a new study just released by the University of Eastern Finland titled:
High-cholesterol diet, eating eggs do not increase risk of heart attack, not even in persons genetically predisposed, study finds
Recall how for decades we were warned of the serious dangers of saturated fats and cholesterol in our diets. By the 1980s, 99% of all physicians, heart surgeons, the AMA; NAS, AHA, nutritionists -you name it – all full-heartedly agreed. The US government and health institutions worldwide even made it official policy to promote the high carb, lowfat diet as consequence. Today we see the devastating result: a catastrophic global epidemic of obesity and obesity related diseases that is set to bankrupt health care systems internationally.
In the meantime, Big AG and Big Pharma raked in trillions with the blood of tens of milllions dripping from their hands.
Remember how were told to limit out intake of eggs. Well, the University of East Finland has just released the results of a comprehensivbe study on eggs and heart health. They show:
…a relatively high intake of dietary cholesterol, or eating one egg every day, are not associated with an elevated risk of incident coronary heart disease. Furthermore, no association was found among those with the APOE4 phenotype, which affects cholesterol metabolism and is common among the Finnish population.”

The findings were published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
Again recall that this all totally flies in the face of almost 50 years of science once deemed as indisputable, as is junk climate science today.
Science Daily writes the dietary habits of 1032 men aged between 42 and 60 years were assessed and the study found that the consumption of eggs, which are rich in dietary cholesterol, was not associated with the risk of incident coronary heart disease.
The study did not establish a link between dietary cholesterol or eating eggs with thickening of the common carotid artery walls, either.”
They found nothing, absolutely NADA! No risk!
The fact is that the story of cholesterol is one of scientific fraud (see starting at 19:00) conducted by the shady manufacturers of plant-based “food” oils and Big Agriculture.
The real heart killer is turning out to be plant-based oils (e.g. canola, cottonseed, corn oil, etc.) peddled by Big Ag, and the highly processed carbohydrates from US food industry, in part with the blessing of a greedy pharmaceutical industry. 

Slowly we are finding out that the 50-year long high-carb low-fat scam is turning out to be the crime of the 20th century.

"It is often assumed that tornadoes do not occur in Europe and that they are a weather phenomena specific to the United States. But this is far from true. Not only do tornadoes strike in Europe – they do millions of pounds worth of damage, cause serious injuries and even lead to fatalities. Despite these facts they are still perceived as a curiosity and as a result their threat is underestimated.    Tornadoes have not always been overlooked in Europe and many natural philosophers and scientists have proposed theories about their formation and impact. Theories were proposed by Greek philosophers such as Aristotle in Meteorologica and Roman philosophers such as Seneca in Naturales Quaestiones. The systematic study of European tornadoes began in the 17th-century. Writing in 1694, the Italian astronomer and mathematician Geminiano Montanari analysed a tornado that occurred in the Veneto region of Italy in July 1686.  In fact, before the end of the World War II, European scientists and meteorologists led the research into tornadoes while in the United States the word “tornado” was banned by the Weather Bureau because the government was afraid of causing panic. But the situation changed in March 1948 when Air Force Captain Robert C. Miller and Major Ernest J. Fawbush issued the first US tornado forecast and, as a result, the United States began to surpass Europe in the study of twisters. After 1950, the interest of European researchers and meteorologists declined, despite the occurrence of high-impact tornadoes. For example, in June 1967 six tornadoes resulted in 232 injuries and 15 fatalities in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. There has also been regular less intense tornadoes doing damage throughout Europe, such as the ones that tore through several streets in north-west London in 2006 and Birmingham in 2005. Despite these incidents, there has still been a general lack of interest resulting in a lack of tornado databases which in turn lead to the threat being downplayed.  Over the last two years, my colleagues and I have tried to change the general public opinion – and even the opinion of some researchers and meteorologists – concerning European tornadoes. The aim is to show that tornadoes do occur in Europe, although their reported frequencies and intensities are lower compared with the United States. Our research focused on developing a pan-European baseline climatology of tornadoes and waterspouts (a tornado over a body of water). We synthesised tornado and waterspout observations across Europe between 1800-2014 to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of these weather phenomena.  The synthesis was based on regional tornado sightings and articles published in peer-review journals for 30 European countries which contained 9,563 tornadoes and waterspout reports. These reports came mainly from western, southern and northern Europe, with just a few reports coming from Eastern Europe where databases were only developed after 1990.  We showed that tornadoes in Europe need to be taken more seriously. Between 1950 and 2015, European tornadoes resulted in 4,462 injuries, 316 fatalities and damages estimated at more than €1 billion. To increase awareness about tornadoes in Europe and to reduce their threat we believe that meteorological services across the continent, including researchers and the general public, need to collaborate more. The threat can only be understood from a pan-European perspective. The tornado impact for individual countries will be perceived as low because European countries have relatively small areas and so the number of tornadoes will be low when compared with the impact in the US. A low impact will not justify the investment in the development of tornado databases and development of warning systems. The contribution from the general public is essential. Unlike temperature records which are measured by thermometers, tornado records require the presence of an observer and the existence of a system for collecting the observations. Such systems to collect tornado reports have only been developed recently. Citizen science projects – such as the European Severe Weather Database were the general public can submit tornado reports which are then verified by meteorologist and researchers – are the most efficient way to develop a pan-European tornado database.  After being virtually ignored for more than 60 years, tornadoes in Europe are again a topic of research and discussion among academics and meteorologists. Despite the increased awareness of tornadoes, there is still more to learn about their spatial and temporal distribution and, maybe more important, about their impact."
"The former prime minister of Tuvalu, Enele Sopoaga, who hosted Pacific leaders including Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern at the Pacific Islands Forum in August has told a special Pacific edition of Q&A he was “taken aback” by Scott Morrison’s behaviour in the diplomatic meetings. “Unfortunately prime minister Scott Morrison of Australia [was] expressing views that completely denies there is climate change happening already in the Pacific. As chairman I was taken a little bit aback,” he said.  “There was some strong resistance on the call from Pacific Island leaders for more concrete works to reduce greenhouse gases, but to particularly cut down and stop new coalmines in Australia,” said Sopoaga. Throughout the forum Scott Morrison repeatedly spoke of the evident impact of climate change on Tuvalu, but said Australia was a good international partner on climate change and was on track to reduce its emissions in line with Paris targets. The ABC filmed the episode at the University of South Pacific in Fiji’s capital of Suva earlier on Monday, the first time Q&A has been filmed in the Pacific, and one of the few times the program has been filmed outside Australia. The episode was dominated by the climate emergency, as Pacific leaders spoke of the impact on their nations and challenged Australia on its response. In response to a question about the impact of the climate crisis on low-lying islands like his own nation of Tuvalu, Sopoaga said: “If the world doesn’t reduce emissions as called for by the IPCC special report … we will face the situation where island countries like Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands and others will be submerged into the sea by 2060, this is a scary scenario and it is very, very serious. “I certainly hope that not only the Pacific, but those that have polluted the atmosphere and caused global warming will come to react and do the right thing in response to the special report.” Virisila Buadromo, an advocate for women’s and human rights in Fiji, urged Australia to take more action. “I think Australia, as the largest country in the region, the richest country in the region, as well as, you also happen to be the largest emitter of carbon in the region, I think that it’s important that if you are part of our family, you need to stand with our family … to fight against climate change.” I’m Australian. Australia is one of the leaders in the Pacific. Why isn’t the Australian government taking stronger action on climate change? #QandA pic.twitter.com/trcset6I2E Alex Hawke, the minister for international development and the Pacific, defended Australia’s record in this area. “Australia does do a lot on climate change internationally and here in the Pacific as well and we take it very seriously,” he said. “We’re going to meet our targets in Paris, we’ve met our targets in Kyoto, we’re going to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2030 on our 2005 levels, this year we’ll have about 20% of our power generated by renewables and we hope that to be a third by 2020.” While the Fijian attorney general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, was more diplomatic towards Australia, saying that Fiji recognised countries had their own political and economic imperatives, he added: “We need first of all everyone to recognise that actually coalmining is detrimental to the environment, creates climate events and then we need to have a game plan, the game plan is to have a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.” The conversation also touched on illegal fishing; the increased rates of hard drug use and addiction in the Pacific, which is used as a transit point for drugs trafficked to Australia; the influence of China in the region; and the outbreak of measles, which has particularly devastated Samoa, killing 53 people. On China, Alex Hawke said Australia was happy to work with any international partners in the region who had the Pacific’s best interest at heart, and that Australia wasn’t threatened by China’s presence as long as China was focusing on things like health and education and the region’s economic prosperity. “We don’t look at the region through a geo-strategic lens,” he said. “This is the Pacific’s time, there’s certainly a lot of interest in the Pacific and we do have to take account, as a united people in this region, of how to use this time to do better for people in the Pacific, but that doesn’t mean compromising values and sovereignty and I think that’s sometimes where there’s a difference in behaviour. I think people in the Pacific are very savvy people about working out who is coming into the region with their agenda in mind, their priorities in mind versus what’s good for the Pacific countries.” The panel was also asked by an audience member about violence against women. The Pacific has the highest rates of violence against women in the world. Tony Jones threw the question to Buadromo, who quipped: “Because I’m the feminist and I work in women’s rights the assumption is I’m the one who should be combatting violence against women?”  How can we overcome the traditional expectations of women’s “submissiveness” as a factor in growing cases of violence against women? 1/2 #QandA pic.twitter.com/RzybWhRCUq She later took Fiji’s attorney general to task, interrupting him as he outlined his government’s record on domestic violence, saying while legislation now existed to punish perpetrators, that did not stop violence before it happened. “There is a psyche that is perpetuated by your government, your prime minister has perpetuated this psyche where violence is OK, because as we’ve seen in the last couple of weeks, in the last year there have been repeated incidents of people being beaten up by security forces,” she said.  Jones ended the program with a joke at Hawke’s expense, as the minister thanked the ABC for hosting the program in Fiji and said he hoped to see much more of the ABC in the region, with Jones saying: “Give us the funds and we’ll be back.”"

As far as Easter is concerned, there’s a lot of disagreement between the weather models. German weather site wetter.de writes:
Let’s put it this way. For the Easter days the European ECMF model and the American GFS strongly disagree with each other. While the European calculates a powerful high for Easter Monday, The GFS sees a low. The temperature differences are correspondingly different as well.”
One thing we can be sure about is that this March for Central Europe will go down as a cool one, and thus further extending the trend of springs arriving later and later.
The following chart shows March temps for Germany over the past 27 years. Once this year gets factored in, we will see an even greater cooling trend.

"For billions of years, life on Earth remained relatively simple. Only single-celled organisms that could live with little or no oxygen were able to survive in the seas.  Eventually, the rise of oxygen led to a proliferation of diverse, multicellular life. However the oceans have not remained unchanged since that chemical and biological revolution. At several times in geological history, they have partially reverted back to their original bacterially-dominated, oxygen-free state – and they could do so again. Today rising CO2 levels are making the oceans warmer and more acidic. Deforestation and intensive farming are causing soils and nutrients to be flushed into the sea. And increasingly, the oceans are being stripped of oxygen, leaving large “dead zones” in the Gulf of Mexico, the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic off West Africa.  These dead zones, smaller-scale revivals of the primeval oceans that existed before complex life, appear to be caused by poor land management, such as fertilisers draining from farms into the sea. It is a process that could be exacerbated by climate change – as has happened in the past. Oceans lose their oxygen when animals and bacteria consume it faster than it can be replenished. This usually comes about in stagnant or algae-rich waters. In severe cases, all oxygen can be consumed rendering the waters “anoxic” and inhospitable to animal life. This happens today in isolated fjords and basins. And it has happened on a larger scale throughout Earth’s history, especially during the Cretaceous, towards the end of the dinosaur era 145-66m years ago. Then, large parts of the ancient oceans became anoxic, allowing vast amounts of organic matter to escape degradation, and in many cases forming deposits of oil and gas.  We can examine the extent of anoxia by looking for a certain type of “green sulfur bacteria” which require both sunlight and oxygen-depleted waters in order to conduct their rather exotic form of photosynthesis. Evidence of their presence can be found in ancient rocks – molecular proof that anoxia once extended from the seafloor almost all the way to the ocean’s surface. These oceans thrived with microbial life. But animals need oxygen, and vast portions of these ancient oceans would have become “dead” to them. Unlike almost every other ecosystem on our planet, the deep sea is bereft of light and plants. Animals down there largely live off marine snow, the scraps of organic matter that somehow escape from the surface world and sink to the twilight realm below. In this energy-starved world, creatures live solitary lives in emptiness, darkness and mystery.  And yet life is there. Krill thrive on the slowly-sinking snow. Sperm whales dive deep to consume the krill and emerge with scars from giant squid. And when a whale dies and its carcass plummets to the seafloor, it is set upon by sharks and fish who emerge from the darkness for the unexpected feast. Within days the carcass is stripped to the bones – but even then, massive colonies of tube worms spring to life.  All of these animals, the fish, whales and worms, depend on oxygen. Our oxygen-rich seas are an incredible contrast to the North Atlantic during some anoxic events. Then, plesiosaurs (pictured at the top) and ichthyosaurs, feeding on magnificent ammonites, would have been confined to the sunlit, oxygen-rich realm near the surface, their maximum depth of descent marked by a layer of pink and then green water, pigmented by bacteria. And below it, where the deeper waters were anoxic, only single-celled organisms. Conventional wisdom has been that such extreme anoxia in the future is unlikely, that Cretaceous “dead zones” were a consequence of a markedly different geography. The ancient Atlantic Ocean was smaller and more restricted, lending itself to these extreme conditions. This is a bit like the modern Black Sea, a restricted basin where fresh river water sits stably above salty and dense marine deep water.  But the Black Sea doesn’t quite match up with what we know about ancient anoxic oceans. For a start, if driven solely by geographical shape, why were the oceans not anoxic as the norm rather than only at certain times? Sometimes much larger oceans became dead zones, or the anoxia was restricted to coastal areas. And although ocean circulation was slower during warm climates, it did not stop – unlike in the Black Sea. This suggests geography was important but not exclusively so. Algal blooms are a more likely trigger. These algae would have flourished after dramatic increases in nutrients caused by erosion and chemical weathering, driven by higher carbon dioxide concentrations, global warming and/or changes in the hydrological cycle – all of which we now know occurred prior to several anoxic events. It is likely that today’s coastal dead zones are due not to climate change but to our excessive use of fertilisers. And it is unlikely that our future will revisit the widespread ocean anoxia of the past. But the lessons of the past do suggest global warming could exacerbate the impacts of our poor land management, adding yet another pressure to already stressed ecosystems. A longer version of Richard Pancost’s article appears on the Cabot Institute blog."
"Hurricane Ophelia, by then downgraded to Storm Ophelia, reached Ireland on Monday October 16. At the time of writing there had already been three deaths and countless reports of severe damage to buildings and fallen trees. Unlike other severe storms to reach Ireland and Britain, such as the 1987 Great Storm, Ophelia was in many ways a typical tropical cyclone with a tight spiral of cloud, powerfully strong winds, and a cloud-free eye. But what set it apart from other Atlantic hurricanes was its direct route to Europe. While hurricanes do sometimes take a circuitous route westward across the ocean and loop back again towards Europe, this one took a short cut. Ophelia began as a rather innocuous looking group of clouds in the Atlantic Ocean, several hundred miles south-west of the Azores and roughly on the same latitude as Morocco or northern Florida. Yet even at this stage it was unusual. Most named storms in the Atlantic are generated in warmer waters much further south and, as such, they are generally driven across the ocean by the easterly (blowing westwards) trade winds. They eventually dissipate as they curve north into the Atlantic or make landfall in the Caribbean, Mexico or the US.  In Ophelia’s case, moderate atmospheric shear (changes in direction and strength of wind with height) and relatively cool sea surface temperatures meant it took several days to develop the well-defined low pressure centre, strong winds and spiral clouds of a hurricane. Then, instead of travelling west, like most Atlantic hurricanes, Ophelia began to head north-east. This can be explained by the position and strength of the mid-latitude jet stream, an atmospheric feature that plays a major role in determining the weather over Western Europe. When its path loops north over the UK it can produce stable warm conditions in the summer (as in the record-breaking heatwave of July 2015), and bright cold days in the winter. When its path west to east is more direct, it guides low pressure storm systems across the UK and Ireland and can be responsible for the rapid strengthening of storms in a short period of time (described colloquially by forecasters as a “weather bomb”).  It is this that produced such a rapid change in direction for Ophelia. Such waves on the mid-latitude jet stream are not unusual, however, the combination of both the jet’s and Ophelia’s position produced the conditions to guide the ex-hurricane toward the British Isles. Tropical cyclones that form in or travel to the region near the Azores can become trapped. Stronger vertical wind shear to the north and south as well as colder sea surface temperatures in the surroundings can lead to storms that travel very slowly and eventually dissipate due to unfavourable conditions.  If there is no external force that can help to steer the storm, but conditions remain favourable, then tropical cyclones can persist for a long time. An example of this was Hurricane Nadine which circled the same part of the ocean where Ophelia formed for almost a month in 2012, the fourth longest-lived Atlantic hurricane on record. That may have been Ophelia’s fate too, had it not been for the mid-latitude jet stream which instead guided the hurricane directly toward Ireland. It is partly due to this behaviour that the forecasts have been so accurate. Jet streams are generally well represented in numerical weather models, and so their influence on a storm’s path can be well predicted. Ahead of Ophelia’s arrival the UK had a weekend of unseasonably balmy temperatures thanks to warm tropical air driven northwards. This is partly due to the winds circulating around the Ophelia low pressure centre, but also the positioning of the jet stream helping to draw air up from the tropics.  On Monday much of the UK looked far less like a hurricane had arrived, and much more like the whole country had been put through a rosy Instagram filter. The sun was particularly red at dawn and throughout much of the day the whole sky glowed a yellowy-orange.  This effect was partly thanks to the southerly winds on Ophelia’s eastern side, which transported Saharan dust and smoke from Iberian forest fires. In fact several flights over the UK were forced to make emergency landings when smoke could be smelt in the cabin.  Increased number of particles in the atmosphere then scattered light preferentially from the blue end of the spectrum, leaving the more orange and red colours to reach our eyes.  But Ophelia also produced a layer of upper level clouds, thick enough to block out much of the sun’s rays directly but thin enough to allow a large amount of diffuse, scattered light to pass through. On a day when the sky was not full of smoke and dust particles, this would have appeared like a run-of-the-mill white skied, overcast day. However, on Monday it led to Facebook feeds being filled with photos of a bright orange sun at midday and yellow clouds."
"Here’s a good question for Larry Fink, the BlackRock billionaire, to address when he dispatches his lofty annual “dear CEO” letter in the new year. Is his firm guilty of “greenwashing”? In other words, is the world’s biggest fund manager, with an astonishing $7tn of assets under its roof, posing as a pioneer of climate activism while actually dragging its feet? The accusation was made by Sir Christopher Hohn, another fund management billionaire. His hedge fund, TCI, is warning companies to improve their disclosures on carbon emissions and actions to reduce pollution, or face votes against the re-election of directors. But his pointed criticism of BlackRock was almost as significant. Hohn said out loud what others say in private: that Fink’s declared environmental concerns are not matched on the ground by BlackRock’s fund managers. Naturally, BlackRock disputes the characterisation, saying it has “engaged” with 370 companies on “climate risks” in the past two years and arguing it makes the issue one of its “top five priorities”. The firm points out that it was a founder member of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and sent letters to more than 100 of the most carbon-intensive companies last year. Yet the accusation is not that BlackRock is doing nothing. It’s a question of how hard the firm is pushing. One can certainly understand why Hohn could view BlackRock’s voting record on climate-related resolutions as “appalling”, as he put it to the FT. InfluenceMap and ShareAction, two research groups, agreed in recent reports that Fink’s firm backs only about 10% of climate-related resolutions tabled by shareholders, whereas big European names such as Legal & General and UBS are in the 80%-90% range. BlackRock would protest that you can’t judge a fund manager solely by its record. But, even on regular day-to-day dealings with companies, fingers are being pointed. This territory is hard to measure since “engagement” means conversations with corporate managements that take place behind closed doors but InfluenceMap looked at what fund managers say themselves. It concluded that, among the world’s top 15 asset managers only Allianz, L&G and UBS “strongly and consistently” try to change business models in line with Paris Agreement targets. BlackRock, as well as fellow US giants Vanguard and State Street, was deemed to be in the slow camp of managers that call on companies to consider climate risks but “do not drive behaviour change around climate models or policy lobbying”. Fink may still feel that BlackRock’s reputation as a laggard is unfair. If so, he has the ideal platform to address the accusation of soft-pedalling. His letter to fellow chief executives generates acres of coverage every year and, if he wishes to issue a blistering call for corporations to act faster to tackle the climate emergency, he is free to do so. If he named a few names, instead of issuing bland generalities about the importance of companies having a “purpose”, so much the better. He is also free, of course, to get heavier on the voting front. BlackRock is so big it owns stakes of 5%-plus in many large companies, which can be enough to make or break an investor rebellion on a climate issue. Most of all, Fink should know that Hohn was echoing a common sentiment, at least in Europe: that BlackRock is increasingly part of the problem. Another day, another item for the non-executive directors at Ted Baker to investigate. This one concerns the overstatement of the value of the inventory on the balance sheet. Suspected inflation of £20m to £25m equates to about 10% of the stock value shown in the last balance sheet. It’s a bad look, which is why the shares, which had already collapsed by three-quarters this year, fell another 8%. Mind you, a balance sheet overstatement may not be the most pressing concern. On the value front, say the critics, the real worry is the price of Ted’s clothes in the shops."
"The world’s leaders are meeting – again – for talks on climate change. This year’s Conference of the Parties (the 23rd, hence COP23) to the United Nations climate treaty in Bonn, Germany, is not expected to be a deal-clinching, make-or-break one like Paris in 2015 or Copenhagen in 2009. That doesn’t make it insignificant – the hope is that negotiators will make meaningful progress on implementing the provisions of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Countries have agreed that they want a whole range of operational rules, deliberately left vague in Paris, to be agreed by the 2018 COP in Katowice, Poland. These include rules over financing for climate adaptation in developing countries, and for a new market mechanism to help implementation of the agreement, among others. Climate negotiations typically involve several years of glacial progress followed by a flurry of extraordinary spectacle, involving negotiators staying up for two days straight to get a deal done. This dynamic is exhausting, and usually produces distinctly underwhelming results announced with great fanfare, along with the launch of yet another a new initiative or network. It all invites a weary cynicism about what we expect the UN process to achieve. But if the Paris Agreement is to be anything other than a farce, it must avoid the sort of design which needs heroic politicians parachuting in once every five years. Rather, it needs countries to pay attention, to continue working patiently, revising and improving their strategies to “bend the curve” on emissions and deal with the mess that climate change is already causing. Here then are five things that should happen: Parties – nearly 200 countries plus the EU – could explicitly recognise that the “net-zero” emissions goal in the Paris Agreement means the end of fossil fuels.  What would that mean in practice? They’d make substantive policy announcements with serious effects, like eliminating fossil fuel subsidies – which even the IMF thinks are out of hand – or a coal phase-out by 2025. They’d also begin to think through how to arrange serious funding for renewables, the electrification of motorised transport and a ramping up of “technology transfer”. Parties could agree that their commitments to cut emissions, known as “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs), are inadequate and announce revised and more aggressive ones. It was clear from the outset that these emissions cuts, taken together, would still see the world shoot past the 2°C target, let alone a 1.5°C one. Collectively, they could agree to accelerate the process of reviewing these commitments but to trigger this, countries seeking to lead would need to do this unilaterally. Industrialised countries could announce new investments in the Green Climate Fund. There are lots of fine words about this fund, but richer nations have not put their money where their mouths are. It was supposed to be raising US$100 billion a year by 2020, but countries have so far put in just over US$10 billion in total (and that includes US$3 billion from the US, whose status is now threatened by US president, Donald Trump).  This is hopelessly inadequate in the face of the need to both finance zero-carbon development in developing countries and help those already facing “loss and damage” from climate change. New and substantial cheques and means to simulate private financing of low-carbon development are needed. Parties could agree on certain rules a year ahead of schedule. Last year, at COP22 in Marrakech, it was decided those rules that had been left vague needed to be agreed on by 2018, in order to help the first stocktake of progress in implementing the agreement.  These things tend to take a long time. Take the example of the market mechanism, for instance (article 6 of the agreement). After they were introduced in the Kyoto protocol of 1997 it took a further four years for everyone to agree on their operational rules. This is all too slow. Now we have those earlier models to draw on, quicker progress would be a sign they are getting on with things. Parties could explicitly accept that “negative emissions” technologies are no substitute for aiming for zero emissions.  The idea of “net-zero” emissions – and many of the IPCC’s scenarios – increasingly rely on weird and wonderful technologies to take carbon out of the atmosphere. The latest of these is Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage: you grow plants, which absorb CO₂, then burn them in power stations to generate electricity, capture the emitted carbon and store it underground. The trouble is, no-one knows if it can really work – but, at the same time, many are using this as a sort of magical escape clause to avoid the end of fossil fuels (see 1 above). A recognition that this is wishful thinking would be useful. All five of the above are pretty unlikely. The chances are that negotiations will continue along the path of nothing happening until the last minute (if then). But here’s one that will almost certainly happen, but will be largely meaningless. The Climate Action Leadership Network, already announced at the UN Climate week in September will be fully launched, as the latest in a set of such efforts to keep up the semblance of momentum in the negotiations. Meanwhile, renewable energy technology will drop in price independently of all the fine words, and atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide will continue to grow."
"Hot weather increases the risk of early childbirth, which in turn is linked to worse health and developmental outcomes for children, a major new study has found. The report could have fresh implications for the impact of global heating on human health.  In the US, about 25,000 babies were born up to two weeks early each year as a result of heatwaves between 1969 and 1988, according to the research published in Nature Climate Change (NCC). Childbirth rates increased by 5% on days when temperatures reached 90F, but access to air conditioning mitigated three-quarters of the impact of heat exposure. Across the world, hot days are getting hotter and more frequent as a result of global heating. If greenhouse gas emissions are not significantly curtailed, by the end of the century the National Climate Assessment estimates there will be up to 30 more days over 90F each year in the US. Another study projects that the annual number of days above 100F will double. In the NCC study, researchers analysed 56 million births in counties across the US – the most comprehensive investigation into the correlation between temperature and gestation. The average gestation period – or full term pregnancy – is 40 weeks. While very premature babies face the biggest medical challenges, multiple longitudinal studies demonstrate that late preterm (babies born at 34 to 36 weeks) and early term (37 to 38 weeks) deliveries pose a significant risk to survival, growth and development. In later life, these slightly early babies are more likely to have respiratory problems and higher blood pressure, as well as an increased risk of psychiatric and neurological conditions. Academic outcomes are also negatively affected in early babies, according to a millennium cohort study of 6,000 British children. Globally, late preterm and early term babies already account for a third of all births, with numbers in the US rising. Unless action is taken to mitigate the risks, by the end of the century an additional 42,000 babies will be delivered early annually in the US. The study concludes: “Increased exposure to hot weather with climate change is likely to harm infant health.” “Electrification and access to air conditioning should be a part of any effort to protect pregnant women and infants in developing countries,” said Allan Barreca, lead researcher with the University of California’s Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. “But developed countries, like the US or England, should be paying developing countries to electrify with renewable sources, like wind or solar, so we avoid producing more greenhouse gas emissions.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterRecall how man-made CO2 emissions are supposed to cause a greenhouse effect in the troposphere, meaning the stratosphere above it is supposed to cool. Lately, that has not been the case at all – at least over the northern hemisphere, 65°N and above, over the better part of the last year.
Schneefan here writes on an interesting phenomenon now taking place in the Arctic stratosphere. Much of what follows is a translation, along with some points I’ve added myself.
The upper stratosphere over the Arctic, her writes, has never been so warm in March since satellite records began back in 1979: a sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) with an expected splitting of the polar vortex is underway (polar vortex split).

The plot above shows the sudden warming (red line) on March 7, 2016 (day 67 of the year) occurring in the upper stratosphere at 10 hPa (approx. 30 km altitude), between 65°N and 90°N. The red line significantly surpassed the high mark (upper black line) for March and is far above average (line with green dots). Source: www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/. 
Through the strong warming and related pressure increase, a warm high has formed over the Arctic in place of the cold polar vortex. This means the polar vortex will split over the coming days and get displaced southwards – (polar vortex split):

ECMWF projection of March 8, 2016 for temperatures in the upper atmosphere at 10 hPa (approx. 30 km altitude) for March 16, 2016. The polar vortex has split due to the high pressure caused by the sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) over the pole. Two completely separated cold cores form over Siberia and Western Europe/North Atlantic. At this latitude the zonal wind has reversed from west to east. Source: http://www.geo.fu-berlin.html. 
When there is a reversal in the temperature gradient and circulation (west wind shifts to east wind) from 60°N latitiude to the North Pole at in 10 hPa (approx. 30,000 m altitude), this is known as a major warming. Whether or not this ushers in a “final warming” and thus a switch from the Arctic winter to a summertime circulation remains to be seen…
The SSW and expected polar vortex splitting along with the reversal of zonal winds from west to east will also have major impacts on the circulation of air masses at the lower atmospheric levels of the northern hemisphere. The polar jet will meander and lead to enhanced exchange between polar and subtropical air masses: That means more cold air blasts into the middle latitudes are expected for the northern hemisphere.
The ECMWF prognosis from 9 March 20016 consequently sees an intensified March winter 2016 over large parts of Europe. Wintry temperatures at 850 hPa (approx. 1500 m) of -10°C on March 19,2016 over eastern Europe:

ECMWF forecast of March 9, 2016, for temperatures on March 19, 2016, in Europe. Cold Siberian air is expected to flow across Europe between high pressure positioned over the North Atlantic and a low over Russia and southern Europe. Source: www.wetterzentrale.de/html
These unusually cold calculations have been more or less confirmed by other weather models over the past few days. But as everyone knows, forecasts 10 days out are fraught with considerable uncertainty, and so we should not lose hope for milder spring weather.
Yet, this year it looks like we’ll have to wait a little longer than normal. But that shouldn’t surprise us, though, because statistics show that spring has been arriving later and later in Europe over the past 2 decades – and not earlier.

"Are we facing insect Armageddon? A recent study found that German nature reserves have seen a 75% reduction in flying insects over the last 27 years. The researchers involved made stark warnings that this indicated a wider collapse of the general insect population that would bring about an ecological catastrophe if left unchecked. But is this an over-dramatisation of a single study in one country, or is there some real cause for concern? Here we answer five questions about how important this result is and whether we should be worried. The idea of going out on a beautiful afternoon for a picnic and not having any wasps buzzing around might sound actually quite appealing, so why worry about insect decline? Well, besides annoying us, insects are a key link in many food chains. They are the main resources for many birds, small mammals, reptiles and other creatures. They are also key for human food production, since many of our crops depend on insects for the pollination that leads to fruit and seed production. And insects play a very important role in decomposing organic matter, which allows nutrients to return to the soil and support the next year’s crops. So, in terms of insect’s ecological importance, a sharp decline in their abundance should be of great concern. Different from previous studies, this study monitored insect biomass. What this means is that we do not know what specific kinds of insects are declining (although the data collected will allow this analysis in the future). Nor do we know if all kinds of insects are declining equally. We also do not know if the problem is that insects are getting smaller or whether there are fewer of them. But this approach provides a better estimate of the scale of the problem, even if it doesn’t show the specific details. For example, whether the insects are getting smaller or fewer in number, the decline would have just as big an impact on bird diets. Previous studies looked mostly at one particular group of insects, and an argument about why a particular group was at risk overshadows the bigger question of whether this is a general problem. The new study suggests there is a very large, general problem. The study is the result of a collaboration with the Entomological Society of Krefeld – essentially made up of members of the public. This is a perfect demonstration of how we can collect much more data by involving interested members of the public, also known as “citizen science”.  Under current research funding models that usually only consider projects between one and five years in length, it’s not possible to run a university-based study for a project on this scale (64 locations over 27 years). So without the dedication of insect enthusiasts, we would not even know about this problem.   The data analysis was supported by a very good team of university scientists, so there should be no concern about the results. Instead we should consider whether the current funding models for research and the focus this creates can miss some crucial aspects of ecological science that have potentially very detrimental effects. There are no comparable studies in other countries so any discussion of whether the results are applicable elsewhere would be purely speculative. This is especially true because we don’t know the cause of the decline.  But there is plenty of evidence that supports the idea that insect populations are under threat globally. For example a 2014 study indicated a 45% decline in insect abundance on the majority of the worldwide monitored locations. The main problem with this study is that it does not help us find possible causes for such drastic decline. The researchers considered some aspects of vegetation and some climate variables, and neither seemed to be the main cause. The fact that the decline was observed in nature reserves is particularly worrying, since it suggests that the decline might be even worse elsewhere. And the fact that we can detect the decline over a number of different reserves suggests that the cause isn’t just a localised event. Possible answers include the industrial scale use of pesticides (which might not be as safe as previously thought, or the increase in farms dedicated to a single crop and deforestation that is associated with this (which may not sustain as many insect species). The next step is to work out exactly what’s going on so we can attempt to reverse this worrying trend."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAt German climate and weather site wobleibtdieerderwaerumund.de here, author “Schneefan” writes about the Arctic stratosphere and potential polar vortices blasting into Europe before winter makes an exit.
He writes that models had calculated a warming of the stratosphere over parts of the Arctic, and this is now indeed taking place. And that warming has been strong and rapid. What does such an upper atmosphere warming mean? Schneefan writes it leads to a disturbed polar circulation, which leads us “to expect additional cold surprises over the earth’s northern hemisphere“.

Moreover at the upper stratosphere at about 30 km elevation (10 hPa) the rash warming has been interrupted, as the following chart depicts:

The interrupted upper stratosphere warming eventually led to the interruption working its way down to the lower stratosphere 18 km altitude (70 hPa) just a bit later:

This warming of the stratosphere over the Arctic leads to a negative Arctic Oscillation (AO), Schneefan writes, which in turn leads to polar vortices plowing down into the middle latitudes, as was the case in mid January, 2016.

Yet the prognosis for the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) – contrary to the the (cold) values seen in January – remains slightly in the positive range, which would point to mild weather just ahead for Western and Central Europe:

However stratospheric prognoses point to a continued tendency toward a major warming/SSW) already in just a few days, which would mean that in 3 to 10 days colder weather for Western and Central Europe:

The cold polar vortex is positioned over eastern Greenland.  The cold pole of the northern hemisphere is over Scotland (C=Cold). The cold pole is set to shift over Europe. Source: www.geo.fu-berlin.de/met/ag/strat/produktehtml.
Such major warmings of the stratosphere last happened in 2012 and 2013 – in January, after which a very cold February followed in 2012, and an historically severe cold March gripped Europe in 2013 respectively.

Cold February of 2012. Source: www.esrl.noaa.gov/.
 

Historic cold March of 2013. Source: www.esrl.noaa.gov/.
So, Schneefan writes, Europeans should not be writing off the winter just yet, as many meteorologists seem to have been doing over the past week or so. Weather is always a big bag filled with surprises. Things can go from mild to brutally cold awfully quickly.

"The US will take action on greenhouse gases and engage with other countries on the climate emergency despite Donald Trump’s rejection of international cooperation, a delegation from the US Congress has told the UN climate conference in Madrid. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, struck a defiant stance on Monday, declaring: “Congress’s commitment to action on the climate crisis is iron-clad. This is a matter of public health, of clean air, of clean water, of our children, of the survival of our economies, of the prosperity of the world, of national security, justice and equality. We now must deliver deeper cuts in emissions.”  Her rallying call came as developing countries accused the US president of “ecocide” and the UN secretary-general said the world’s biggest emitters were falling behind. Ministers and officials from more than 190 countries gathered in Madrid on Monday for the start of two weeks of talks aimed at ironing out technical details of the 2015 Paris agreement, which needs to be completed for nations to focus on the progress on cutting carbon emissions. “We are outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris agreement,” Lois Young, Belize’s permanent representative to the UN and chair of the Alliance of Small Island Developing States, told the conference.  “In the midst of a climate emergency, retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect the most vulnerable.” António Guterres, the UN secretary general, also called for more action from the US, the world’s second biggest emitter after China, warning that some of the world’s biggest economies were failing to cut carbon fast enough.  “We see already strong commitment from many governments and the business and financial community – the problem is that the most important polluters, the countries that have the biggest [emissions of] greenhouse gases are lagging behind.” He praised the EU for its plans to cut emissions drastically by 2030, and cited China, India, Japan and the US as countries needing to join in to meet the challenge. “This is also an issue for public opinion, for youth and civil society, for cities and regions – we see everywhere a new determination that makes me hopeful,” he added. “I’m hopeful, but not yet entirely sure as there is still a long way to go and we are still lagging behind.” The opening of the two weeks of talks, called COP25, was a more subdued affair than usual because the venue was forced to change a few weeks ago from Santiago in Chile after violence and political upheaval erupted. Activists and campaigners assembled inside the conference and outside, but there was a lack of the pageantry and passion that have characterised recent COPs, galvanised by the signing of the Paris accord in 2016, seen as paving the way to international cooperation and preventing dangerous temperature rises. Progress since then has been slow, and emissions have continued to rise while most countries have failed to propose the tougher targets needed to fulfil the goals of the Paris agreement. Meanwhile, scientific warnings have grown more urgent and extreme weather events have struck home the dangers of climate chaos. Several countries have also elected leaders hostile to the Paris accord and action on emissions, including Australia, Brazil and the US. Trump deposited the legal instruments needed to formally withdraw from the Paris agreement last month, which will take effect next November. But the US will continue to have a seat at the table of UN climate negotiations, as he has not withdrawn from the foundational treaty, called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Pelosi and other members of the US congressional delegation – which has no formal role at the talks – also played down perceptions of a rift between more leftwing Democrats who favour a “green new deal” that would eliminate emissions from 2030, and those behind a bill that would legislate for net zero carbon by 2050. Frank Pallone, sponsor of the 2050 bill, said there was “nothing inconsistent” about the two, as moving to renewable energy by 2030 would allow other sources of emissions, such as agriculture and some industries, to take longer to reduce. “None of this is inconsistent – we need to dispel the notion that we are not incorporating the green new deal,” he said. Pelosi added: “This is not about incrementalism – this is about being transformative.”"
"It is rare to encounter a scientific fact that stirs widespread debate and distrust quite like the matter of climate change. Despite consensus among climate specialists about a theory that is supported by a mountain of facts from the physical, natural, and cultural sciences, the debate continues to be perpetrated by politicians, industrialists, academics, and armchair scientists. When governments reject science, the rest of us are put at risk. By refusing to accept the facts and potential ramifications of climate change, as a society, we stand to delay or overlook actions that are urgently needed to reduce our impact on the environment and adapt our cities and farmlands to a different future. Much of the intense scepticism about climate change science began in 2009, when thousands of emails and data files were stolen from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, in the UK, and later exposed under the guise of a purported conspiracy to alter facts. The allegations claimed that scientists had only publicised results in support of their theory that climate change is driven by human activities. Other facts, that may negate this claim, were said to have been hidden. A series of inquiries found no evidence that these scientists were in the wrong, though the investigations did generally call for more transparency. Selective reporting is indeed a serious issue in the scientific community, especially when it comes to theory building as theories require consideration of all available facts. Is it possible that the theory of climate change is based on a biased selection of facts? We decided to find out. But what exactly is publication bias? If researchers only publish results that confirm their specific view or previous expectations or hopes, then the bulk of results in this research field will be skewed towards that established belief. For example, if a researcher is developing a medical drug to treat a disease, then all results of the clinical trial should be made public for the benefit of other researchers seeking the same cure. We know that, in medicine, positive and statistically significant results are more likely to be published than non-results. This poses a risk to medical sciences as failed experiments that are not reported may lead other researchers to waste precious funds pursuing dead-ends. Moreover, if only positive results are published, people will think the drug may be more effective than it truly is. Fortunately, there are established methods in numerical ecology and statistics that allow us to detect when non-significant results are missing from a field of research. One such method is the “Fail-safe N” (or sometimes called “the file-drawer problem”). This refers to the practice of only publishing positive results but filing away studies with negative or non-confirmative results. Statistically we can calculate the fail-safe N, that estimates how many negative studies would be required to make the statistical effect insignificant. This means that if publication bias was occurring in climate change science, we could detect it through “missing” negative results. In our research, published in the journal Climatic Change, we analysed more than 1,100 published results from the field of climate change science and found no evidence of under-reporting or missing results – even results that were not statistically significant or showing no positive effects were reported. Our study revealed some stylistic biases in how articles are written, however. The largest, most prominent effects (as they relate to climate change) were reported in the upfront summary sections (also called the abstract) where they are most readily seen by readers, whereas the lesser effects and those that were not significant tended to be buried within the technical results sections where relatively few readers are likely to see them. Stylistic biases are less concerning than a systematic tendency to under-report non-significant effects, assuming researchers read entire reports before formulating theories. However, most audiences, especially non-scientists including journalists who report on the findings, are more likely to read abstracts or summary paragraphs only, without perusing technical results. The onus to effectively communicate science does not fall entirely on the reader; rather, it is the responsibility of scientists and editors to remain vigilant, to understand how biases may pervade their work, and to be proactive about communicating science to non-technical audiences in transparent and unbiased ways. It is important to stress that we are not climate scientists. Rather, in this instance, we functioned as scientists holding climate scientists to account and tested to see if their reporting practices were sound. Although climate scientists tend to highlight their most interesting results in the abstract of their articles, something that is hardly unique to their field, we can be confident that the theory of climate change is built on a solid foundation that gives credence to positive, neutral, and negative experimental results. In scientific terms, we reject the accusation made by climate change sceptics and can confirm that there is no publication bias in climate change research. This article is co-published with ScienceNordic and in Danish on ForskerZonen. It was co-written with Christian Harlos, formerly at Lund University and now working in local government marine conservation, and Tim Edgell, an ecologist for consultancy Stantec.

"Lilawati Awasthi is used to the risks that come from living in a remote mountainous district in the far west of Nepal. Floods, landslides and treacherous roads are a part of daily life. But this year she faced a new hazard: mosquitoes carrying a mystery illness. When she began to feel sick in September she was not overly concerned at first. “I thought it was a simple fever, but it wouldn’t go away,” says the 50-year-old. “We went to the hospital and it turned out I was suffering from dengue.” Awasthi is one of more than 14,000 Nepalis who have been diagnosed with dengue fever since May, in an unprecedented outbreak that has left health professionals and the government reeling. Some experts believe the actual number of infections to be closer to 140,000. Six people have died. Dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection with symptoms similar to severe flu, first appeared in Nepal in 2004. Minor outbreaks have occurred periodically, largely restricted to the country’s tropical southern plains and some urban areas. This year’s outbreak has been remarkable both in its scale and reach. Dengue has been found in 67 of Nepal’s 77 districts, including those at higher elevations, a trend experts say is linked to the climate  crisis. “The role of climate change in poor countries where the health system is not robust is very big,” says Meghnath Dhimal, chief research officer at the Nepal Health Research Council. “There has been a rapid geographical expansion of dengue, especially from the lowland to the highland.” Almost 2,000 cases have been recorded in the Kathmandu Valley, which at 1,400 metres sits higher than Britain’s tallest peak, Ben Nevis. A combination of factors are behind this year’s outbreak: prolonged and heavy monsoon rains and rising temperatures, alongside rapid urbanisation and population movement. Road expansion has created opportunities for the virus to move to higher altitudes, spread by infected people and mosquitoes carried in vehicles. Once mosquitoes reach higher elevations where they would normally perish, rising temperatures enable them to survive, says Dhimal. “We have found that mosquitoes are now able to establish a population at up to 2,000 metres.” Awasthi is the first person to contract dengue in her village, says her husband, Ram Dutta. “It really worries me that new diseases like dengue are becoming common. This area is getting hotter each year. There used to be very few mosquitoes before, but they are becoming common these days.” You get headaches, pain in the back and joints, nausea. The pain is intolerable The growth of dengue in Nepal follows a global trend that has seen the number of infections grow rapidly to an estimated 390m a year, according to the World Health Organization. The UN body says about half the world’s population is now at risk. At the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease hospital in Kathmandu, the director, Basu Dev Pandey, is worried about the future. “It could be a disaster. During the peak of this year’s outbreak it was so difficult: 10,000 people came to the hospital. There was dengue-phobia.” Pandey says the number of recorded cases in Nepal this year is a “gross underestimate” because the symptoms of dengue are similar to a typical fever. “Many people just visit the local pharmacy for treatment, and in Kathmandu the majority of patients go to private hospitals, whose data is not included in the government’s statistics.” At the height of the outbreak the hospital was overrun with patients. “People were lying on the ground all over the place. They just collapsed on the spot,” says Lal Bahadur Waiba, who works in the outpatient department. “The crowd was so big we had to open at 7am and set up stalls on the street outside.” Waiba and 13 other hospital staff contracted dengue themselves. “You get headaches, pain in the back and joints, nausea. The pain is intolerable,” he says. At the same time, mass migration to urban areas has resulted in overcrowded cities with poor infrastructure and haphazard waste management. A weak health system and a lack of public awareness combine to create the conditions where dengue can thrive. Without access to piped water, many urban dwellers get their water from communal pumps and store it in buckets indoors, which makes an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. “Even a discarded noodle packet can hold enough rainwater for the larvae to breed,” says Pandey.  A huge public awareness programme is needed, says Dhimal. “There may be a big outbreak in the future. The message is clear, we have to start right now.”"
"Climate models have accurately predicted global heating for the past 50 years, a study has found. The findings confirm that since as early as 1970, climate scientists have had a solid fundamental understanding of the Earth’s climate system and the ability to project how it will respond to continued increases in the greenhouse effect. Since climate models have accurately anticipated global temperature changes so far, we can expect projections of future warming to be reliable as well. The research examines the accuracy of 17 models published over the past five decades, beginning with a 1970 study and including 1981 and 1988 models led by James Hansen, the former Nasa climatologist who testified to the US Senate in 1988 about the impacts of anthropogenic global heating. The study also includes the first four reports by the UN’s intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC). “We found that climate models – even those published back in the 1970s – did remarkably well, with 14 out of the 17 model projections indistinguishable from what actually occurred,” said Zeke Hausfather, of the University of California, Berkeley, and lead author of the paper, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Fossil fuel companies have been aware of their impact on the planet since at least the 1950s The physicist Edward Teller tells the American Petroleum Institute (API) a 10% increase in CO2 will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. “I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe.” Lyndon Johnson’s President’s Science Advisory Committee states that “pollutants have altered on a global scale the carbon dioxide content of the air”, with effects that “could be deleterious from the point of view of human beings”. Summarising the findings, the head of the API warned the industry: “Time is running out.” Shell and BP begin funding scientific research in Britain this decade to examine climate impacts from greenhouse gases. A recently filed lawsuit claims Exxon scientists told management in 1977 there was an “overwhelming” consensus that fossil fuels were responsible for atmospheric carbon dioxide increases. An internal Exxon memo warns “it is distinctly possible” that CO2 emissions from the company’s 50-year plan “will later produce effects which will indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the Earth’s population)”. The Nasa scientist James Hansen testifies to the US Senate that “the greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now”. In the US presidential campaign, George Bush Sr says: “Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect forget about the White House effect … As president, I intend to do something about it.” A confidential report prepared for Shell’s environmental conservation committee finds CO2 could raise temperatures by 1C to 2C over the next 40 years with changes that may be “the greatest in recorded history”. It urges rapid action by the energy industry. “By the time the global warming becomes detectable it could be too late to take effective countermeasures to reduce the effects or even stabilise the situation,” it states. Exxon, Shell, BP and other fossil fuel companies establish the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), a lobbying group that challenges the science on global warming and delays action to reduce emissions. Exxon funds two researchers, Dr Fred Seitz and Dr Fred Singer, who dispute the mainstream consensus on climate science. Seitz and Singer were previously paid by the tobacco industry and questioned the hazards of smoking. Singer, who has denied being on the payroll of the tobacco or energy industry, has said his financial relationships do not influence his research. Shell’s public information film Climate of Concern acknowledges there is a “possibility of change faster than at any time since the end of the ice age, change too fast, perhaps, for life to adapt without severe dislocation”. At the Rio Earth summit, countries sign up to the world’s first international agreement to stabilise greenhouse gases and prevent dangerous manmade interference with the climate system. This establishes the UN framework convention on climate change. Bush Sr says: “The US fully intends to be the pre-eminent world leader in protecting the global environment.” Two month’s before the Kyoto climate conference, Mobil (later merged with Exxon) takes out an ad in The New York Times titled Reset the Alarm, which says: “Let’s face it: the science of climate change is too uncertain to mandate a plan of action that could plunge economies into turmoil.” The US refuses to ratify the Kyoto protocol after intense opposition from oil companies and the GCC. The US senator Jim Inhofe, whose main donors are in the oil and gas industry, leads the “Climategate” misinformation attack on scientists on the opening day of the crucial UN climate conference in Copenhagen, which ends in disarray. A study by Richard Heede, published in the journal Climatic Change, reveals 90 companies are responsible for producing two-thirds of the carbon that has entered the atmosphere since the start of the industrial age in the mid-18th century. The API removes a claim on its website that the human contribution to climate change is “uncertain”, after an outcry. Exxon, Chevron and BP each donate at least $500,000 for the inauguration of Donald Trump as president. Mohammed Barkindo, secretary general of Opec, which represents Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Iran and several other oil states, says climate campaigners are the biggest threat to the industry and claims they are misleading the public with unscientific warnings about global warming. Jonathan Watts Based on modern climate model projections, if countries follow through with current and pledged climate policies, the world is on track for about 3C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures by 2100 – a situation the IPCC and others predict would be catastrophic. The challenge in evaluating climate model accuracy lies in the fact that due to computing power limitations, simulations are only run for a few specific future greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. There are an infinite number of such possible scenarios, but real-world emissions will follow only one path, and it will never exactly match the few scenarios input into climate models. Thus, if Earth warms less than in a climate model projection, it does not necessarily mean the model was inaccurate. Put simply, climate scientists are not in the business of predicting human fossil fuel consumption but are attempting to accurately simulate how the climate will change in response to a given rise in greenhouse gas emissions. “Future emissions depend on human behaviour, not physical systems, and climate models should be evaluated on their physics rather than the future emission projections,” said Hausfather. In nearly half of the model projections examined in the paper, the input scenarios were significantly different from the real-world changes in greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, projected temperature changes were only consistent with observed global warming in 10 of the 17 models, with four projecting more warming and three projecting less than subsequently occurred. However, the study authors addressed these inconsistencies by evaluating the change in temperature per change in “radiative forcing” – the global energy imbalance caused by the increased greenhouse effect and other factors – in models against what happened in the real world. This metric reveals whether the climate models are accurately producing the temperature response to a given emissions change – in essence, whether are accurately simulating the physical response of Earth’s climate system. With this factored in, 14 of the 17 models were accurate. “The rate of warming we are experiencing today is pretty much exactly what past climate models projected it would be,” said Hausfather. Those who oppose policies to limit the impacts of global heating have long sought to undermine the credibility of climate models. If the model projections are considered unreliable, they argue, then we do not know how urgent slowing global warming is. As a result, “climate models are unreliable” has become a popular myth propagated by climate deniers. The latest study adds to the body of evidence supporting the accuracy of climate models, and will be welcomed by those arguing that more aggressive climate policies are needed to avoid dangerous levels of global warming. The UN climate summit in Glasgow in 2020 will be crucial, as countries will be expected to commit to scaling up the emission reductions that were pledged in the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change."
"Few places on earth are as well known for their so-called mysteries as Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui. For a tiny island of 64 square miles, with its nearest neighbours some 1,300 miles away, it has seen more than its fair share of controversy.  For a long while it wasn’t clear whether the island’s native population originated in Polynesia or South America. And how can we explain its apparent paradox: the design, construction and transport of giant “moai” stone statues, a remarkable cultural achievement yet one carried out on a virtually barren island, which seemingly lacked both the resources and people to carry out such a feat? Anthropologists have long wondered whether these seemingly simple inhabitants really had the capacity for such cultural complexity. Or was a more advanced population, perhaps from the Americas, actually responsible – one that subsequently wiped out all the natural resources the island once had?  Recently, Rapa Nui has become the ultimate parable for humankind’s selfishness; a moral tale of the dangers of environmental destruction. In the “ecocide” hypothesis popularised by the geographer Jared Diamond, Rapa Nui is used as a demonstration of how society is doomed to collapse if we do not sit up and take note. But more than 60 years of archaeological research actually paints a very different picture – and now new genetic data sheds further light on the island’s fate. It is time to demystify Rapa Nui. The ecocide hypothesis centres on two major claims. First, that the island’s population was reduced from several tens of thousands in its heyday, to a diminutive 1,500-3,000 when Europeans first arrived in the early 18th century. Second, that the palm trees that once covered the island were callously cut down by the Rapa Nui population to move statues. With no trees to anchor the soil, fertile land eroded away resulting in poor crop yields, while a lack of wood meant islanders couldn’t build canoes to access fish or move statues. This led to internecine warfare and, ultimately, cannibalism. The question of population size is one we still cannot convincingly answer. Most archaeologists agree on estimates somewhere between 4,000 and 9,000 people, although a recent study looked at likely agricultural yields and suggested the island could have supported up to 15,000.  But there is no real evidence of a population decline prior to the first European contact in 1722. Ethnographic reports from the early 20th century provide oral histories of warfare between competing island groups. The anthropologist Thor Heyerdahl – most famous for crossing the Pacific in a traditional Inca boat – took these reports as evidence for a huge civil war that culminated in a battle of 1680, where the majority of one of the island’s tribes was killed. Obsidian flakes or “mata’a” littering the island have been interpreted as weapon fragments testifying to this violence.  However, recent research lead by Carl Lipo has shown that these were more likely domestic tools or implements used for ritual tasks. Surprisingly few of the human remains from the island show actual evidence of injury, just 2.5%, and most of those showed evidence of healing, meaning that attacks were not fatal. Crucially, there is no evidence, beyond historical word-of-mouth, of cannibalism. It’s debatable whether 20th century tales can really be considered reliable sources for 17th-century conflicts. More recently, a picture has emerged of a prehistoric population that was both successful and lived sustainably on the island up until European contact. It is generally agreed that Rapa Nui, once covered in large palm trees, was rapidly deforested soon after its initial colonisation around 1200 AD. Although micro-botanical evidence, such as pollen analysis, suggests the palm forest disappeared quickly, the human population may only have been partially to blame.  The earliest Polynesian colonisers brought with them another culprit, namely the Polynesian rat. It seems likely that rats ate both palm nuts and sapling trees, preventing the forests from growing back. But despite this deforestation, my own research on the diet of the prehistoric Rapanui found they consumed more seafood and were more sophisticated and adaptable farmers than previously thought.  So what – if anything – happened to the native population for its numbers to dwindle and for statue carving to end? And what caused the reports of warfare and conflict in the early 20th century?  The real answer is more sinister. Throughout the 19th century, South American slave raids took away as much as half of the native population. By 1877, the Rapanui numbered just 111. Introduced disease, destruction of property and enforced migration by European traders further decimated the natives and lead to increased conflict among those remaining. Perhaps this, instead, was the warfare the ethnohistorical accounts refer to and what ultimately stopped the statue carving. It had been thought that South Americans made contact with Rapa Nui centuries before the Europeans, as their DNA can be detected in modern native inhabitants. I have been involved in a new study, however, led by paleogeneticist Lars Fehren-Schmitz, which questions this timeline. We analysed Rapanui human remains dating to before and after European contact. Our work, published in the journal Current Biology, found no significant gene flow between South America and Easter Island before 1722. Instead, the considerable recent disruption to the island’s population may have impacted on modern DNA.   Perhaps, then, the takeaway from Rapa Nui should not be a story of ecocide and a Malthusian population collapse. Instead, it should be a lesson in how sparse evidence, a fixation with “mysteries”, and a collective amnesia for historic atrocities caused a sustainable and surprisingly well-adapted population to be falsely blamed for their own demise. And those statues? We know how they moved them; the local population knew all along. They walked – all we needed to do was ask."
"Can a forest be fascist? This may seem a facetious question, but it is one that Italians have been discussing of late due to a fire that occurred at the end of August. The fire, allegedly started accidently by someone cooking tomato sauce, burned down part of a historic and controversial forest on the slopes of Mount Giano, about 100km north-east of Rome. The 20,000 fir trees here, spread over eight hectares, were planted between 1938 and 1939 by recruits studying at the academy of the forestry corps in the small town of Cittaducale. They were a homage to Mussolini: planted in such a way so that from afar, they read DUX, the fascist leader’s title in Latin. And some want to replant it.  This story brings effectively together two major recent issues of debate: forest fires and the removal of inappropriate, “disturbing” monuments. In this instance a politically incorrect monument has been (partially) destroyed by one of the many forest fires that, every year, hit central and southern Italy. This past summer was particularly dramatic, with more than 70,000 hectares of Italian forest destroyed by fires. However, this forest is not just any forest, but a prime example of the fascist appropriation of landscapes to mark a regime’s domination on both the country and its nature. The fact that this forest survived decades of neglect and a first attempt at getting rid of it in the 1950s has allowed it to become a powerful symbol for neo-fascist groups, who gather publicity by defending its historic value. So should we see the forest first and foremost as a forest, a natural landscape that perhaps should be restored, or as a disturbing memory of Mussolini? Ought we to recreate the forest, as a preservation of the memory of the country’s history? Or should we leave it to its destiny and forget about it? In 1998, the centre-left regional government allocated 260m liras (about €130,000) for the restoration of the forest. Although the aim was to promote the forest while writing over the text with the growth of new plants, it still ignited a heated debate, which even reached the national parliament, but ultimately ended without further consequences.  Then in 2004, the new regional government, led then by a far right politician, who had never hidden his sympathy for fascist ideology, started to restore the writing. For him this woody DUX seems to be quite an obsession; after the recent fire, he proposed a public collection of funds and the mobilisation of citizens in order to restore the forest. The region is now ruled again by a centre-left coalition, less committed to the conservation of this fossil of fascist forestry. This controversy feeds into a broader discussion in Italy over the conservation of fascist monuments and the public display of nazi-fascist symbols. This debate, which has been growing in Italy in the last few years, parallels the US debate on the removal of Confederate monuments. But there is something unique about the DUX forest. This is not a monument made of concrete and bricks, but memory inscribed into the landscape. The fire provides an opportunity to reflect on the natural and cultural legacies that are embodied in landscape, whether a vast burial field remembering the fallen of the war or even a national park set up in a border region to mark the state’s control over the area. Ghosts of the past are everywhere, not just in the more obvious human-made memorials. The stories with which they haunt the world are the lens through which we interpret the landscape. Recreating past symbols as they are is not just conservation, but rather an action with much symbolic and political value. So we are not sure whether there is any defensible reason to replant a hideous symbol of fascist rule, especially considering that foresters themselves are starting to reconsider whether reforestation is the right answer to fires.  Recent studies in forest ecology support the idea that replanting is not the best way to have an area recover from forest fires if the aim is to improve species variety: leaving the area to natural regrowth processes seems a better route to a sustainable and resilient forest. Plantations (such as the original DUX forest) are prone to burn again due to lower biodiversity. The variety of available plants, in particular the presence of more broadleaves, in fact would reduce the overall flammability.  Additionally, the area selected by fascist foresters for the DUX script was a calcareous, barren landscape, which may not be suited to supporting woodland in the long term anyway. Given all this, one wonders why the Italian public should fund the maintenance of the forest – especially in its fascist shape. Instead, the fire should be seen as an opportunity to explore other ways of critically preserving contested memories without being forced to maintain or even recreate odious monuments. An example of how something like this could be achieved by using augmented reality and social media is provided by the Digital Wonderland prototype app developed, in a completely different historical and social setting, for Yellowstone National Park. The idea would be to be able to superimpose, on the screen of your smartphone, historical elements and related contextual explanations on the landscape. Nature is made up of memories as much as of rocks, trees, and soil. We need to imagine a critical preservation of controversial memories, such as those haunting Mount Giano, one which does not reproduce oppression and hierarchies but frees the hidden stories of resistance and liberation.  Because of course, it was not tomato sauce that caused Mussolini’s own disappearance."
"Here we go. A nip in the air, the Christmas lights are up, Black Friday deals are still hanging around, and it is time once again for another international climate conference. The COP, or conference of the parties to give it its full name (the “parties” being the signatories to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) is the UN’s annual climate talks. This year it’s in Madrid, next year it’s Glasgow’s turn. They’ve been going since 1995 and although they are covered by journalists, they tend to run pretty inconspicuously.  But this time it feels that things might be different. That this is a special COP. Why not, when we’ve had the climate strikes, parliament calling a climate emergency and the advocacy of the inspirational Greta Thunberg? The world might finally be watching. Except, we’ve been here before. Wind back a decade to visit the ghost of climate politics past, when COP15 was in Copenhagen. This was promised to be a COP with a difference, set to update the 1997 Kyoto protocol (not least because the US had pulled out of it) and build global climate action fit for the 21st century. Climate change was, not unlike today, high on the list of public concerns. Campaign rhetoric was heavy with phrases such as “the time is now” and graphics of ticking clocks. There were new protest movements cropping up, warm words from politicians, as well as hand wringing over the ethics of flying, celeb-fronted concerts to raise awareness and even an Attenborough special on the BBC. We called it climate chaos back then, rather than a crisis, and it seemed ever so slightly further off still, even if we knew it was already biting. We didn’t have the boost of the youth strikers. Plus, as it was the late noughties, people were still buoyed by the Obama campaign (one PR push was even called “Hopenhagen”). For some reason, lots of people painted themselves blue. But in many ways, it was achingly similar to the past year. And then it crashed and burned. Eight draft texts and days of talks between 115 world leaders ended with Barack Obama and the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, brokering a loose accord which recognised the scientific case for keeping temperature rises to no more than 2C – but, crucially, didn’t contain commitments to cutting the emissions needed to get there. The climate movement retreated to lick its wounds. Things weren’t helped by the economic crash, which temporarily sapped energy from the cause. Climate activism, like most ongoing protest movements, relies on a steady flow of new blood but much of this was absorbed fighting austerity. The UN managed to pull things back with the 2015 Paris talks, carefully rebuilding momentum in the preceding years with talk of the “unstoppable” rise of clean energy. These talks even got people talking about the possibility of keeping global heating to 1.5C – perhaps its most important legacy being the commissioning of the IPCC’s 1.5 degrees report. Climate activism had been on the ascendancy before this was published in October last year, but it offered a powerful catalyst, scaring many into taking notice. To look now to the ghost of climate politics future, next year’s Glasgow’s talks are scheduled to be a bumper event; as big as the Copenhagen, Paris or Kyoto talks. They will involve a global stocktake of countries’ emissions reductions targets, and discussions over what action will need to be taken to stay anywhere below 2C warming. Will the energy we’ve seen globally over the last year and a half maintain itself until then? Public concern over climate change seems to bubble up every five to 10 years or so, with increasing levels of intensity, and has done since the 1950s. It’s vital that we keep this bubble going not just all the way until the Glasgow talks, but afterwards too. Climate politics is characterised by short bursts of activism heading towards short-term and often slightly arbitrary deadlines. We’ve been told again and again that the time is now, or at least within a few years, or the planet gets it. It’s understandable in some ways. Global climate action has been dragging its heels for so many decades that climate activists are tired of waiting. And, frankly, we’re scared of the consequences of further inaction. Yet the nature of the climate fight is that it’s one that will be with us for the long term, and so our activism has to be too. This is partly because we’ve left it so long that we have to deal with the warming we’ve already cooked up for ourselves as well as radical action to avoid more, but it’s also partly the nature of the beast. As climate scientist Kate Marvel neatly puts it, climate change isn’t a cliff you fall off at some particular stop on a thermometer or date in the calendar, it’s more a slope you slide down. As yet another decade of inaction on the climate crisis comes to an end and we look fresh-faced and hopeful to the next, we need to be ready to look far ahead. The climate movement as a whole must build sustained, long-term relationships with the public rather than bubbles of activity, so that politicians can’t let it drop off their radar. We also need to build resilience, including care of one another, and have strategies for long-term sustained action. At the Paris talks, for example, some NGOs split teams between people who worked on the summit (who could then fall asleep in a heap at the close) and those ready to clean up after. This is the sort of approach that will keep us going. We don’t have time to wait for the phoenix of climate action to burn out and rise again – 2020 has to be the year we don’t just battle the climate crisis but ensure it’s a fight we stick with. • Alice Bell is co-director at climate change charity, Possible, and is writing a book on the history of the climate crisis."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGeologist Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt have been busy mapping the Medieval Warm Period using Google as a tool.
Lately their focus has been on a number of studies examining temperature reconstructions from the Baffin Island and Western Greenland. This focus has been in part in response to a recent paper by Nicolás Young, a glacial geologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, which claimed with “great clarity of evidence” that the Medieval Warm Period did not exist globally and that it was a “patchy” phenomenon at best.
First Lüning finds that the paper’s emotional tone peculiar – one that seemed to be fishing for media attention at any price. Lüning notes, “One has to wonder that Columbia University would allow such an emotional and combative press release to go through.” Lüning and Vahrenholt added: “The paper also failed to get any attention from the German press. Did they sense that something could be rotten about it?”
Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s spent three weeks examining Young’s paper and many others from the region. Their conclusion: Young’s paper is ripe for the dustbin.
In all the two German scientists looked at more than two dozen papers from the region inquestion, covering some 20 locations, see plot below:

Figure 1: Chart of studies with results of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). The numbers refer to the sequence of the discussion in the text. Red points indicate MWP was warm, blue points show it was cold. See the interactive Google Maps map here.
Because time is short, I’ve translated only the summaries. All the abstracts of the more than 2 dozen papers presented are in English at Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s post, which I’ve linked to above.
Summary of results for Canada
In the North Canadian Arctic, the situation certainly appears to be clear: The MWP is described in numerous studies. Only 2 of 16 glacier studies (among them the one from (Young et al. 2015) show MWP glacier advances, which likely was a local phenomenon, e.g. caused by heavy local snowfall.
Lüning and Vahrenholt also looked at studies examining western Greenland, see following chart:

Figure 2: Chart of studies with results of the Medieval Warm Period (MWP) – Close-up of Greenland’s west coast. The red markers indicate a warm MWP, the blue ones indicate it was cold. See the interactive Google Maps here.
In Western Greenland all studies show that the Medieval Warm Period was in fact warm. Moreover not only does Lüning’s and Vahrenholt’s comprehensive Google Maps-based survey show that the Medieval Warm Period was real in the Arctic, but that it was clearly a global phenomenon as well.
Lüning and Vahrenholt summarize:
The detailed analysis of all the literature concerning the MWP in the Northeast Canadian Arctic as well as western Greenland shows that the claims made Young et al. 2015 are untenable. The MWP in the region is well-documented. Suddenly all these studies are supposed to be wrong? Young and his colleagues obviously failed to put the other local studies in the necessary regional context. Because of the failure to do so, they arrived at misleading and faulty conclusions, which they actively promoted to the broad public in a provocative and scientifically unbalanced press release. It remains unclear as to why the peer-reviewers of the journal Science Advances did not detect these deficiencies and did not request corrections. Will the many authors of the papers presented here discuss the results with Young et al. in order to resolve the deviating results, or do they risk being publicly ostracized as climate skeptical lobbyists? The scientific climate discussion is in a political choke hold. The Young et al. paper and its inappropriate alarmist marketing (“coup de grâce for the MWP”) is an example of the questionable and emotionally-charged condition of today’s climate research.”

Share this...FacebookTwitterIn Paris countries signed a (non-binding) agreement on climate, and now coal will soon disappear from our lives, right? Think again.
A new paper by Japanese scientist Kyoji Kimoto published by Energy and Environment here suggests CO2 climate forcing has been grandly overstated, and as a consequence coal will remain an energy backbone for many nations in the future.
Kimoto maintains there’s been confusion over the Planck feedback parameters.
Here’s the abstract, emphasis added:
The central dogma is critically evaluated in the anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory of the IPCC, claiming the Planck response is 1.2K when CO2 is doubled. The first basis of it is one dimensional model studies with the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5°K/km. It is failed from the lack of the parameter sensitivity analysis of the lapse rate for CO2 doubling. The second basis is the Planck response calculation by Cess in 1976 having a mathematical error. Therefore, the AGW theory is collapsed along with the canonical climate sensitivity of 3°K utilizing the radiative forcing of 3.7W/m2 for CO2 doubling. The surface climate sensitivity is 0.14-0.17K in this study with the surface radiative forcing of 1.1W/m2. Since the CO2 issue is removed, coal will be the energy for the future of many nations in terms of the amount of resource and production cost.”
“Basic errors” in the AGW theory
In an e-mail Kimoto wrote he has 5 years experience in the computer simulation of chemical processes and has read most of the leading papers of the AGW scientists and found basic mathematical errors in the theory. His paper suggests that coal’s effect on climate has been considerably exaggerated, and that it will remain an essential energy source for many countries long into the future – due to its economy, availability and reliability.
In the paper’s conclusion, Kimoto states:
The central dogma of the IPCC is theoretically failed that the zero feedback climate sensitivity (Planck response) is 1.2K for 2xCO2, resulting in the collapse of the AGW theory claiming the canonical climate sensitivity of 3K for CO2 doubling.”

"From the use of seaweed for bleaching linen, to Roman emperors eating oysters as aphrodisiacs, human culture along the North Atlantic coast has been integrally linked to the exploitation of the sea for centuries. But as populations have expanded and economies grown, people have impoverished the ocean.  The history of Atlantic Ocean exploitation is in no small part due to its immense productivity. Legend has it that stocks of Atlantic cod were once so plentiful that fishermen proclaimed they could walk across the ocean on the backs of fish.  By 1913, 1.2m tonnes of fish were being landed in the UK alone. At the same time 700m European flat oysters were being consumed annually in just London. Since then, landings have been in steady decline. Catch is now at around 0.4m tonnes and the number of employed fishermen has fallen from 50,000 in 1938 to 12,000 in 2015.  The Atlantic Ocean of 2017 is a shadow of its former self. The once productive fishery resources were supported by rich, biodiverse and expansive habitats such seagrass meadows and kelp forests, but study after study has shown that these habitats have been destroyed and degraded by poor water quality, destructive fishing practices and coastal developments. Now the Atlantic is facing fresh challenges, this time from the growth of marine renewable energy infrastructure. But there is a potential solution: ocean rewilding.  Ocean rewilding is “the large-scale restoration of ecosystems where nature can take care of itself”. The concept encourages a balance between people and the rest of nature where each can thrive.  Terrestrial restoration of ecosystems such as woodlands, rivers and marsh lands are commonplace. And commercial companies are even providing “off the shelf” solutions for some of this. The reintroductions of species such as the beaver, wolves and ospreys have been a success, but to date comparable rewilding of our oceans has only been minimal. With the major loss of seagrass and oyster well documented, there is now growing interest and opportunities for this kind of restoration to occur underwater too.  Researchers across the globe have pioneered the restoration of the marine environment, and our knowledge of this is growing. Large scale restoration successes in places such as Chesapeake Bay – an estuary off the coast of Virginia, US – using seed dispersal have transformed the marine environment. Restored seagrass meadows have been proven to provide important fisheries habitat, and at the same time are beginning to sequester large amounts of CO₂ from the atmosphere. Many Atlantic cod stocks are now exploited at more sustainable levels, and regulation across Europe is resulting in cleaner coastal waters. This is leading to the belief that major steps can be made to reverse degradation that has taken place in this ocean too.  Our team has been underwater gardening to help improve methods for marine habitat restoration. This underwater rewilding work commenced in 2014 with initial laboratory trials but has now expanded into the sea. It’s not just about planting pretty flowers, or creative rockeries, like one might do outside their home, these projects are attempting to utilise the opportunities of offshore and coastal renewable energy. Tidal lagoons, for example, are being proposed around the world as a potential option for reliable and predictable power generation. But these large sheltered lagoons can also be a major opportunity for environmental renewal.  We have been working with a company, Tidal Lagoon Power, to examine methods for creating new seagrass habitats in these lagoons. This includes growing seedlings in labs and planting them, deploying lines of seed bags, and transplanting plants from donor sites. Just like terrestrial gardening this is done using trowels and all the paraphernalia from a garden shed – albeit underwater. And working with partners in the Netherlands we’ve been taking part in a major test to utilise biodegradable bio-plastics to help support these transplanted seagrass. The use of these biodegradable materials is vital given the vast problems of plastics in our oceans and the risk of inadvertently polluting the ocean with parts of our experiments. With further research we hope to take trials of underwater gardening in tidal lagoons and turn them into actual habitat creation and ultimately bolster the rewilding of our oceans. As marine renewable energy options grow and develop, these need to be seen not in terms of the conflict with the productivity of our oceans but as an opportunity to enhance it."

Share this...FacebookTwitterReader Kenneth Richards has been very busy.
Not long ago he supplied a list of 250 papers published in 2015 casting doubt on the consensus climate science, read here. Many of them confirm that natural factors are the main drivers of climate change.
Shortly after that he supplied a list of 50 similar papers appearing just in the first two months of this year alone. See here.
248 papers in 2014
Today he provides a compilation of 248 papers from 2014 that casts huge doubt on the allegedly “consensus-backed” climate science. In total we have now seen over 500 papers over the past 2 years contesting much of what the UN IPCC has been preaching.
Moreover Kenneth Richards writes in an e-mail that he has found another 12 papers to add to the 2015 list of 250 we mentioned earlier, bringing that total to about 260. He informs me that he is going to take the time to compile a list for 2013.
70 papers already this year alone
Finally he notes that the list for 2016 has already reached 70 in number.

Perhaps someone needs to send these long lists of peer-reviewed scientific publications to Prof. Naomi Oreskes, an activist historian who has somehow managed to convince herself that the science is settled and over. Nothing could be further from the truth. Her e-mail address: oreskes@fas.harvard.edu.
Readers are of course welcome to send these lists to elected officials so that they may become aware that climate science is not settled, that natural factors are in fact dominating, and that dire IPCC projections of warming and ice melt are profoundly exaggerated. It is your democratic right and duty to do so.

"The world is witnessing an increase in the number and severity of hurricanes, droughts, floods and famines. A significant part of this is attributable to the temperature rises and disruption to the weather systems that human industrial activity has triggered.  Yet at this very moment, when the world needs new protections to mitigate dangerous climate change more than ever, Britain faces a struggle to maintain its current levels of environmental protection. Britain’s vote to leave the European Union has set in place a process that, if it continues, jeopardises the future of many of the country’s most important environmental protections. In a recent briefing to MPs, my colleague Tim O'Riordan and I focused on the threat to what’s called the precautionary principle, and why it matters for the future of environmental law after Brexit.   The precautionary principle is present in UK law mainly by way of its presence in EU law. It says that if the potential downside of some action or technology is huge, then the normal burden of proof should be reversed. In other words, rather than scientists having to prove that something is dangerous before it’s regulated or prohibited, those wishing to do the potentially dangerous thing should have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it is safe before they are allowed to do it. Better safe than sorry. The draft EU Withdrawal Bill currently making its way through parliament would eliminate the precautionary principle from environmental law, thus confirming many of the environmental movement’s worst fears about what Brexit could mean for sustainability.  An amendment vote on November 15 went against the principle being retained in British law. There will probably be another chance before the end of November to vote the precautionary principle into post-Brexit law when MPs vote on another proposed change to the bill, amendment NC28.  But this is not likely to pass either, because the environment secretary, Michael Gove, has played a clever hand in appeasing those Conservatives keen on environmental protection in such a way that he can make the case that the precautionary principle will not be eliminated. The fact remains that Gove’s proposed way of “preserving” it – by creating a new environmental watchdog and a new policy statement on environmental principles – would mean that it would no longer be part of UK law. This principle is part of what keeps us safe: in Britain, in Europe, and globally. If the principle were eliminated, it could put at risk current protections for natural habitats, and protections against reckless introduction of new technologies and potentially dangerous pesticides. For example, the European Union’s ban on beef reared with growth hormones is partly based on the application of the precautionary principle. Perhaps most worrying is the possibility that one of the lynchpins of European Union environmental law may be downgraded or abandoned by Britain without real public scrutiny in order to make the country more “competitive” for markets and attractive to overseas trade deals. This is especially the case with potential deals with the US, which does not accept the precautionary principle as being a basis for law. In international law, the precautionary principle’s most widespread accepted form is that found in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, which mandates that:  Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation. At its heart, precaution represents a challenge to purely “evidence-based” risk-management practices. Instead, the precautionary principle points out that when full evidence is lacking we should err on the side of caution and regulate potential threats, if those could cause serious or irreversible damage. This is more important than ever as we create new synthetic products, including even synthetic life, and as we meddle, at our existential risk, with our climate. The precautionary principle tends to be out of favour with those who are focused on promoting growth, trade and investment at all costs. Consequently, it was of no surprise that Greenpeace’s 2015 leaks of the UK-US trade negotiations over the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership trade deal revealed that the US – even under Obama’s presidency – was keen to push for its abandonment as part of that deal.  If we believe that risks should be borne by those who take them and not by the public, then we must defend and indeed extend the scope of the precautionary principle. While Brexit undoubtedly challenges us to maintain our environmental protections, it could also be an opportunity to expand them. Leaving the EU need not mean the abandonment of key environmental protections, providing that there is a will and knowledge within the general population and political representatives about the importance of these protections.  If the precautionary principle is to survive the current political and legal process in Britain, it needs wider understanding and wider support. The government needs to understand that ordinary citizens understand what is at stake here, and care. It’s now up to UK citizens to ensure that this matter reverberates up to local MPs, to the top tiers of all parties’ leadership teams, and beyond. This will not be an easy task, but, either for ill or for good, the consequences are potentially huge for ourselves, our environment, and our descendants."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMeteorologist Paul Dorian at Vencoreweather.com here has a post on the latest concerning El Nino and global sea ice. Not long ago the warmists and alarmists were jumping and hollering about the drop in Arctic sea ice, accompanied by talk (hope) of an ice-free Arctic.
Arctic sea ice rebounds
Looks like all the talk was premature hysteria, as Arctic sea ice has moved back into a normal range. So rapidly can things up there change. It goes to show that natural factors do rule, and that a few tenths of a degree of global warming is nothing but a circus show. Vencoreweather writes:
Concerning the El Nino, ‘it has begun to collapse and will likely flip to a moderate or strong La Nina (colder-than-normal water) by later this year. In rather quick fashion, global temperatures have seemingly responded to the unfolding collapse of El Nino and global sea ice has actually rebounded in recent weeks to near normal levels.”
He adds: “…in recent weeks global sea ice has surged back to near normal as the collapse of El Nino has unfolded.”
Global surface temperatures fall as La Nino wanes
Of course sea ice does not react directly to ENSO changes, and certainly the recent sea ice surge had much more to do with local polar weather conditions. On the other hand, global temperature is in part modulated by the ENSO as the following chart indicates:

The chart above shows that global temperatures have eased back from their high earlier this year.

Arctic ice volume trending sharply upwards over past 5 years
Vencoreweather also presents a chart showing that Arctic sea ice volume trend has remained flat over the past decade, and it has actually been recovering over the past 5 years. All the talk of a death spiral are misplaced, to put it nicely.

Dorian writes that the University of Washington’s Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) “is showing an upward trend in Arctic sea ice volume since the low point was reached in 2012 following a long downtrend (circled area above)“.
Also Dorian points out that Antarctic sea ice has rebounded and is now above the mean. Overall Antarctic sea ice has been trending upwards since satellite measurements began.
Robust La Nina now in the works
Today Joe Bastardi posted at FaceBook a new chart issued by NOAA, writing: “CFSV2 continues to correct toward SCRIPPS with newest members (blue) now going to strong La Nina territory.

This latest “correction is rather amusing as just weeks ago NOAA predicted that there would not even be a La Nina. perhaps the NOAA allowed itself to become engulfed by all the warming hysteria, before having to scramble to avoid total forecast humiliation.

"The Great Storm that struck south-east England and northern France in October  1987 left at least 22 people dead. What made the storm so exceptionally damaging – and, as a meteorologist, so exceptionally interesting – is that it was accompanied by a phenomenon we now know as a sting jet. Mid-latitude cyclones like the Great Storm and most other major storms that hit the UK tend to extend over several hundred kilometres, and they can generate strong surface winds over a wide area. The sting jet, on the other hand, is a narrow current of air within some such cyclones which accelerates as it descends into the lower atmosphere. There it produces potentially the most severe wind damage over a swath usually less than 100 kilometres across.  Fifteen years ago the existence of sting jets was unknown. But since then various scientists, including myself, have studied them and we are beginning to understand them better. This work is important as it is still quite a challenge to factor such small-scale features into weather forecasts, however lethal their effects may be. One could be forgiven for believing that weather science was sufficiently mature that most significant phenomena would already have been identified. So it was exciting to find this new feature, which wasn’t just a more severe version of the things we knew about but, rather, was different in kind and not just in degree. The first step of course was to identify that such a phenomenon exists: this came about as a result of an especially detailed analysis of the October 1987 storm which was published in 2004.  Important clues pointing to the existence of the new phenomenon were provided by satellite cloud imagery. The strongest winds were seen to emerge at the tip of a hook of cloud curving around the cyclone centre, much like a scorpion’s sting is found at the end of its curved tail. We therefore named it a “sting jet”. The wind speed in the sting jet far exceeded the rate of advance of the cloud tip. This indicated that the dry air in the red area could only have come from within this cloud. The cloud was in fact evaporating because of the warming caused by the descent of the sting jet. The amount of warming was, however, mitigated by virtue of some cooling due to evaporation. This cooling was thought to play a role in bringing the sting jet winds down to the surface. Another characteristic of the cloud in this region was that it was found to be composed of a series of cloud fingers. This kind of structure is consistent with a particular form of rather small-scale instability. It is the resulting small-scale sloping layers of ascending and descending air that give rise to the observed fingers of cloud. These findings triggered a number of studies that confirmed that sting jets do descend as they accelerate and that the suspected small-scale dynamical instability does indeed exist, not only as it probably did in the October 87 storm but also in other damaging windstorms that have been investigated since. Other researchers found that flows resembling sting jets could be created by air descending into a region of stronger pressure gradient as it travels around the cyclone centre. The resulting dynamical forces occur on a larger scale – and hence are better known. These researchers suggest that sting jets might thus be generated without needing either evaporative cooling or the smaller-scale dynamical instability.  Weather forecasts have improved a great deal over the past three decades and if the October 87 storm were to be repeated, there would be useful warnings a few days in advance. The real challenge now is to predict whether there will be a small core of extreme winds due to a sting jet and just where and when it will occur. It is doubtful that the large-scale forces alone can be adequate to reliably predict the intensity and location of the most damaging winds associated with a sting jet.  An emerging view is that the greatest damage occurs in a sting jet due to a combination of all of the factors above: the large-scale forces set the scene and the smaller-scale processes account for the focused nature of the area of greatest damage. This means that weather forecast models need to have very high resolution in order to properly resolve the small-scale processes. Also, if cooling by evaporation is confirmed to be important, there will need to be improvements in the way in which clouds are represented in these models. The representation of cloud processes is a key challenge not only in weather forecast models but in climate models too."

Share this...FacebookTwitterGerman Bavarian Broadcasting, Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), has a report on wind energy in the southeastern state that is famous for its Oktoberfest, dirndls and lederhosen. It appears the brakes have been effectively applied to the scenery pollution industry.

Eyesores no longer welcome in Germany. Photo: wind park in Lower Saxony, for illustration only, Philip May, CC BY-SA 3.0.
Bavaria is also home to some of the country’s most idyllic landscapes. But unfortunately Germany’s “Greens” have been pushing hard to industrialize this precious natural treasure – all with the aim of saving the planet. They have proposed the construction of dozens of wind parks of 200-meter tall turbines across the country side.
In the early days wind turbines were viewed as sort of a novelty and many communities even lobbied to get them. However, as wind parks sprouted across the country, people woke up to the natural destruction and overall inefficiency the wind energy has wreaked. Today, the BR report tells us that the tipping point has been reached: wind parks are no longer welcome; They’re too ugly, noisy, inefficient and only a very few profit from them at the expense of the many.
The BR report features one Bavarian village, Obbach, where a wind park with five 200-meter tall turbines was installed just 800 hundred meters away. Unfortunately for the village the park had been approved before Germany’s 10-H rule was enacted, and so construction went ahead much to the dissatisfaction of the village residents. The 10-H rule stipulates that no turbine may be closer to a living area than 10 times its height. Had the rule been enacted sooner, it would not have been possible to put up the park and the Obbach’s residents would have been spared the eyesore and noise.

Resident Andrea Lettowsky tells BR:
For me I keep thinking about how this used to be a beautiful landscape with open fields, and now it’s an industrial zone.”
That’s pretty much the sentiment that has spread across Germany, and with the 10-H rule Bavaria is leading the way in the country’s growing resistance to landscape spoilage by inefficient wind power. Already over 300 citizens initiatives have formed to resist the construction of new parks across the country. Moreover, recent reports tell us the German government is poised to scale back on renewable energies, aiming to cap it at 40 – 45% of total energy supply by 2025, according to the Berliner Zeitung.
The BR reports that although it is too late for Obbach, the new 10H rule is welcome and now gives communities the power to stop wind park projects that are aggressively pushed by deep-pocketed outside investors. Though it’s regrettable the park could not be stopped, Lettowsky is optimistic that other projects will be stopped elsewhere. The BR report concludes:
The fact is that the 10-H rule and the resistance from the citizens have pretty much put the brakes on further wind park construction in Bavaria.”
Indeed, thanks to forward looking states like Bavaria, the renewable energy tide is changing for the better.

"The crowd that gathered outside Hungary’s neo-gothic parliament building on Friday was loud, young and passionate. The latest round of global school climate strikes drew several thousand people in Budapest, including the city’s newly elected liberal mayor. They sang, chanted and shouted demands to the country’s politicians to take the climate emergency seriously. But there was little sign that inside parliament, dominated by the Fidesz party of the far-right prime minister, Viktor Orbán, the politicians were listening. It was an illustration of a key new political divide in Europe, between rightwing forces who preach that the greatest danger to life as we know it is migration, and those who say instead that the biggest threat comes from the climate emergency. One of the clearest examples of this is in Germany, which has seen parallel increases in popularity for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and the Greens. In the eastern half of Europe, where traditionally green politics has found little support, there are signs of a similar divide appearing. Here, too, the climate emergency is filtering into the public consciousness, particularly though not exclusively among younger people in the cities. In October, Gergely Karácsony, an opposition politician who stood on a platform that prominently featured green issues, won a surprise victory in Budapest’s mayoral election against Orbán’s preferred candidate. His team believes that the climate issue has the potential to galvanise opposition to the government. “Due to the rise of Greta [Thunberg, the Swedish teenage activist] and the whole movement it has entered a lot of people’s consciousness in the past year, and I see a lot of people who weren’t involved in any activism before starting to get involved,” said Dávid Dorosz, the deputy mayor in the new administration, speaking on the sidelines of Friday’s protest which he attended together with Karácsony. There are several policy plans that will help make Budapest a greener city, he said, but to what extent they can be implemented will depend on funding from Orbán’s central government. Orbán has shied away from pure denial of climate science, but has on repeated occasions suggested the green movement is being used as a cover for liberal, globalist designs. “Aside from a few dozen activists, the whole topic interests no one, which only shows the sanity of Hungarian society,” his chief of staff, Gergely Gulyás, said in September. He also called Thunberg “a sick child”. Benedek Jávor, a Hungarian green politician and former MEP, said the climate scepticism was born out of political rather than ideological reasons. “Orbán has decided to position Fidesz on the populist extreme right and to oppose those new challenges to the political structure posed by the climate movement and Greens,” he said. At a European council summit in June, Hungary was among four countries that blocked an EU-wide plan for net zero-carbon emissions by 2050: the others were Poland, the Czech Republic and Estonia. All have rightwing, populist governments with the exception of Estonia, but there, too, the governing coalition includes a far-right party. Estonia has said in the interim that it is ready to back the target, but the other three holdouts look unlikely to budge. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, asked at the June summit: “Why should we decide 31 years ahead of time what will happen in 2050?” Last week, the European parliament declared a global “climate and environmental emergency”, but activists have said the words will be meaningless if they are not backed up with tougher action. At a summit next week, the European council may try again to agree the 2050 target. In September, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, singled out Poland for blocking attempts to enshrine the carbon neutrality goal. “Marching every Friday to say that the planet is burning, that’s nice, but that is not the problem. Go protest in Poland! Help me move those I cannot push forward,” he said. Poland has said its reliance on coal means it will need to be compensated more from the central EU budget before it can commit to carbon neutrality. In Hungary, the government says its opposition to the target is also based on purely financial considerations. Orbán’s spokesman, Zoltán Kovács, said: “There’s no need to rush. We have an accepted strategy to 2030, if you want to change that you have to reconfigure the set of available data. Who is going to pay for the cost?” Kovács said Hungary had made it clear that it supported the EU’s broad climate goals and said the prime minister was in no way a climate sceptic. However, the parliament speaker, László Kövér, said in September that those who believed the climate emergency was a bigger danger than migration had been “brainwashed by the media”. A recent scandal over a consultation linked to the 2050 goals is illustrative. Over the past few years, Orbán’s government has spent millions of pounds sending out questionnaires to the population featuring leading questions on issues such as migration, EU interference and the supposed nefarious influence of the financier and philanthropist George Soros. But a survey on climate change last month was given different treatment: buried in a Google document posted in obscure corners of government websites. When opposition parties happened upon the survey and began publicising it, responses started pouring in, with a reported 200,000 Hungarians filling out the form. It was a sign both of the government’s lack of interest and the potential for popular mobilisation around climate issues. Dorosz says he thinks Orbán believes climate activism to be “a kind of hoax and a leftist conspiracy”, but that the prime minister is right to be wary of the issue. “There is a new wave of people who are realising that we’re running out of time. For the opposition, this will be one of the main pillars of our common platform, and part of our core identity.” Additional reporting by Christian Davies in Warsaw and Robert Tait in Prague"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe online Vermont news site Vermont Digger here presents a commentary by Vermont state Senator John Rodgers who represents my childhood home county of Orleans, and Essex county as well.
Photo: Industrializing Vermont’s idyllic landscape. Cropped from video by Green Mountain Power Corp.
Senator Rodgers has had it with industrial wind energy ruining his state’s environment, announcing:
I will join with the growing number of Vermonters who have concluded that industrial wind turbines do not belong in Vermont, period.”
As a consequence, in 2016 Rodgers plans to introduce a bill that would ban industrial wind turbines, sending them the way of the billboard. Rodgers position illustrates the rapidly growing resistance to industrial wind parks erected on Vermont’s idyllic Green Mountains.
“Devastating” impact
Recently nearby wind-parks in Sheffield and Lowell have driven the message home to local residents and tourists that the green energies aren’t green at all and that they are coming with a unexpectedly high environmental price. Rodgers, in his piece, calls the environmental impacts of wind turbines “devastating”.
Corrupt legislators, campaign finances for environmental ruin
Moreover Rodgers, a Democrat no less, accuses the Vermont legislature of political corruption:

We have legislators who write policy to serve the very utilities and energy developers that finance their campaigns.”
He also blasts industrial solar fields in Vermont, another state where the sun doesn’t shine at night and one which often sees snow 6 months a year. He supports restrictions on large-scale solar installations, which he says benefits no one except solar industry profiteers. He writes that covering farmland and forests with solar panels reduces the amount of land available to grow food.
No affect on climate
The Vermont state senator writes that even the Public Service Department acknowledges that Vermont green energy policies will have no affect climate change, yet that they severely damage the local environment. He calls on protecting the state’s forests and not industrializing them.
Vermont’s power is already carbon neutral – why ruin the landscape for nothing?
It should be noted that some 150 years ago Vermont was mostly deforested due to its early sheep farming.
Moreover some 90% of the state’s electric power has come from carbon neutral sources already!, such as Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant and hydroelectric power from Quebec. Vermont has far fewer than a million inhabitants and there is no sense whatsoever in ruining its landscape for something that will have absolutely zero impact whatsoever on the climate. It all boils down to green ideological showboating – one that comes with a terrible environmental heritage price.
Hopefully, more political leaders will follow Rodgers’s lead and think seriously about what they are wreaking upon the state’s beauty. As it stands, too many politicians have been governing under the influence of “green” dope and climate science BS. Unfortunately it looks like it’s going to take a massive environmental hangover before they sober up from all the climate insanity.

Share this...FacebookTwitterYesterday I wrote about how wind park planners and the city councilmen who recklessly approve them may be held personally liable for damage to health that they cause, primarily through infrasound.  With locals wind parks, too often crony deals are involved and legitimate opposition gets brushed aside or squashed. The result is often a select few end up lining their pockets while the rest are left to suffer.
A few days ago the German language NWZ mobil here reported on a heated wind park controversy that is boiling over in northwest Germany, writing that “state attorneys are now opening investigations on the profiteers of big money wind energy and how planned wind parks are dividing communities“.
The NWZ mobil writes:
Wind energy makes some rich, the others sick, as tensions peak at the North Sea coast.”
The controversy swirls around opposition to a planned wind park expansion near the home of Wolfgang Mänzel in the village Stedesdorf.
NWZ mobil reports Mänzel at first was enthusiastic about wind parks near in his community, and even invested in the nearby “Citizens’ Wind Park Stedesdorf” nearby, with the hopes of reaping returns. But all that has since changed.
The returns on the investment have been disappointing and investors such as Mänzel have since realized that the business opportunity was never meant to make them rich at all, but rather was set up “to help raise the acceptance for wind energy out in the countryside by using financial incentives,” The NWZ mobil writes. In reality the terms of the investment scheme were all along designed to make a select group of planners and councilmen rich, but not the small investors.
Its no surprise that in Stedesdorf those really profiting the most are now trying to expand the wind park by another 5 turbines. But Wolfgang Mänzel and others feel they were misled by some of the councilmen. It turns out three of the them have a direct stake in the expansion project and stand to profit even more handsomely.  Now there are growing accusations of corruption and the town stands bitterly divided amid a thickening atmosphere of distrust and deep suspicion.

The NWZ mobil writes that wind energy critics and opponents now live in an atmospheres of threats and hostility. The NWZ mobil reports:
Wind energy is a multi-million euro business: high state subsidies, guaranteed for years, paid for by the power consumers.
Wind energy is in part a criminal business. Not only local politicians are profiting. The mafia launders money by investing in wind parks.”
To protest the seemingly self-serving projects, in October 2015 Mänzel and others founded a citizens initiative against the wind park expansion, and published an open letter to make the affair more public. The recent accusations of corruption have since led to authorities launching an investigation of the “Stedesdorf Wind Park”.
The NWZ reports:
At the state prosecutor’s office in Osnabruck, two anonymous reports of wrongdoing have been filed at the end of January against five partners. Now the state attorney’s office in Celle is investigating for possible bribes to parliamentarians.”
Welcome to the real world of German “green energy”.
In the meantime there has been some good news. NDR television here reports that the additional 5 turbines that had been planned to be added have been overwhelmingly rejected by local citizens, with 80% voting against them – though the vote is non-binding.

The largest mass of our solar system (99.8% of the total mass) was also rather quiet in January. The determined solar sunspot number (SSN) was 56.6, which is 71% of the mean this far into the period, calculated using the 23 previously measured solar cycles.

Figure 1: Plot of the monthly sunspot number so far for the current cycle (red line) compared to the mean solar cycle (blue line) and the similar solar cycle no. 5 (black).
The earlier peak occurring at month number 35 (fall 2011) signaled the time of the SSN maximum at the sun’s northern hemisphere. The later peaks occurring at about month no. 68 (mid 2014) are the SSN maximum for the sun’s southern hemisphere. What follows is a plot of all cycles, showing the accumulated number of sunspots over the first 86 months into the cycle:

Figure 2: Comparison of sunspot activity for every cycle occurring since 1755. the values represent the deviation from the mean SSN (blue curve in Figure 1).
There are about 3 more years to go before the end of solar cycle no. 24 is reached. When it is finished we will very likely see the red bar representing solar cycle no. 24 in Figure 2 winding up well below that of solar cycle no. 7, which was the last occurring during the Dalton Minimum. That cycle had much more activity in the end phase than what we are seeing in the current cycle.
Prognoses here, however, are fraught with huge uncertainty, as “solar weather” defies all forecasting attempts and no one can say with any certainty what can be expected to happen over the next two years – except for over the long run, the current cycle will end in a rather quiet fashion.
========================
Note from NoTricksZone:
The combination of recent North Atlantic cooling, the projected coming La Niña, and the expected period of low solar activity may see the planet cooling over the next 10 years as fast as it warmed during a few short years in the 1990s. Joe Bastardi’s “Triple Whammy of Cooling” truly is taking shape.

"The third episode of the BBC’s Blue Planet II spectacularly described a series of fascinating interactions between species on some of the most pristine reefs in the world. These reefs, analogous to bustling cities, are powered by sunlight, and provide space and services for a wealth of marine life.   Competition is rife, as exemplified by the ferocious jaws of the metre-long bobbit worm, ready to pounce on unsuspecting fish by night from its lair in the sand, or the pulsating show of colours of the cuttlefish as it stalks a mesmerised crab. Other reef species team up in unlikely partnerships to improve the outcome of a hunt for fish amongst the coral, as shown by the pointing display of an octopus working in cahoots with a grouper. Inevitably, the episode described how these cities are under threat, as warming oceans destroy the symbiotic relationship between the corals and the algae living within them, causing the corals to lose their algae, and become bleached.  Prolonged bleaching leads to the death of the colonies that build the reef, leaving behind lifeless ruins. Since 2014, an unprecedented series of consecutive warming events driven by climate change, have affected many reefs, including the Australian Great Barrier Reef, and annual bleaching is predicted to become more frequent, leaving no time for the reefs to recover between these extreme events.  In the last scenes, narrator David Attenborough provides a glimmer of hope as he describes corals and other reef species spawning on mass to produce new generations of life to build new reefs. The producers understandably visit the best and most pristine reefs in the world to capture these wonderful sequences. We must remember that the majority of coral reefs, especially those close to large human populations, are already degraded due to localised impact from over and destructive fishing, nutrient run off from urban and agricultural land, and coastal development. The most severely threatened reefs are in South-East Asia and the Atlantic, but even the Indian Ocean, Middle East and wider Pacific are now suffering from direct human impact. Estimates indicate that 75% of the world’s reefs are already threatened by local threats combined with rising sea surface temperatures and mortality from coral bleaching.  Even the remote reefs of the central Indian Ocean and north-west Pacific are now weakened, and vulnerable to disease. Assuming current trajectories, by mid-century bleaching episodes are predicted to be annual events affecting most reefs, and by the end of the century, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels will have changed ocean chemistry causing acidification, weakening the calcium carbonate skeletons of corals and slowing their growth . In their weakened state, these corals reefs will be further compromised by more frequent tropical storms and rising sea levels. Resilient reefs may have some ability to resist climate change and adapt to the changing conditions or recover from these disturbances. Corals in the Gulf experience high seasonal temperatures of up to 35°C without bleaching, having adapted to these conditions over evolutionary time, although sustained high temperatures, such as those as experienced in 2010, can still cause them to bleach .  Some corals grow in near shore murky waters, where they may receive protection from high solar irradiation; even cloudy conditions can protect corals during warming events. Strong water currents and upwelling may also mitigate bleaching on seaward reefs.  Calm conditions, on the other hand, appear to enhance bleaching susceptibility. The remote and protected reefs of the Chagos Archipelago in the central Indian Ocean experienced 90% mortality in shallow waters in the severe warming event of 1998. They displayed a relatively rapid recovery over 12 years compared to many other reefs  with rapid growth of branching and tabular corals. But consecutive warming events in 2015, 2016 and 2017 have devastated the shallow (less than 15 metres deep) reefs of these uninhabited and isolated reefs once more, and recovery may be more challenging this time.   Coral recruits can already be observed, probably from slightly deeper depths, but they are settling on dead collapsing colonies and will be washed off the reefs in storms. Successful recolonisation may depend on the availability of stable substrates and being able to compete with the algae that is replacing the live coral. Although global action is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (and this will have little effect until mid-century), management intervention at a local level can build resilience on reefs by reducing direct human impact. In a study in Belize, localised fishing was controlled in a Marine Reserve in which grazing of algae by parrotfish was maintained, halving the rate of reef decline.    By maintaining the organisation and complexity of reefs, we can ensure that these reef cities thrive, even in the most threatened regions.  At the end of the Blue Planet II reef episode, thousands of groupers gathered at the drop off on a pristine and remote reef in French Polynesia, risking gatherings of hundreds of sharks to swim out into the tidal stream to spawn.  Off the Cayman Islands, in the central Caribbean, similar groups of spawning Nassau grouper were once heavily exploited by local fishers but are now legally protected. Acoustic techniques have been used to show that they are now once more gathering in their thousands to spawn. As Blue Planet II made clear, our planet’s reefs are both beautiful and in peril. We do, however, still have time to save them – but only if we act now."

A photo published at the online www.shz.de/lokal vividly illustrates how the green energy movement has nothing to do with protecting the environment and restoring nature to how it was before industrialization began some 200 years ago. Ironically it is profoundly blighting it.
The photo in a commentary by Gernot Kühl shows a landscape near the north German town of Dagebüll (close to Eckernförde) which has been literally obliterated by industrial wind turbines which, according to the report, has made the place “uninhabitable”. Photographer and artist Heinz Teufel comments:
The pictured landscape has officially been declared no longer inhabitable.”
Moreover Kühl writes:
Anyone travelling the vast land behind the dikes and anyone searching for the endless horizon of the Wattenmeer will ask in a state of shock: Has everyone gone mad? Natural beauty and cultural landscapes have mutated into industrial complexes, chaotically blighted with an arsenal of wind turbines.  […] Landscapes that are thousands of years old have been aesthetically and ecologically completely destroyed.”
Europe is not the only place that has managed to fully ruin its environment with its “nature protection” programs. A reader just sent me a photo from Aruba. Here’s how this paradise looks today now that environmentalists have implemented their nature protection measures:

Aren’t they just lovely? You just possibly couldn’t think of a better way to protect the environment.

"Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and the UK’s largest asset manager are among 87 major companies and investors who have written to Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, urging his government to stop further deforestation of the Amazon for soy production. The preservation of the Amazon rainforest, a vital sink for carbon dioxide, is widely considered by scientists and activists to be a priority in responding to the climate crisis. However, the Brazilian soy farmers’ association Aprosoja has mounted a campaign to end a voluntary ban on trading crops harvested from newly cleared land. Aprosoja has claimed to have the backing of Bolsonaro, who has come under heavy international criticism as he advocated increased economic development of the Amazon even as vast fires burned swathes of rainforest during the summer. Many of those fires were started deliberately by farmers to clear land for crops or cattle. The letter to the Brazilian government calls for the extension of the Amazon soy moratorium (ASM), a 2006 agreement signed by companies to prevent the use of new land for the production of soy. Soy is used mainly as agricultural feed, as well as a food for human consumption such as tofu and soy sauce. The signatories to the letter include some of Europe and the UK’s largest supermarket chains – including Aldi, Asda, Carrefour, Iceland, Marks & Spencer, Waitrose and Morrisons – and food producers such as Mars. Investor signatories, who together control assets worth more than £2.5tn, include the Dutch firm Robeco and the Canadian investor BMO Global Asset Management, as well as Legal & General Investment Management, the UK’s largest asset manager. The letter said: “We want to be able to continue to source from, or invest in, the Brazilian soy industry but if the ASM is not maintained, this will risk our business with Brazilian soy.” Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents many of the signatories, said they were seeking assurances from the Brazilian government that the moratorium would remain. “Customers expect the products they buy not to harm the environment, and retailers invest heavily in their supply chains to deliver that as far as possible,” he said. The letter, which was coordinated by the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative, argued that continued increases in soy production were possible without further destroying the rainforest. Brazil was the world’s largest soybean exporter in 2016-17, sending 60.3m metric tonnes abroad, the vast majority to China’s rapidly expanding meat industry, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Lower land and labour costs than the US have made Brazil the key sources of soybeans to China. China’s dependence on Brazil for the crop increased last year, when US soybeans were the subject of retaliatory tariffs in the trade war between Beijing and Washington. In March scientists writing in the Nature journal warned of a possible “surge of tropical deforestation” in the wake of the tariffs, as Bolsonaro’s government weakened protections and Brazilian producers sought to replace their US rivals. Bolsonaro’s widely condemned policies have drawn comparisons with his US counterpart, Donald Trump, who has also advocated deregulation – in the face of a global consensus in favour of action on the environment. In the US more than 70 CEOs, companies and union leaders signed a separate letter published on Monday calling for the US to remain within the Paris Climate Agreement, only weeks after Trump began the year-long process to exit the international accord. The signatories include two of the world’s biggest tech firms, Google and Microsoft, and the FTSE-listed energy company National Grid. John Pettigrew, National Grid’s chief executive, said: “The scale and potential impact of the climate crisis has never been more real. The promise of the Paris Agreement is one of a just and prosperous world – something that can only be achieved through a collective effort of business, unions and governments that places climate action at the heart of everything we do.”"
"Banking giant HSBC has pledged US$100 billion (£76 billion) to “fight climate change”, to be spent on sustainable finance and investment over the next eight years. It also commits to increasing its own use of renewable energy and to reducing its funding of coal projects.  HSBC is following a growing trend among investment banks which includes a US$200 billion funding commitment from JP Morgan Chase, the acquisition of the UK’s Green Investment Bank by Macquarie, and exits from coal lending by Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole and others. I know a fair bit about such deals as I have been an energy investment banker for 25 years and now assess the sector in my research at the University of Bath and Imperial College. So how significant are these moves and what might their impact be? Undoubtedly the move to a green economy requires significant investment, over and above today’s levels. For 2016-2030, the OECD estimates an additional US$600 billion infrastructure investment per year is needed to meet Paris Agreement climate goals, across energy, transportation and other sectors.  As part of this transition, green energy investment is already growing rapidly: the United Nations reports doubling of clean energy asset finance over the past decade, with US$1,657 billion being raised in total 2007-2016, much of it from bank lending. So US$300 billion over the next decade from HSBC and JP Morgan, while significant, will not in itself be game-changing. It does, however, reflect the continued growth that we have seen for some time, driven by the declining cost of renewable power and broadly supportive government policies. Banks are also encouraging the growth of the “green bond” market, where companies and governments raise money specifically for environmentally positive projects such as new wind farms, solar technology or more energy efficient housing – with the money ring-fenced and externally monitored. The green bond market remains small, at less than 2% of annual global bond issuance. However volumes are growing rapidly and observers including the OECD see this market as important to climate finance. HSBC and other banks have been active in green bonds, issuing their own bonds and helping others access the market. There are concerns that bank lending may decline over time due to regulatory changes such as the Basel III framework, which requires banks to decrease their leverage and keep more capital in reserve. Governments are therefore also encouraging greater investment directly by large institutional investors such as pension or life insurance funds. Increasing equity and debt investment into a better structured pipeline of clean energy projects is a challenge for policymakers and financiers alike. Likewise, much climate-related investment is needed in emerging markets or for high-risk early-stage innovation and development. For example MIT last year highlighted the decline in clean-tech venture capital funding, despite increased lending and investment for the deployment of existing technologies. It may be that continued overall commercial bank lending for “safe bets” (such as British wind farms that use established technology) does little to support these more difficult areas. Some question banks’ motivation: pressure group Banking on Climate Change points out that the world’s largest banks lent $290 billion to coal, liquid natural gas and environmentally sensitive oil projects in 2014-16, with JP Morgan the third-largest lender and HSBC at number eight. Announcing green finance packages is one way of deflecting criticism for such activities. Likewise, the risk of climate change litigation is rising, with Columbia Law School pointing to the tripling of climate cases since 2014. A recent action against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia highlights the potential for banks to be sued. In the face of litigation, now withdrawn, CBA acknowledged climate change as a significant risk, published a climate policy for the first time and withdrew from lending to a controversial coal project. Actions like those announced by HSBC this week, can be seen in the context of avoiding similar issues. That said, HSBC and others may well be following growing demand from their own – particularly younger – customers for sustainability-related products. All successful organisations need to adapt to changes in customer preferences, and any generational shift in environmental views requires banks – like other companies – to adjust their marketing approach. So what are we to conclude from these moves? Increased green lending by commercial banks, while not the whole answer, is to be welcomed. Continuing to finance the growing deployment of increasingly low-cost renewable energy contributes positively to climate change action. In the face of increasing scrutiny of potential negative contribution by lenders – in the coal sector for example – it’s understandable that banks want to be able to trumpet their green credentials.  More is needed – from governments, development agencies, long-term investors and banks alike – but recent moves by HSBC and others are a step forward. It will be interesting to look back from 2020 at the relative levels of investment actually delivered to both renewables and more carbon-intensive sectors."

Share this...FacebookTwitterBy now we have all learned that wind and solar energy are highly volatile sources, and thus massively strain the power grids they get fed into once a certain scale is reached. This is now especially the case in Germany, a country that has, in an uncontrolled manner, aggressively installed wind and solar energy over the past decade.
Little wonder the German government stepped in and recently scaled back the subsidies.
But the recent government action has come too late. Yesterday Germany’s flagship daily the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung here posted a DPA news release on the mounting woes of the German Energiewende (transition to renewable energies). It begins with:
In 2015 grid operators had to intervene in the power grid like never before in order to prevent the lights in Germany from going out. The bill will be picked up by the consumer.”
During windy days, wind turbines often produce too much energy, energy that no one needs, and grid operators such as Tennet in turn force wind parks to close down to keep the grid from melting down. However, the grid operators still have to pay these shut down wind farms for the power that would have been produced. As more wind power comes online, wind park operators are forced to shut down more and more often, but with pay. The result – more costs for the grid operator. These costs from payments for unproduced electricity of course get passed along to the consumers. The FAZ writes:
The power consumers are going to feel this development over the coming year, as feed-in tariffs for green energy now make up 20% of the electricity bill.
The result? Costs from feed-in tariffs are expected to rise another 6% or more this year alone, the FAZ writes.
The German flagship daily also writes of numerous grid bottlenecks and unstable conditions, and grid operators are frequently forced to intervene to prevent blackouts – often temporarily shutting down regular power plants in an attempt to relieve overloads – thus making them unprofitable.
As more and more wind and solar energy are added on without any notion of planning, Germany’s power grid is now in dire need of massive revamping. Huge power transmission lines need to be built across the country in order to balance out the huge regional power overloads cause by volatile wind and sun. Not only is this going to take time, but it is also going to cost many billions more, the FAZ reports.

"It has been heartening to see how the climate emergency has finally risen up the political agenda in recent months. What has had much less attention, but is equally urgent, is the catastrophic decline in our nature and wildlife. The UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world, and the situation is getting worse. A 2019 report into the state of British nature paints a bleak picture: nearly half the species assessed showed strong or moderate decline over the last decade; 15% of the UK’s wildlife species are threatened with extinction. Birds and animals that were familiar to our parents and grandparents, such as the curlew, water vole, adder or common toad, are now rare sights. We have hundreds of wonderful conservation organisations in this country such as the RSPB, the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, Plantlife, the Marine Conservation Society and more. They do important work, aided by people’s generosity and committed volunteers. But they have not been able to halt the precipitous decline in our wildlife. The Green party has always had the most ambitious policies on nature of any political party, with more than 70 such proposals in our current manifesto, from reducing pesticide use to repurposing our economy. But it is not enough to have strong policies: we need to be constantly challenged to go further. That is why, earlier this year, I commissioned a report from five of the leading conservationists and nature writers in Britain to produce a blueprint for how we ensure nature’s survival. It is called A New Deal for Nature.  Its proposals address individual, public and government action. They cover national parks, farming, biosecurity, the marine environment and more. They also focus on education: how to give children access to nature so that they recognise the natural world, grow to love it and feel the need to protect it. Among the recommendations are a GCSE in natural history (which I have championed for several years) and introducing an hour of outdoor learning every day in every primary school. We are lucky to have a number of magnificent national parks in Britain, but they were originally founded to preserve landscape beauty and give public access to green space. There was no requirement to protect wildlife. That needs to change. Nature reserves are often islands of biodiversity. If they are cut off from each other, there is little opportunity for wildlife populations to spread. They need connecting corridors to create a network throughout Britain – another of the report’s recommendations. Most of us – 83% – live in towns or cities. This has helped foster a sense that nature is what happens elsewhere, in the countryside, so we don’t recognise wildlife in our own neighbourhood. Peregrine falcons can already be seen in some of our cities. More species could thrive if we helped; and creating greener, more biodiverse cities would improve our wellbeing too. There are many ways to do this, beginning with casting off the obsession with tidiness in parks and gardens and making more wild areas. Also, some of our best wildlife areas are old industrial brownfield sites. The report suggests giving them “pop-up” status as sites of special scientific interest, and incentivising developers to leave derelict land for wildlife for 10-year periods. The authors say their aim is to be radical, aspirational and inclusive – guided by the best science available. Some of their proposals are controversial and challenging. But we need to be pushed out of our comfort zone of weekend walks in the country, occasional visits to national parks, or curling up on the sofa in front of Countryfile – which give the impression that all is well. It isn’t. I have said over the past few weeks that this general election is the climate election, but nature and the climate crisis are inextricably linked. We need a healthy natural world if we are to have any chance of tackling the climate emergency. • Caroline Lucas is seeking re-election as the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion"
"More than 110,000 people were moved from their homes following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in March 2011. Another 50,000 left of their own will, and 85,000 had still not returned four-and-a-half years later. While this might seem like an obvious way of keeping people safe, my colleagues and I have just completed research that shows this kind of mass evacuation is unnecessary, and can even do more harm than good. We calculated that the Fukushima evacuation extended the population’s average life expectancy by less than three months. To do this, we had to estimate how such a nuclear meltdown could affect the average remaining life expectancy of a population from the date of the event. The radiation would cause some people to get cancer and so die younger than they otherwise would have (other health effects are very unlikely because the radiation exposure is so limited). This brings down the average life expectancy of the whole group.  But the average radiation cancer victim will still live into their 60s or 70s. The loss of life expectancy from a radiation cancer will always be less than from an immediately fatal accident such as a train or car crash. These victims have their lives cut short by an average of 40 years, double the 20 years that the average sufferer of cancer caused by radiation exposure. So if you could choose your way of dying from the two, radiation exposure and cancer would on average leave you with a much longer lifespan. To work out how much a specific nuclear accident will affect life expectancy, we can use something called the CLEARE (Change of life expectancy from averting a radiation exposure) Programme). This tells us how much a specific dose of radiation will shorten your remaining lifespan by on average. Yet knowing how a nuclear meltdown will affect average life expectancy isn’t enough to work out whether it is worth evacuating people. You also need to measure it against the costs of the evacuation. To do this, we have developed a method known as the judgement or J-value. This can effectively tell us how much quality of life people are willing to sacrifice to increase their remaining life expectancy, and at what point they are no longer willing to pay. You can work out the J-value for a specific country using a measure of the average amount of money people in that country have (GDP per head) and a measure of how averse to risk they are, based on data about their work-life balance. When you put this data through the J-value model, you can effectively find the maximum amount people will on average be willing to pay for longer life expectancy. After applying the J-value to the Fukushima scenario, we found that the  amount of life expectancy preserved by moving people away was too low to justify it. If no one had been evacuated, the local population’s average life expectancy would have fallen by less than three months. The J-value data tells us that three months isn’t enough of a gain for people to be willing to sacrifice the quality of life lost through paying their share of the cost of an evacuation, which can run into billions of dollars (although the bill would actually be settled by the power company or government). The three month average loss suggests the number of people who will actually die from radiation-induced cancer is very small. Compare it to the average of 20 years lost when you look at all radiation cancer sufferers. In another comparison, the average inhabitant of London loses 4.5 months of life expectancy because of the city’s air pollution. Yet no one has suggested evacuating that city.   We also used the J-value to examine the decisions made after the world’s worst nuclear accident, which occurred 25 years before Fukushima at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. In that case, 116,000 people were moved out in 1986, never to return, and a further 220,000 followed in 1990.  By calculating the J-value using data on people in Ukraine and Belarus in the late 1980s and early 1990s, we can work out the minimum amount of life expectancy people would have been willing to evacuate for. In this instance, people should only have been moved if their lifetime radiation exposure would have reduced their life expectancy by nine months or more. This applied to just 31,000 people. If we took a more cautious approach and said that if one in 20 of a town’s inhabitants lost this much life expectancy, then the whole settlement should be moved, it would still only mean the evacuation of 72,500 people. The 220,000 people in the second relocation lost at most three months’ life expectancy and so none of them should have been moved. In total, only between 10% and 20% of the number relocated needed to move away. To support our research, colleagues at the University of Manchester analysed hundreds of possible large nuclear reactor accidents across the world. They found relocation was not a sensible policy in any of the expected case scenarios they examined. Some might argue that people have the right to be evacuated if their life expectancy is threatened at all. But overspending on extremely expensive evacuation can actually harm the people it is supposed to help. For example, the World Heath Organisation has documented the psychological damage done to the Chernobyl evacuees, including their conviction that they are doomed to die young. From their perspective, this belief is entirely logical. Nuclear refugees can’t be expected to understand exactly how radiation works, but they know when huge amounts of money are being spent. These payments can come to be seen as compensation, suggesting the radiation must have left them in an awful state of health. Their governments have never lavished such amounts of money on them before, so they believe their situation must be dire. But the reality is that, in most cases, the risk from radiation exposure if they stay in their homes is minimal. It is important that the precedents of Chernobyl and Fukushima do not establish mass relocation as the prime policy choice in the future, because this will benefit nobody."
"“It has always been our ambition to get inside that white space, and now we are there the space can no longer be blank,” wrote the polar explorer Captain Scott, on crossing the 80th parallel of the Antarctic continent for the first time in 1902. Fast-forward more than a century – and the deep ocean floor around Antarctica still offers a “white space”, beyond the reach of scuba divers, only partially mapped in detail by sonar from ships and seldom surveyed by robotic vehicles. So I jumped at the chance to join a team from the BBC on an expedition to the Antarctic Peninsula for Blue Planet II, to help them as a scientific guide. Thanks to the crew of the research ship Alucia, we dived in minisubmarines to 1km deep in the Antarctic for the first time. And while we didn’t face anything like the physical hardships endured by early polar explorers on land, those dives did give us the opportunity for some unique science. The deep ocean around Antarctica is a special place for several reasons.  Because Antarctica is pushed down by the weight of its ice sheets, the submerged continental shelf around it is deeper than usual, around 500-600m deep at its edge rather than 100-200m deep. It’s also cut by even deeper channels close inshore, some plunging more than 1km, scoured out by larger ice sheets in the past. So although the continent itself is remote, we can reach the deep ocean close inshore here – handy for us diving in minisubmarines, despite the need to dodge icebergs. There’s a gateway to the deep for marine life here too. Some deep-sea animals come into much shallower depths than usual around Antarctica, because the water temperature near the surface is similar to the cold temperatures elsewhere in the deep ocean. And in the past, shallow-living ancestors of some deep-sea animals spread out across the deep oceans from the Antarctic, via this cold gateway between the shallows and the deep. One of my favourite animals that we saw on dives was the octopus Graneledone antarctica, whose ancestor ventured down from the shallows around 15m years ago, when the water temperature at the surface cooled to the same chilly temperature as the deep. Her descendants then spread out across the abyss like wagon-train pioneers, giving rise to several different species of deep-sea octopus found around the world today. Some stayed behind, however, becoming the species that we saw. The ocean around Antarctica is also the lungs of the deep. Much of the life-giving oxygen in deep waters across the world begins its journey from the atmosphere here. As seawater freezes around the white continent in winter, it leaves behind very cold and salty water that sinks and flows into the depths of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans – even the deepest water in the ocean, at the bottom of the Marianas Trench 14,000km away, came from here. As this deep water flows out from the Antarctic, it carries oxygen, dissolved from the atmosphere at the surface. So the Antarctic is where the world’s deep oceans breathe in – and its waters are among the most oxygen-rich on our planet. Another of my favourite animals from our dives takes advantage of those oxygen-rich waters: giant sea-spiders, with legspans up to 40cm across. Sea spiders lack a respiratory system, which usually limits their size, but can grow much larger in the oxygen-rich conditions here. Diving in the Antarctic is also a journey back in time, to glimpse what ancient ocean ecosystems were once like. Fish dominate as predators in most marine ecosystems today, but few fish species can cope with the -1.5℃ conditions where we were diving. The “ice dragonfish”, Cryodraco antarcticus, is a notable exception, however, and another of my favourite animals – with antifreeze proteins that stop its blood from icing up. Its blood is also clear, without any of the oxygen-carrying haemoglobin that gives ours its red colour – in the cold waters, enough oxygen dissolves directly in the fluid of the fish’s blood to keep it alive. But there are few fish with remarkable adaptations like the ice dragon, and so invertebrates have diversified to dominate as predators in the deep ocean here, just as they did throughout the oceans more than 350m years ago. A final favourite from our dives epitomises that: the Antarctic sunstar Labidiaster annulatus, which is a relative of the familiar five-armed starfish. Nicknamed “the Death Star” by those inside the subs who watched its behaviour, it has up to 50 arms and grows larger than a dinner plate. It uses those arms like fishing rods, holding them up off the seabed to snag passing krill, thanks to tiny pincers on its skin that snap shut when anything brushes past them. Unlike other starfish, Labidiaster can wave its arms to catch prey here because there are relatively few predatory fish to chew them off. Overall, seeing the deep Antarctic sea floor close-up from our minisubs should help us to understand how “dropstones” shape the pattern of life here.  “Dropstones” are car-sized boulders that fall from passing icebergs – they provide “islands” of rocky habitat for filter-feeding species which otherwise don’t get a look-in on the soft mud of the Antarctic seafloor. But where the dropstones settle depends on the undersea terrain. As we found on our dives, they slide down steeper undersea slopes, actually scraping off marine life. But if you’re at the bottom of a gully, then lots of dropstones end up there, giving a major boost to local biodiversity. That pattern of life is hard to see from samples collected by nets or trawls in the past, so our first minisub dives to 1km deep in the Antarctic should help to make that “white space” no longer such a blank."

Obviously people have been asking why some environmentally active and veggie-leaning people are acting so weird, irrational and at times even hysterical, especially when it comes to climate change. Looks like nutrition may actually be one factor here – in addition to the sorrowful state of Western education and academia.
Nutrition is often a seriously under-estimated factor when it comes to our health – really! Being deficient in just one or two vitamins, and/or minerals or trace elements is enough to make any person seriously ill. Poor nutrition during pregnancy can lead to severe birth defects. Nutritional deficiencies are also often the root cause of mental illness and depression. Too often people totally under-estimate the role of nutrition in their health.
The now famous University of Graz study came up with some sobering findings:
1. Vegetarians are more often ill and have a lower quality of living than meat-eaters.
2. Vegetarians showed 166% higher cancer rates (4.8% to 1.8%).

3. Vegans had a 150% higher rate of heart attacks (1.5% to 0.6%).
4. Vegetarian’s show more psychological disorders than meat eaters.
5. They are a greater burden on the health care system.
6. Vegetarians have twice as many allergies as big meat-eaters.
I don’t want to discourage people from eating vegetarian diets, as these can be highly beneficial IF they include eggs, dairy products and fish on a regular basis. For example for people who suffer from obesity, the vegetarian diet can actually be therapeutic if not taken to an extreme – and done over a limited period, monitored by a competent physician.
However, people who are considering the vegan lifestyle – one that rejects the consumption of almost every animal-based food product – they absolutely need to be extremely wary. The draconian diet often FALSELY promises health. Most experts will tell you that veganism is a very risky and potentially dangerous diet – especially for children and pregnant women.
By nature the human organism, forged by some 3 million years of evolution, is an omnivore and thus is designed to consume, digest and metabolize both animal and plant-based foods. A balanced diet is imperative for maintaining good health. Deny this at your own risk.

Glacier, Ice Sheet Melt Rates Slowing!
By Kenneth Richard
In recent years glacier and ice sheet melt rates have been rapidly decelerating in several regions of the globe.

For illustration only. By Beeblebrox – Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11810995
According to published scientific study by Jacob et al. (2012, Recent Contributions of Glaciers and Ice Caps [GIC] to Sea Level Rise), glaciers and ice caps across the world (excluding Greenland and Antarctica) in total only contributed 0.41 mm/yr (~1.6 inches per century) to sea level rise between 2003 and 2010.
This was an overall 30% deceleration from previous year’s estimates, with glaciers in the high mountains of Asia effectively in balance. The abstract states the results are based on a global, simultaneous inversion of monthly GRACE-derived satellite gravity fields, from which the scientists calculate the mass change over all ice-covered regions greater in area than 100 sq km.
The scientists say that the GIC rate for 2003-2010 is about 30 per cent smaller than the previous mass balance estimate that most closely matches their study period. Particularly the high mountains of Asia show a mass loss of only 4 ± 20 gigatons per year for 2003-2010, compared with 47-55 Gt yr(-1) in previously published estimates.
Examining Jacob et al. (2012) further, the scientists indicate that the 0.41 mm/yr for 2003-2010 is well less than half the melt rate contribution for the first 5 or 6 years of the 21st century (~0.8 to ~1.1 mm/yr), and even slightly less than the rate for the entire 1961-2004 period (0.4 to 0.5 mm/yr).
The scientists conclude:
Excluding Greenland and Antarctic peripheral GICs [glaciers and ice caps] (PGICs), GICs have variously been reported to have 0.43–0.51 mm yr to sea level rise (SLR) during 1961–2004, 0.77 mm yr during 2001–2004, 1.12 mm yr during 2001–2005 and 0.95 mm yr during 2002–2006.”

Some glaciers have reversed course, and now advancing
Furthermore a recently published (2016) paper indicates that the high mountain glaciers of Asia have actually begun advancing since 2009 (through 2014). A new paper published earlier this year by Zhang, Zhen et al shows similar developments. The scientists state that the glacier mass changes in the Muztag Ata and Kongur Tagh (MAKT) region in the eastern Pamir, northwestern China, is helpful in improving our knowledge of the dynamics of glaciers under a changing climate in High Mountain Asia. They summarize their findings in the paper’s abstract:
Here, glacier area and mass changes derived from remote sensing data are investigated for the period 1971/76–2013/14 for glaciers in MAKT. We have used ASTER images (2013/14), Cartosat-1 (2014) and Landsat, SRTM (Shuttle Radar Terrain Mission) digital elevation model (DEM) (2000), topographic maps (1971/76) and the first and second Chinese glacier inventories (CGIs). Our results indicated that the glacier area of MAKT decreased from 1018.3 ± 12.99 km2 in 1971/ 76 to 999.2 ± 31.22 km2 in 2014 (–1.9 ± 0.2%). Weak area shrinkage of glaciers by 2.5 ± 0.5 km2 (0.2 ± 0.1%) happened after 2000 and the period 2009–2014 even saw a slight expansion by 0.5 ± 0.1 km2 (0.1 ± 0.0%).”
Yet another 2016 paper in the Internal Journal of Quaternary Research authored by a team led by Ireneuzw Sobota indicates that the Aavatsmarkbreen glacier (Svalbard) advanced by over 1 km between 2013 and 2015. The study’s main objective, according to the authors, was to analyse and classify subglacial and supraglacial landforms in the context of glacial deformation and basal sliding over a thin layer of thawed, water-saturated deposits. The study also focused on the geomorphological evidence of surge-related sub- and supraglacial crevassing and glacier front fracturing. The results:
From 2006 to 2013, the average recession of Aavatsmarkbreen was 363 m (52 m a−1). A subsequent surge during 2013–2015 resulted in a substantial advance of the glacier front of over 1 km and an increase in its surface area of more than 2 sq. km.”
This rapid regional (Arctic) glacier expansion since 2013 coincides with Greenland’s recent ice sheet melt deceleration. According to the Arctic Report Card (2015), after losing an average of ~260 Gt per year from 2002 to 2013, ice sheet losses decelerated to -29 gigatons and -186 gigatons in 2013-14 and 2014-15 respectively.
The ice mass loss of 186 Gt over the entire ice sheet between April 2014 and April 2015 was 22% below the average mass loss of 238 Gt for the 2002- 2015 period, but was 6.4 times higher than the 29 Gt loss of the preceding 2013-2014 season. They add:
The net area loss from marine-terminating glaciers during 2014-2015 was 16.5 sq km..  This was the lowest annual net area loss of the period of observations (1999-2015) and 7.7 times lower than the annual average area change trend of -127 sq km.”
And, already for 2016, the surface mass balance (see graph below, blue trend line) is well above the 1990-2013 mean, marking the third straight year of Greenland ice sheet melt deceleration.

"Looking up from his cup of tea in a central London cafe, Tom Bailey stops mid-sentence, exasperated. One of the key architects behind Labour’s plan for a green industrial revolution, Bailey wants to make clear that the work to which he and a team of academics, engineers and economists have dedicated their spare time over the past 18 months is “a no-brainer”. “Most of this stuff was already out there,” says the 35-year-old. “If we had written this 10 or 15 years ago it would have looked very similar. The curves on the graphs would be slightly less steep because at that stage we had not wasted a decade or more. Now we just need to get on with it.”  For many climate scientists, the action that politicians take – or fail to take – in the next 10 years will decide humanity’s fate. This has left many normally cautious experts – and a growing number of ordinary people, from schoolchildren to pensioners – frustrated and terrified by the lack of serious political engagement with the climate emergency. But while other topics, from Brexit to the NHS, have often dominated the election debate, there are signs – from hunger-striking climate activists camped outside party HQs, to the world’s first televised leaders’ debate on the ecological crisis – that the issue is starting to cut through. Bailey believes Labour, at least, has understood the existential challenge facing humanity. “We have been waiting for a mainstream political party to look this in the face and realise what is needed, and this is exactly what we have got with this plan. This is enough to stop climate change from an energy point of view. It is that simple.” Labour's 'green new deal' - or 'green industrial revolution' - proposes a massive programme of state investment to rapidly decarbonise the economy, creating hundreds of thousands of green jobs, and transforming the way people live - from upgrading the housing stock to revitalising public transport, tackling the UK’s air pollution crisis to moving towards a more sustainable agricultural model. Although the initial investment would be huge, advocates say that would be dwarfed by the cost of not tackling the escalating climate crisis and point to wide-ranging economic benefits in the medium term, positioning the UK at the forefront of the emerging green industries, which are expected to dominate in the coming years. Crucially, the green new deal would tie radical environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by – and benefits – ordinary people. Its advocates say jobs in carbon-intensive industries would be replaced by – among others – those in wind, solar, house building and transport infrastructure. Labour's manifesto put the green new deal at the centre of its 2019 election campaign. The idea has also been championed by leading Democratic presidential candidates in the US 2020 race. Internationally, its supporters say any such proposal must also recognise the west’s historic responsibility for the crisis - and its global nature - and support a just transition in the developing world through transfers of technology and finance, while welcoming migrants. Matthew Taylor Labour’s offer on the environment is certainly a key part of its bid to win office on 12 December. Its framing of a green industrial revolution is central to its transformative programme and would, it says, fix the economy, cut carbon emissions and create 1m well-paid green jobs. But it is not the only party to give prominence to the crisis. An analysis of the parties’ manifestos by Greenpeace found that the Green party had the best offer on the climate, scoring 19 out of 20, with Labour on 16, the Lib Dems on 15 and the Tories just seven. Bailey says the key difference in Labour’s plan is that it ties radical environmental action to a worker-led “just transition”, where the rapid move from a carbon-based economy to a sustainable system is led by and benefits ordinary people. The manifesto makes no hard commitment to reaching zero carbon by 2030. This was seized on as evidence that, under pressure from trade unions, Labour’s final offer lacks real teeth. But grassroots groups such as Momentum and Labour for Green New Deal, which have been pushing a radical green agenda within the party for months, welcomed the party’s commitment to transform the economy and the pledge to achieve the “substantial majority” of emissions reductions by 2030. Bailey, the lead author of Labour’s plan to decarbonise the UK’s energy sector, which has been adopted wholesale in the party’s manifesto, is adamant the offer is “hugely transformational … and would mean changes for every person, every building, every piece of infrastructure, every institution. “It would put UK energy supply and use – which is the source for a majority of UK emissions – more than in line with what the scientists say is necessary to keep warming below 1.5C [above pre-industrial levels]. In fact, it goes even further than is required by the science, putting the UK in a global leadership position and allowing developing countries space to transition equitably.” Bailey got a master’s in sustainable engineering from Imperial College in London before spending a decade working in the green energy sector in the UK, US and China. In his current day job (all the work for Labour has been strictly in his spare time), Bailey works for C40, an organisation that brings together almost 100 of the world’s leading cities to help coordinate action on the climate emergency. When he began work 13 years ago, he was hopeful about politicians’ determination to tackle the climate crisis. “That was a time when there was huge optimism, it felt like we had this massive issue of climate change, which was undoubtedly really scary but actually it felt like everyone realised the scale of this and were beginning to act accordingly.” He says the introduction of the Climate Change Act, the Stern review and “lots of detailed discussion about the policies that were needed” left him and others in the sector confident that the political class had the crisis in hand. So he went into the private sector with the aim of rolling out the policies and technologies to avoid a catastrophic climate breakdown. What happened next left him despondent. He says that after the 2008 financial crash, the political class backed away from taking the necessary measures. Depressed about the level of debate and action in the UK after 2010, Bailey left to work overseas, returning just before the 2017 election. “When I got back I read Labour’s manifesto and was really impressed with its ambition. I remember being genuinely excited. Then to see that sort of ambition do pretty well in an election felt like a real moment – something we collectively had a duty to get behind.” Shortly after the vote he contacted party officials and asked if they needed any help “deepening the technical side of their policies”. Labour took him up on the offer and within weeks Bailey was pulling together a team of interdisciplinary experts – economists, engineers, regulators, academics and technicians – who all gave their time for free. “There was no hesitation at all from the people I approached. We are all energy and climate professionals in our 20s or 30s, millennials, who have really lived with this issue in our personal and professional lives. They know the facts around what we are facing, know the answers and see this as our last best chance to change course.” The fruits of the group’s work were laid out in a 185-page report – Thirty by 2030 – released with little fanfare in October. The recommendations are now official party policy. Among the report’s highlights are plans by 2030 to: Upgrade every home, public, commercial and industrial building in the UK with insulation and double-glazing, focusing on poor damp homes and areas of fuel poverty first. Fully decarbonise 90% of electricity through a “huge and immediate” expansion in renewables, including 7,000 new offshore wind turbines, 2,000 new onshore wind turbines and enough new solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches. Decarbonise 50% of UK heat with solutions such as the installation of 8m heat pumps. Although the initial investment would be huge – in the hundreds of billions – the report says the programme would boost the UK economy by £800bn by 2030, create 1m jobs, leave householders better off and save at least 6,000 lives by drastically improving air quality across the UK. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has criticised some of Labour’s plans, has not questioned the details of its green new deal programme although its director, Paul Johnson, said it would be difficult to deliver the “scale of increase in capital spending … at least in the near term.” Bailey says the sums underpinning the plan were done by a “world-leading team” at Leeds University, and the final version was sent out to academics and policy experts who reviewed the findings and gave feedback before endorsing the proposals as “the upper limit of feasibility, but appropriate to the climate emergency we find ourselves in”. He says there has been little or no opposition to the plans from regulators, technical experts, economists, academics or unions, mainly because “for those who have been paying attention to the unfolding climate disaster, the solutions have been clear for years. There is such clarity about what the next steps are, and this is what has led to so much frustration. We could have done this a decade ago.” Next year the UK hosts the UN climate summit, and whoever is leading the UK government will have a unique opportunity to shape how the world responds to the crisis. Bailey says no one should be in any doubt about what is at stake when they go to the polling booths next week. “This is our last chance to start acting on this. It is the make-or-break moment.”"
"The Sunday roast is an institution for many families across the globe. From Australia to the UK, families come together on a Sunday to share a meal. More often than not, this meal is centred around a joint of roast meat – traditionally lamb or beef. The health implications and environmental impacts of our diet have now become a regular discussion topic, with sustainable dietary advice recommending that we reduce meat consumption and increase our consumption of plant-based proteins, fruits and vegetables. But what does this practically mean: how can we eat for health and sustainability on a day-to-day basis? Sources advocate shifting to a fully plant-based, vegetarian diet. Many people are resistant to this level of dietary change, however. But, as the old saying goes, every little helps. Many are opting for “meat-free Mondays” or even meat-free lunches. Messing with the Sunday roast, however, is a step too far for most. But given its focus on huge hunks of meat and energy inefficient cooking methods, it’s important to consider. So how might we create a more sustainable Sunday roast? The Sunday roast - like most meals using animal products - has a high environmental impact. The joint of meat itself can account for up to 60%-70% of the environmental impacts of the entire meal. This is due to the large amounts of water, land, and feed required to produce meat.  Purchasing sustainable and ethically farmed meat with lower environmental impacts can result in small (~5%) environmental savings. However, to really reduce the environmental impact of meat, we need to eat less of it. So reducing the amount of meat is therefore the first step towards creating a sustainable Sunday roast.  The portion sizes for roast meats depend on the recipe used and can vary widely. Many roast beef recipes suggest between 125g-800g per person. In the UK, dietary guidance suggests eating below 70g of red and processed meat per day, these are very large portions indeed. Such large portions of beef can be partly explained by the need for leftovers in traditional recipes. But in today’s busy world, leftovers can easily become food waste. In 2014, a shocking 8% of beef purchased by UK households became food waste. Over half of this was totally avoidable, caused by the cooking, serving or preparing of too much food, or leftovers not being used in time. With this in mind, our sustainable Sunday roast requires small portions – say 125g per person, meaning 50-70g for lunch, and a manageable amount for leftovers the next day. A further benefit of cutting meat portions for a sustainable roast is that it will have a shorter cooking time, meaning less energy to cook, and reduced associated environmental impacts. Cooking is the other main contributor to this. The oven is an inefficient way of cooking meat at hot temperatures, and for long periods of time. The environmental impact of roasting a joint of meat for over an hour in an oven contributes 20-30% of the environmental impacts of the entire meal.  To make matters worse, overcooking roasts – for an extra 41 minutes, for example – adds further impacts through pointless energy use.  So as well as reducing the amount of meat served, we might also use new methods to cook a sustainable Sunday roast. Reverse searing involves cooking the joint of beef in low heat oven or a slow cooker – until the internal temperature of the joint is between 55-60°C (the temperature that medium done beef is cooked to) – and then transferring it to pan and searing the joint. Depending on the energy efficiency of your oven or slow cooker, reverse searing may well have a lower impact than traditional cooking. Cooking sous vide, meanwhile, involves placing a joint of beef in a vacuumed plastic pouch or bag, and submerging this in a heated water bath for several hours until the internal temperature of the joint is between 55-60°C. The joint is then unwrapped and placed in a hot skillet to sear its surface. Although this may sound like a lot of work, the method gives the cook total control of the texture and flavour and can use less than half the energy of a traditional oven method.    By combining sustainable sourced meat, a reduced portion size, and modern cooking methods, we could reduce the environmental impacts of a Sunday roast by over half.  Unfortunately, reducing the environmental impact of our Sunday roast will not hugely reduce the overall environmental impact of our diet. For this we need to further reduce our meat consumption and increase our consumption of plant based proteins, fruits and vegetables across all meals. In comparison to other more plant-forward meals that could be eaten, a sustainable Sunday roast has high environmental impacts. For this reason, even the sustainable Sunday roast should be kept as a special meal, and not eaten every week.  The good news is that, if even an environmentally damaging meal such as the Sunday roast can be made a little more sustainable, it should be possible to create appetising yet sustainable versions of other popular dishes too. Editor’s note: this article was amended on November 6 to correct the description of ‘reverse searing’."

If anything the $250 million dollar project has turned into nothing less than an engineering basket case, run by two men who seem to be in midlife crisis. How many simple schools could be built in Africa with that kind of money?
The Airbus A380 dimensioned solar-powered contraption has been grounded in Hawaii, some 10 months after it began its trip in Abu Dhabi last March. Notable comments by Thomas in the Spectator article:
The fuel-free plane was meant to show the delicious potential of clean solar energy, ‘therapy for the planet’ and a climate-change stopper, […]. The solar plane’s actually demonstrated the superiority of a few drums of avgas.”

It was held up at Nagoya for a month waiting for favorable winds, much like a 17th century galleon.

Piccard says, ‘What we have here is the future’.
That would be progress going backwards in high gear. Thomas reminds us early devices did the trip far more quickly: “The Graf Zeppelin in 21 days in 1929“, and “Someone could walk the plane’s route (somehow) in two years, not much longer than the flight time.”
Of course pilot and project pitchman Piccard does not see it that way, and promotes the months-long grounded plane as breakthrough technology:

If there ever was a symbol of green delusionism, Solar Impulse 2 is it.

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
On September 16, 2015; Gernan public broadcaster Bayerischen Rundfunk (Bavarian Broadcasting, or BR) announced:
Farewell to white winters 
Light mist, no snow: It’s gotten warmer in Bavaria – and foremost in the winter and especially in the mountains. Already there is measureably less snow. Are our winters going to turn green? What does it all mean for the ski areas?”
But is this true? In the magazine GEO SAISON, 12/2015, Christian Zenkl, an independent meteorologist in Innsbruck, corrected the BR media error:
‘In the Alps region temperatures in the mountains have fallen about 1°C over the past 30 years. Because of the sunnier and warmer summers, the glaciers have lost mass and in total temperatures in the Alps have warmed. However winters have gotten somewhat colder. ‘There hasn’t been less snow,’ says Zenkl. To the contrary, there has been a positive trend starting at 1000 meters. Today from a strictly climatic view, snow-making cannons are not any more needed than they were 30 years ago.”
The expansion to 40,000 snow-making cannons is merely due to pure business reasons, e.g. extending the ski-season and competition between ski resorts. Data from the German DWD national weather service even confirm the winter season temperature cooling trend, even though you’ll never hear it from the DWD:

The German power giant was hit not only by low prices on the electricity exchanges, but the losses were also due to significant “impairment charges” as the company writes down the value of its conventional coal and gas power plant assets.

“Difficult times” says E.on Chairman of the Board and CEO Johannes Teyssen   Source : E.ON SE 
That sort of thing happens when a power company is forced by law to buy haphazard, money-losing solar and wind energy at exorbitant prices and sell it at a loss on the power exchanges. There’s no turnaround in sight.
What we are witnessing is the collapse of Germany’s power industry – thanks to the Energiewende (transition to green energies).
E.on CEO Johannes Teyssen spoke of “difficult times” at a press conference on Wednesday morning. Over the past two years the Essen-Germany-based company has lost over 10 billion euros!

Bloomberg reports here:
 ‘The general economic environment and the situation in our industry have deteriorated significantly,’ Chief Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen told reporters on Wednesday in Essen.”
Unsurprisingly the massive losses stemmed in large part from the area of power generation, where sales fell 34%. The operation of gas-fired power plants is no longer profitable due to the low prices on the energy exchanges.
Worse, the low prices from excessive production are not even making their way to the consumers. Although generated power is sold at low prices on the exchange markets due to surplus production from wind and sun, consumers are getting no benefit. German consumers are now paying near record prices for electricity (approx. €0.29/kw-h). Often coal-fired power plants run idle as well. experts have warned that the Energiewende may cost German consumers a trillion euros.
Share prices of Eon have also taken a terrible beating. In early 2008 the price for a share stood near 50 euros. Today a share stands at a measly 8 euros.
Spiegel here calls the losses at Eon “dramatic”.
Already in 2013 The Economist warned of an impending disaster for Germany’s energy sector.

"The Kipembawe Division is hidden in the southern highlands of south-west Tanzania, a long seven-hour drive north from the city of Mbeya. The scenery is stunning, yet when you look closer you can see that tobacco plants dominate agricultural areas, and the sound of trees being felled is a constant background noise. Just the word “tobacco” conjures up vivid imagery of death and disease, as depicted on graphic cigarette packets and through hard-hitting anti-smoking campaigns. But tobacco’s impact starts long before it is found wrapped in a cigarette, and affects many more people than the estimated one billion smokers worldwide. Tobacco also impacts the health and well-being of the people who grow it and the environment where it is grown, often with devastating consequences. My colleagues and I have recently published research demonstrating just how damaging it can be to the environment and communities in rural Tanzania. Most villages in Kipembawe don’t have electricity or mobile phone coverage. There are minimal healthcare facilities, and water is obtained from wells and rivers. There are few crops people can grow to make money and the dominant one is tobacco, farmed by 86% of the 196 households we surveyed. In Tanzania, 47% of the population lives below the international poverty line and rural poverty rates are even higher, where most people are reliant on agriculture. In Africa, tobacco cultivation is often associated with the presence of a dry tropical woodland called “miombo”, which dominates Kipembawe. Miombo woodland covers over 2.4m km² in Africa, but is undergoing rapid deforestation and degradation throughout its range. Both tobacco and miombo trees like sandy, slightly acidic soils. Unfortunately, these soils don’t contain many nutrients, and tobacco is one of the most nutrient-hungry crops there is. This means farmers must clear more woodland almost every year to create new fields, because the land can only support one or two cropping cycles. For tobacco leaves to be preserved for transportation and further processing they must be dried or cured. This places another burden on the trees, which are used for fuel. In total, approximately 4,134 hectares of woodland are cleared annually within Kipembawe. This reduces biodiversity and the benefits the local environment can provide people, including carbon storage, firewood, building materials and fresh water. But woodland clearance is just the start of the process. Throughout the growing season, farmers apply several rounds of fertiliser and pesticides to the crop, yet few farmers understand the risks associated with their use. During our time in Kipembawe, we didn’t see anyone using protective clothing or equipment, exposing farmers, families and labourers to harmful chemicals. What’s more, despite regulations that aim to reduce the impact of fertilisers on water sources, the crops are often initially grown close to rivers so that the distance to carry water is shorter. This means the only source of drinking water for livestock can become contaminated, causing conflict between livestock keepers and tobacco farmers. Child labour within tobacco growing is a also well-known issue, and the main tobacco organisations have joined the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing Foundation. But we saw children working in the fields, and evidence from primary schools indicates that children are likely to start working on their parents’ fields from around the age of 13. While this has obvious consequences for their education, there are also severe health impacts. Green tobacco sickness is a form of nicotine poisoning that occurs when the tobacco leaves are wet and contact the skin. Nicotine is absorbed through the skin, and leads to fever, vomiting and dizziness. While it rarely results in death it can be extremely frightening to children, who are more susceptible to severe symptoms due to a lack of nicotine tolerance and smaller body size. So why do farmers grow tobacco? Many people have few alternative ways to make a living and farmers can get a good price for top quality tobacco. This money can significantly improve the lives of the farmers, enabling them to pay school fees, invest in other businesses, and afford bicycles and solar electricity. Some men spend their money during the weeks after harvest drinking in the local pubs and pop-up bars which emerge. Canny women brew home beer from maize, and make a roaring trade. But prostitutes also flock to the area around this time, raising the risk of STI transmission. HIV rates in Mbeya are the third highest in the country, with nine per cent of 15-49 year olds testing positive for HIV – four per cent higher than the national average.  Despite the 2005 World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and falling smoking rates, global population growth means total tobacco use looks likely to keep rising in the foreseeable future. But in Kipembawe, the deforestation associated with tobacco cultivation will ultimately make production unviable because there will be no fuel left to cure the crop. This will leave the community without a significant source of income and a degraded environment. If people had other ways to make their living, it would help reduce the social and environmental burdens of tobacco production, but opportunities are limited. Tobacco production could be made more sustainable using alternative drying methods, reforestation, more efficient use of fertilisers and pesticides and land use management plans. But extensive training and support is needed, and child labour must be eliminated.  All of this will be difficult while there is such great demand for tobacco. So next time you think about lighting up, remember it’s not just your health at risk. Kicking the habit could save both trees and children’s chances."

Years ago global warming activists were warning that the days of winter carnivals were numbered, and that snow would be soon a thing of the past. Winter carnivals faced cancellations due to missing snow and balmy weather caused by manmade climate change.
This year the predictions of cancellation have finally come true – at least in Plattsburg, New York, this weekend. According to organizers, its scheduled annual carnival has been canceled – not because of a lack of snow and warm weather, but rather because of extreme cold. See forecast here.
Hat-tip: Indomitable Snowman
Temperatures this Saturday are forecast to plummet close to -30°C.
www.mychamplainvalley.com reports that the Carnival Committee spokesperson Allsion Hulbert Bruce says the decision was made on Thursday because they don’t want their volunteers or area families “exposed to the elements this weekend” … “We just think it’s safer for everyone.”

"Under an Amazonian canopy of guava and Xylopia trees, Neida Pereira lifts the lid of a beehive, gently lowers an unprotected hand into the swarm, and smiles as she lifts it out unscathed but covered in pollinators and honey. For the 49-year-old educator and environmentalist, the stingless Amazonian insects are the greatest ally she has found in a decades-long campaign to halt the destruction of the rainforest and improve the livelihoods of its people.  “Bees are everything to me. They help me to protect the forest. They help the trees to stand tall, to produce fruit and to be strong,” she says, tears welling. “The bees are much more important than me for the environment.” Pereira speaks not just from the heart, but from experience. The beekeeper was born in a remote forest community and has spent her life working for the training network, Casa Familiar Rural, in remote and threatened regions of Pará state in the north of Brazil. For her, Amazonian beehives are not just a hub of pollination, they are also the most economically viable alternative to the environmentally destructive traditions of slash-and-burn agriculture and cattle ranching. To have any chance of resisting soy plantations and mining companies, Pereira says local people need higher living standards, and an incentive to maintain the forest rather than cut it down. Beekeeping ticks all these boxes. The community here in the Gleba Lago Grande settlement is remote and until recently largely forgotten. Ownership of close to a sixth of the 300,000 hectare area is disputed between residents, land grabbers and distant property speculators. Local residents want the area to be classified as an extractive reserve, which would give protected status to them and the forest. Satellite images show strong forest cover in the area. But pressures are growing. The US mining conglomerate Alcoa is exploring bauxite deposits in the region. Emboldened by the rightwing president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, there has been an increase in illegal logging, fishing and hunting. The head of the residents’ association, Antonio Andrade, has received death threats for trying to stop this. “People ask me what right I have to tell them not to take from the forest and the river. I reply that I don’t do this for myself, I do it for future generations,” Andrade says. “Without us, the majority of the forest would be gone.” His T-shirt is emblazoned with an image of the murdered nun and environmental activist, Dorothy Stang, and her words, “The end of the forest is the end of our life.” Local people need better economic prospects, but according to the destructive logic of the past few decades, that means burning the forest and clearing the land for cattle or monocultures. But there is increasing interest in alternatives, which is where Pereira and the bees come in. With investment from the Global Greengrants Fund – one of the Guardian and Observer’s 2019 appeal charities – and its Brazilian partner CASA Socio-Environmental Fund, the region’s first beekeeping business opened in November at an agri-ecological training centre in the forest. In terms of land, labour and materials, the costs of beekeeping are minimal and the returns potentially lucrative. Showing the first pots of honey and pollen, Pereira estimates that each hive can generate 800 reais (£145 ) in six months. Multiply that by 40 and the returns on a fifth of a hectare of forested land are more than 30 times higher than they would be from the usual backbreaking economic activity of growing manioc (Cassava) on land cleared by fire. “People don’t realise yet how much income they could get from this,” she says. “We have to spread the word.” At this initial stage, the centre is only selling at local markets and relies largely on word of mouth. But they will apply for official certification so they can sell in markets. The main objective, however, is to demonstrate how Amazonian beekeeping works for local people, especially the young. Trainees come from across the region for courses lasting several days. Other units include seed cultivation, soil protection, how to improve per-hectare yields with non-fire land preparation; low-intensity cattle rearing; and reforestation with Amazonian fruit trees, such as pineapple and banana. The Casa Famlliar Rural centre aims to build a new dormitory and plans to create a nursery so that students can take saplings back with them, as well as, hopefully, bees. In the future, they would like to set up a new centre in one of the border areas most threatened by miners and loggers. “We want this to set an example for the region and the world,” said one of the founders of the centre, Paulo Brasil. Pereira says her biggest hope for the future is education. “We need to show the young that there is a different way to live with the forest. But of all the courses we teach, it’s the bees that I love the most. They are so beautiful. I can watch them all day.” Please donate to our appeal here"
"Christine Lagarde has said the European Central Bank should do more to help tackle the climate emergency, as she came under pressure from MEPs to step up action against global heating. In a strong hint that as president she would move the ECB beyond its traditional remit of controlling inflation, Lagarde said the bank would incorporate the climate threat into both its economic forecasts and in its capacity as watchdog of the financial system.  The ECB, like all central banks, uses models to forecast how the eurozone economy will work. “These models need to incorporate the risk of climate change,” said Lagarde. “That’s the very least, I think, we should expect.” The former managing director of the International Monetary Fund came under pressure at the EU committee on economic and monetary affairs over the ECB’s failure to support the greening of the eurozone economy through the purchase of bonds in environmentally friendly companies. She said the ECB’s bond portfolio – bought under its quantitative easing programme – contained “multiple shades from green to brown” because the bank operated a policy of market neutrality that ruled out stimulating a particular sector. Lagarde said the review of the ECB she had implemented after succeeding Mario Draghi as president last month would look at whether the policy should be changed. It was also important that the rating agencies took climate change into account when assessing credit-worthiness. “I would hope that the three big, well-known rating agencies (Moody’s, S&P and Fitch) move in that direction,” Lagarde said. “If they ask me my views, I will tell them.” "
"The Guardian and Observer charity appeal 2019 is supporting four charities that provide natural solutions to tackle the climate crisis: not only planting trees, but restoring and protecting existing forests, woodlands and natural habitats. This is a guide to what they do and how your donations will be spent.  Since 1993, Trees for Cities has planted more than 1m trees while working with volunteers, schools and local communities to create and revitalise green spaces in socially deprived urban neighbourhoods. Its aim is to tackle global heating, create social cohesion and beautify the UK’s cities. Its share of donations to the 2019 appeal will focus on two areas. The first is planting trees, woodlands and park projects in “forgotten places” – UK towns and cities that have historically been environmentally neglected. The second is to develop a Generation Tree programme, supporting and training individuals and community groups to create their own grassroots tree-planting projects. “We get stuck in with local communities to cultivate lasting change in their neighbourhoods – whether it’s revitalising forgotten spaces, creating healthier environments or getting people excited about growing, foraging and eating healthy food,” said David Elliott, Trees for Cities’ chief executive. The Trees for Life vision is of a revitalised wild forest in the Scottish Highlands, providing space for wildlife to flourish and communities to thrive. The aim is to rewild Dundreggan, 10,000 acres of land near Loch Ness, through tree planting and natural regeneration, providing vital natural solutions in the face of the climate crisis. The restoration of the forest – which once covered most of Scotland – will help to reduce the impact of climate change by storing carbon; it will prevent flooding and soil erosion by holding back water after rain, and nurture biodiversity. Trees for Life aims to bring more people into the world of rewilding through school programmes and volunteering. “With the support of Guardian and Observer readers, hundreds of thousands of people will get the opportunity to experience and be inspired by wild nature,” says the charity’s chief executive, Steve Micklewright. The most effective ways of tackling environmental harm and social injustice come from people on the frontlines, says Global Greengrants Fund UK, which since 2013 has supported nearly 400 grassroots organisations working to protect the planet. Global Greengrants Fund UK will serve as an intermediary for the Guardian and Observer’s 2019 appeal, using its extensive networks of expert advisers and partners in the Amazon region to distribute its share of appeal donations to local groups campaigning on climate justice, rights to land, water and resources and women’s environmental action. “Strengthening indigenous and local community land rights is key for forest protection in the Amazon. It is crucially important to tackle the global aspects of climate change on a rainforest that provides one-fifth of the world’s oxygen,” says Eva Rehse, Global Greengrants Fund UK executive director. The vision of the UK’s largest woodland conservation charity, Woodland Trust, is of a UK rich in native woods and trees for people and wildlife. Together with its 500,000 members and supporters it has planted nearly 50m trees and hundreds of new woods over the past five decades, and saved thousands of threatened woods. Its share of the appeal donations will help it to continue its programme of woodland expansion across the UK, providing free trees for communities and schools while creating new woodland sites free for people to enjoy and engage adults and children, and help to keep our woods free for people to enjoy. “We can’t achieve the levels of woodland creation and protection to fight back against climate change and tackle nature decline on our own,” said Darren Moorcroft, the Woodland Trust chief executive. “We want to continue to create havens for wildlife by planting millions of trees every year, campaign for new laws to protect ancient woodland and restore damaged ancient woods so they can breathe again and be safe for the public to enjoy for years to come. “Together we can achieve it and we are delighted that the Guardian has chosen us to be one of the Christmas appeal partners.” Please donate to our appeal here"

===================================
Chainsaws rip birdlife protection
The German Wildlife Foundation sees an increase in criminal activity in the construction of wind parks


Bird killed by wind turbine. Photo: German Wildlife Foundation
As delegates congregated in Paris, chainsaws were busily cutting down forests in Germany to make way for wind turbines. Protected trees which are homes to bird-life were being illegally cut down and birds killed.
Research by the German Wildlife Foundation, the Nature Protection Alliance (NABU) and the Committee Against Killing Birds have confirmed such criminal acts. So far at least 40 cases of illegal devastations to large birds within the scope of planned wind parks have been registered. In most cases the nests were destroyed or the trees cut down. At least in one case young birds were struck dead. The most common victim by far is the Red Kite. But also the extremely rare Lesser Spotted Eagle saw nests destroyed.
“These are not just random acts of recklessness by young rowdies, but rather criminal acts against protected species which can be punished with up to five years imprisonment,” says Prof. Dr. Fritz Vahrenholt, sole Chairman of the German Wildlife Federation. “The killing and destruction of nests represent a whole new dimension in the endangerment of species by wind park facilities,” says Prof. Vahrenholt. “Biodiversity and species protection are being callously sacrificed under the guise of wind energy and climate protection.”

Unscrupulous green energy dealmakers
Such criminal acts have been registered in 10 German states already and scrupulous green energy dealmakers are doing it with chainsaws. The current minimum distance regulations in most cases would forbid the construction of wind power facilities. But the value of property on which a wind park is built increases enormously in value overnight with the use of chainsaws: For each wind turbine the property owner can expect to earn €1.6 million in leasing fees – i.e. € 80,000 per year, for 20 years.
The research results presented by the environmentalists shows a frightening trend: Two years ago two cases were reported, in 2014 there were ten cases, and this year through November there have been 19 cases of nest destruction and bird killing nationwide. In addition to the Red Kites and the Lesser Spotted Eagle, also other species such as sea eagles, black storches, tree hawks and bats have been impacted.
Charges have been lodged in all cases. The German Wildlife Foundation anticipates more charges over the coming months because trees are cut down mostly during the winter months. “Also the construction of wind energy continues unhindered, and for this reason we fear a new wave of nest destruction,” says Prof. Vahrenholt. The German Wildlife Foundation reiterates its demand for a moratorium on wind turbines in forests.
Anyone who witnesses such an incident is asked to document it, press charges and to inform the Wildlife Foundation. More here

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe web media have been reporting on how a group of activist attorneys general have recently launched efforts to clamp down on climate science dissent.
The science-dissent crackdown is spearheaded by 16 Democrat attorneys general and US Justice Department head Loretta Lynch, who is falling back in part on the powerful federal RICO (anti-racketeering) laws. Their aim is to go after those who allegedly are operating a “climate denial scheme”, alleging that the dissent is defrauding the public.
Just a days ago the Washington Times published an article here questioning the government “crackdown” on the skeptics of the alarmist government-sanctioned science amid the large growing body of science that now refutes alarmist science, all published over the past two years. Here the Washington Times cited NoTricksZone, thanks to the diligent work of guest author Kenneth Richard.
In the report the WT quoted meteorologist Anthony Watts, owner and operator of the world’s most viewed site on climate science, WhatsUpWithThat. Watts acknowledged the growing number of skeptical publications, and implied that the grounds for alarmism and consensus have become more disputed and shaky than ever. “There has been quite an uptick in papers that question the consensus this year,” Watts told the WT. He referred to the Virgin Islands investigation as “climate McCarthyism”.
The US-based Competitive Enterprise Institute libertarian think tank, a target of the investigation called the subpoena against it “the latest effort in an intimidation campaign to criminalize speech and research on the climate debate.”
The WT also cites Bloomberg columnist Megan McArdle who criticized the legal move against climate science dissent, noting that climate activists have an unfortunate tendency of “trying to brand dissenters as the equivalent of Holocaust deniers.”
Skeptics and non-skeptics alike accuse the attorneys general of spreading an atmosphere of intimidation, one that is totally foreign to free and open societies where the exchange of ideas is normally welcome and not met with hostility.
“Fraud” investigation may end up reversing
As of March 27, already 133 consensus-skeptical papers have already been published this year, bringing to 660 the number of such studies appearing since January 2014.

Guest writer Richard also recently communicated that his digging into the literature is now revealing that the climate activists had also deceived the public on another climate issue. He expects to present his findings within a few weeks and noted they may be “something really big”.
And as the newly published science surfaces, a clear picture is emerging. It is becoming clearer that the notion of a “consensus-backed settled science” is in fact an illusion and the scheme behind that illusion soon may need to be investigated itself.
Tide gauge measurements rising only 1.4 mm per year
Another illusion surrounds sea level rise. Recently this site presented a number of papers and data sources involving, real, observed tide gauge measurements which in fact show sea levels are rising at rates well less than half the claimed rates.
On the world’s 225 long-term tide gauges, according to Dave Burton of SeaLevel.info site here:
197 of 225 stations (87.6%) have recorded less than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise. At 47 of 225 stations (20.9%) sea level is falling rather than rising. Just 28 of 225 stations (12.4%) have recorded more than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise.
The average SLR at those 225 gauges is +0.90 mm/yr. The median is +1.41 mm/yr.”
Strange how sea level rise “acceleration” happens to be absent along the coastlines, where it really matters.
There are many other instances, and it cannot be surprising that people have become skeptical. It’s time stop the investigation of the “fraud” of the honest, and to start investigating the “truth” of the dishonest.

"It is a common dilemma for any hard-bitten politician faced with a hostile crowd: how best to make a sharp exit to avoid embarrassment? For one 63-year-old Tory councillor confronted with a less than receptive audience during a climate crisis debate the answer was to clamber over some bins and scale a fence.  Nancy Bikson was a last-minute replacement for the Conservative prospective MP Maria Caulfield, who was too “busy” to attend climate hustings for candidates in the key marginal seat of Lewes, East Sussex, at a school on Monday evening. Explaining that she was afforded little time to prepare for the event organised by local groups, including a branch of Extinction Rebellion, Bikson said she would not be sticking around for questions after making a short speech. She attracted groans from the crowd, with one man heckling her before she even began speaking, asking: “Why don’t you go now?” Bikson said she cared deeply about the environment and that she “did her bit” but concluded, to further groans: “It’s all about us, there is no such thing as government. Government is just people.” Though she eventually gained polite applause, Bikson left the stage after other candidates made speeches and the event was opened to questions from the audience. However, when she left via the fire escape she found herself outside in a dead end as the school gates were locked. Rather than trudging back through the packed hall to get out, she pondered her predicament for up to 45 minutes before opting to climb over the fence. Bikson’s great escape would have stayed secret were it not for a 13-year-old girl who saw the incident at Priory school. The teenager, who did not wish to be named, said: “I left about an hour early and about half an hour after she [Bikson] left the stage. I came outside and I was about to cycle off and she was behind the gate next to our school canteen which was locked and said, ‘excuse me, can you help me?’ She sounded quite desperate. I said the only way back out is through the auditorium and she said she didn’t want to go back through the auditorium because of everyone. She said ‘they all despise me … and they don’t want me to go back in there’.”  Explaining that she felt sorry for the stranded politician, the teenager added: “I went back into the canteen to try and open the door from the inside [allowing her a route of escape] but it was locked. Then I got a caretaker. I said a caretaker is coming but she said, ‘don’t worry, I’ll just climb over the gate’. And she got up on the school bins and climbed over the gate. She’d been out there for a while.” After hearing the tale, the schoolgirl’s mother, who runs a business managing composers, brought the councillor’s ordeal to a wider audience, posting on Facebook: “Lewes Tory MP Maria Caulfield failed to show for tonight’s climate hustings. Her last-minute replacement left the hall before the questions, having first explained that she knew nothing about climate or the environment. “She was spotted by my daughter 45 minutes later still trying to find her way off the premises without having to go back through the hall. She ended up climbing the fence via the bins. Ignominious.” Bikson apparently admitted her actions later, telling the Evening Standard on Tuesday “It was only because there wasn’t any other way and I didn’t want to disrupt everybody. It was either that or sit outside for a couple of hours.” But when the Guardian rang to get her version of events she was tight-lipped, replying: “I can neither confirm nor deny, thank you.” Lewes was previously held by the former Liberal Democrat minister Norman Baker for nearly two decades before being won by Brexiter Caufield in 2015. But the Conservatives only have a majority of just over 5,000, meaning the constituency, which narrowly voted remain during the EU referendum, is a top target for the Lib Dems. "
"In the memorable second instalment of Blue Planet II, we are offered glimpses of an unfamiliar world – the deep ocean. The episode places an unusual emphasis on its own construction: glimpses of the deep sea and its inhabitants are interspersed with shots of the technology – a manned submersible – that brought us these astonishing images. It is very unusual and extremely challenging, we are given to understand, for a human to enter and interact with this unfamiliar world. The most watched programme of 2017 in the UK, Blue Planet II provides the opportunity to revisit questions that have long occupied us. To whom does the sea belong? Should humans enter its depths? These questions are perhaps especially urgent today, when Nautilus Minerals, a mining company registered in Vancouver, has been granted a license to extract gold and copper from the seafloor off the coast of Papua New Guinea. Though the company has suffered some setbacks, mining is still scheduled to begin in 2019. This marks a new era in our interaction with the oceans. For a long time in Western culture, to go to sea at all was to transgress. In Seneca’s Medea, the chorus blames advances in navigation for having brought the Golden Age to an end, while for more than one Mediterranean culture to travel through the Straits of Gibraltar and into the wide Atlantic was considered unwisely to tempt divine forces. The vast seas were associated with knowledge that humankind was better off without – another version, if you will, of the apple in the garden. If to travel horizontally across the sea was to trespass, then to travel vertically into its depths was to redouble the indiscretion. In his 17th-century poem Vanitie (I), George Herbert writes of a diver seeking out a “pearl” which “God did hide | On purpose from the ventrous wretch”.  In Herbert’s imagination, the deep sea is off limits, containing tempting objects whose attainment will damage us. Something like this vision of the deep resurfaces more than 300 years later in one of the most startling passages of Thomas Mann’s novel Doctor Faustus (1947), as a trip underwater in a diving bell figures forth the protagonist’s desire for occult, ungodly knowledge. Mann’s deep sea is a symbolic space, but his reference to a diving bell gestures towards the technological advances that have taken humans and their tools into the material deep. Our whale-lines and fathom-lines have long groped into the oceans’ dark reaches, while more recently deep-sea cables, submarines and offshore rigs have penetrated their secrets. Somewhat paradoxically, it may be that our day-to-day involvement in the oceans means that they no longer sit so prominently on our cultural radar: we have demystified the deep, and stripped it of its imaginative power. But at the same time, technological advances in shipping and travel mean that our culture is one of “sea-blindness”: even while writing by the light provided by oil extracted from the ocean floor, using communications provided by deep-sea cables, or arguing over the renewal of Trident, we perhaps struggle to believe that we, as humans, are linked to the oceans and their black depths. This wine bottle, found lying on the sea bed in the remote Atlantic, is to most of us an uncanny object: a familiar entity in an alien world, it combines the homely with the unhomely. For this reason, the activities planned by Nautilus Minerals have the whiff of science fiction. The company’s very name recalls that of the underwater craft of Jules Verne’s adventure novel Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas (1870), perhaps the most famous literary text set in the deep oceans.  But mining the deep is no longer a fantasy, and its practice is potentially devastating. As the Deep Sea Mining Campaign points out, the mineral deposits targeted by Nautilus gather around hydrothermal vents, the astonishing structures which featured heavily in the second episode of Blue Planet II. These vents support unique ecosystems which, if the mining goes ahead, are likely to be destroyed before we even begin to understand them. (Notice the total lack of aquatic life in Nautilus’s corporate video: they might as well be drilling on the moon.) The campaigners against deep sea mining also insist – sounding not unlike George Herbert – that we don’t need the minerals located at the bottom of the sea: that the reasons for wrenching them from the deep are at best suspect. So should we be leaving the deep sea well alone? Sadly, it is rather too late for that. Our underwater cameras transmit images of tangled fishing gear, cables and bottles strewn on the seafloor, and we find specimens of deep sea animals thousands of metres deep and hundreds of kilometres away from land with plastic fibres in their guts and skeletons.  It seems almost inevitable that deep sea mining will open a new and substantial chapter on humanity’s relationship with the oceans. Mining new resources is still perceived to be more economically viable than recycling; as natural resources become scarcer, the ocean bed will almost certainly become of interest to global corporations with the capacity to explore and mine it – and to governments that stand to benefit from these activities. These governments are also likely to compete with one another for ownership of parts of the global ocean currently in dispute, such as the South China Sea and the Arctic. The question is perhaps not if the deep sea will be exploited, but how and by whom. So what is to be done?  Rather than declaring the deep sea off-limits, we think our best course of action is to regain our fascination with it. We may have a toe-hold within the oceans; but, as any marine scientist will tell you, the deep still harbours unimaginable secrets. The onus is on both scientists and those working in what has been dubbed the “blue humanities” to translate, to a wider public, the sense of excitement to be found in exploring this element. Then, perhaps, we can prevent the deep ocean from becoming yet another commodity to be mined – or, at least, we can ensure that such mining is responsible and that it takes place under proper scrutiny. The sea, and especially the deep sea, will never be “ours” in the way that tracts of land become cities, or even in the way rivers become avenues of commerce. This is one of its great attractions, and is why it is so easy to sit back and view the deep sea with awed detachment when watching Blue Planet II. But we cannot afford to pretend that it lies entirely beyond our sphere of activity. Only by expressing our humility before it, perhaps, can we save it from ruthless exploitation; only by acknowledging and celebrating our ignorance of it can we protect it from the devastation that our technological advances have made possible."

Share this...FacebookTwitterMike Shellenberger, President of Environmental Progress and Time Magazine ‘Hero of the Environment’, appeared dismayed when he tweeted here that Germany CO2 emissions rose over 1% in 2015, as the following chart shows:

Graph by Clean Energy Wire, data from German Environment Agency (UBA) and Green Budget Germany. More here. 
In 2015 Germany’s Co2 emissions rose to 912 million tonnes, up from 902 million tonnes from a year earlier and from 906 million tonnes way back in 2009. Overall Germany’s CO2 emissions savings have trended slightly upwards over the past 7 years.
Megan Darby at Climate Home here calls the development “a blow to the country’s claims to climate leadership“.
Schellenberger has every reason to be shocked by the 2015 result.
1. 2015 was Germany’s second warmest year on record, meaning fuel consumed for heating had to have been low.
2. Germany has invested tens of billions of euros in its bid to switch to CO2-free energy sources. Angela Merkel top aide Peter Altmaier warned that the Energiewende would cost 1 trillion euros.
3. Consumers, who were  once into thinking it wasn’t going to cost much, are now paying close to the highest electricity prices worldwide. One kilowatt-hour costing close to €30 cents. Hundreds of thousands of households are having their power cut off because they can no longer afford to pay their power bills.

4. Germany power grid is now more unstable than it has been in decades. That fact in combination with the high electricity prices is driving industry out.
5. Germany’s per capita CO2 emissions are among the highest in the world.
6. About half of Germany’s CO2 reductions since 1990 resulted from the shut-down of former communist East Germany’s inefficient state-run industry.
7. Wind parks have blighted much of the country’s idyllic landscape and thousands of people are now suffering from health damage due to infrasound. Planned windparks are facing increasingly ferocious protests from nature protection and citizens groups.
8. 2016 will likely also see no reductions – thanks to the low petroleum prices and colder weather so far.
Socialism and energy!
In summary Germany’s Energiewende has been an extremely costly government-intervention debacle of monumental dimensions. We haven’t seen such a large-scale industrial mismanagement since the collapse of the USSR and the German Democratic Republic. Recall that not only did their industry collapse into a heap of rubble, but they too also left huge environmental damage that we are still cleaning up 25 years later.
And no one in his/her right mind expects Germany to meet its 2020 target, let alone 2030. Other countries have to be insane (or have lots of money to burn) to follow the German example.

Share this...FacebookTwitterChallenged: 3.2 mm/year sea level rise since 1993
By guest author Kenneth Richard
Source data studies indicate recent only 0.8 – 1.6 mm/year sea level rise.
According to the IPCC (2013), sea levels rose at a rate of 1.7 mm/year (6.7 inches per century) for the 1901 to 2010 period, but 3.2 mm/year (12.6 inches per century) during the 18-year period between 1993 to 2010, a rate similar to that obtained from 1920 to 1950.
If sea levels truly were rising at rates of 3.2 mm/year between 1993 and 2010 as the IPCC (2013) claims with high confidence, then the thermal and ablation sources for that sea level rise should at least somewhat closely add up to 3.2 mm/year for the same period.  But if the sources for the sea level rise as determined by published studies only reach between 0.8 and 1.6 mm/year when added together – a quarter to half of the 3.2 mm/year claimed – then that suggests that there is something seriously questionable about the 3.2 mm/year sea level rise estimates for 1993 to 2010 obtained by satellite altimetry.
What follows is an abridged list of recent papers showing that sea level rise estimations claimed by the IPCC are likely highly exaggerated.

“It is very likely that the global mean rate was 1.7 mm yr–1 between 1901 and 2010 for a total sea level rise of 0.19 m. Between 1993 and 2010, the rate was very likely higher at 3.2 mm yr–1; similarly high rates likely occurred between 1920 and 1950.”
—
Problematically, in recent decades the source contribution estimates for recent decades from published studies add up to half (or less) of this claimed rate.
According to recent estimates, the contribution to sea level rise from thermal expansion was 0.64 mm/yr (2.5 inches per century) for the period between 2005-2013 (Llovel et al., 2014, see below). The contribution from the Greenland (GIS) and Antarctic (AIS) ice sheets was 0.59 mm/yr (2.3 inches per century) for the 1992-2011 period (Shepherd et al., 2012).  The contribution from global glaciers and ice caps that are not the GIS or AIS was 0.41 mm/yr (1.6 inches per century) for 2003-2010 (Jacob et al., 2012).

Over the entire water column, independent estimates of ocean warming yield a contribution of 0.77 ± 0.28 mm yr−1 in sea-level rise … the deep ocean (below 2,000 m) contributes −0.13 ± 0.72 mm yr−1 to global sea-level rise [0.64 mm/yr total].

Since 1992, the polar ice sheets [Antarctica and Greenland] have contributed, on average, 0.59 ± 0.20 millimeter year−1 to the rate of global sea-level rise.

Here we show that GICs [glaciers and ice caps], excluding the Greenland and Antarctic peripheral GICs, lost mass at a rate of 148 ± 30 Gt yr−1 from January 2003 to December 2010, contributing 0.41 ± 0.08 mm yr−1 to sea level rise.
—
These sources add up to about 1.6 mm/year, which is the equivalent of a little over 6 inches per century.  Interestingly, this is the same or slightly less than the rate for the entire 1901 to 2010 period (1.7 mm/year, IPCC), meaning that sea level rise has not accelerated in recent decades according to the summation of source estimates.
Another recent estimate of the sea level contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet (Zwally et al., 2015, see below) for 1992-2008 has East Antarctica ice mass gains exceeding the losses from West Antarctica, indicating a net gain in ice mass for the continent as a whole and a negative sea level contribution of -0.23 mm/year (-0.9 of an inch per century) for 2003 to 2008.

Mass changes of the Antarctic ice sheet impact sea-level rise as climate changes, but recent rates have been uncertain. Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data (2003–08) show mass gains from snow accumulation exceeded discharge losses by 82 ± 25 Gt a–1, reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm a–1. European Remote-sensing Satellite (ERS) data (1992–2001) give a similar gain of 112 ± 61 Gt a–1.

“The good news is that Antarctica is not currently contributing to sea level rise, but is taking 0.23 millimeters per year away,” Zwally said.
—
Along with the sea level decline equivalent of -0.23 mm/year for 2003-2008 due to ice gains of +82 Gt per year between 2003 and 2008, we can compute the sea level loss equivalent for 1992-2001 as -0.31 mm/yr, as 1992-2001 had a higher rate of mass gain (+112 Gt/year) for the Antarctic ice sheet as a whole.  Averaged together, the Zwally et al. (2015) study indicates that Antarctica took away -0.28 mm/yr (-1.1 inches) from sea levels over 1992-2008.
Using this -0.28 mm/year estimate for Antarctica’s ice melt contribution instead of the Shepherd et al. (2012) estimate of 0.19 mm/year (0.7 of an inch per century), but yet continuing to use the Shepherd et al. (2012) estimate for Greenland’s ice sheet contribution (0.4 mm/year) reduces the polar ice sheet contribution from 0.59 mm/year to 0.12 mm/year, which is a sea level contribution of half an inch (0.5) per century from both polar ice sheets combined.
This change of -0.47 mm/year effectively reduces the 1.6 mm/year source estimate from above to between 1.1 and 1.2 mm/year, a little over 4 inches per century.
The template for the above source analysis of sea level rise contributions was provided in the journal Science  by Cabanes et al., 2001.  Here is their summary for the last few decades of the 20th century.

http://people.uncw.edu/grindlayn/GLY550/sealevel-topex-science-2001.pdf
The third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates the various factors that have contributed to the 20th century sea level rise. The largest contribution (0.7 mm/year sea level rise) arises from thermal expansion due to warming of the oceans that mainly occurred since the 1950s. Melting of continental glaciers produces 0.2 to 0.4 mm/year sea level rise. Estimated Greenland and Antarctica mass imbalance (accounting for a long-term readjustment since Last Glacial Maximum plus a climate-related response) contributes –0.2 to 0.6 mm/year. The least certain contribution is the change in terrestrial water storage that results partly from human activities, which is in the range of –1.1 to + 0.4 mm/year with a median value of −0.35 mm/year (i.e., corresponding to sea level drop). The sum of these contributions ranges from −0.8 to 2.2 mm/year, with a median value of 0.7 mm/year.
—
Notice that in this analysis, “terrestrial water storage” is included in the contribution budget, and this amounted to -0.35 mm/year (with a range of “–1.1 to + 0.4 mm/year”)  for the late 20th century.  A more recent estimate is apparently not available, but it is likely a fair assumption that these parameters for terrestrial water storage haven’t changed significantly during the first decade of the 21 century compared to the last decades of the 20th.  Therefore, it would be reasonable to include this value among the source contributions to recent sea level rise.  This would effectively reduce the 1.1 to 1.2 mm/year rate described above (using Zwally et al., 2015) to about 0.8 mm/year, which is very similar to the 0.7 mm/year calculated for the last decades of the 20th century by Cabanes et al., 2001.  A rate of 0.8 mm/year is equivalent to about 3 inches per century.

Share this...FacebookTwitterThe legal winds are shifting! Many city councils and wind park planners are going to have to clean up their acts when pushing through their pet wind park projects.
Germany’s Fundamental Law specifically expresses that the State is obligated to protect the life and physical body of the individual, foremost from illegal attacks by others.
Consequently, according to German legal experts Prof. Michael Elicker and Andreas Langenbahn here, city councils approving the installation of wind parks may be held personally liable for damage to the health of persons who live close to them.
And when it comes to wind parks, even if only a certain part of the population are susceptible to the health hazards of infrasound (frequency below 20 Hz), it does not preclude the requirement being complied with. They write (my emphasis):
If the state (in this sense the term also includes the towns and communities) allows large wind parks to be constructed at a completely inadequate distance – at times only a few hundred meters – then it violates the state obligation to protect and may be held liable for the health consequences.
With this backdrop there are large risks also for communities and their participants if during the planning of so-called “wind-park priority areas” they willingly follow along with the ‘considerations of the contracted planning companies, of whom most of them belong to – and the term is indeed appropriate – the ecological-industrial complex.”
In Germany this puts city councils who onesidedly base their decisions to build wind parks on dubious planning/approval processes and feasibility studies squarely in the legal line of fire.

Too often windpark approvals are fraught with conflicts of interest and crony deals. Finally in Germany the spotlight is getting aimed at the dark underside of the renewable energy industry and their tactics used in ramming projects through against the will of the people.
Also city councils and wind park planers are finding it increasingly difficult to dismiss infrasound produced by wind turbines by claiming that “it cannot be proven scientifically”.
Experts Elicker and Langenbahn calls claims there is no scientific evidence supporting the health hazards of infrasound “false” and that the State is in any case obligated to protect life and body of persons not only after a hazard is conclusively proven.
The authors of the report write that it is extremely difficult to dampen the very low frequency infrasound and that it can travel for kilometers, noting that contrary to wide-spread belief, the frequency is audible, and that it is perceived as pulsations and vibrations.
Even Germany’s Ministry of Environment writes, summing the results of investigations and contradicting earlier claims, that starting at a certain acoustic level, infrasound can have a variety of negative effects on the human body and can interfere with the cardio-vascular system, adversely effect concentration, reaction time, balance and the nervous system. Victims often complain of dizziness.
Elicker and Langenbahn believe that many councilmen and planners have been too careless in their dismissal of infrasound when planning their wind parks. They write that this could all lead to a “rude awakening” for those involved in the slipshod approval of wind parks, and warn they may even be personally liable with their own private assets.
High time.

By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P. Gosselin)
It’s the end of the year tally at the DWD German Weather Service for 2015. In a press release the DWD reported on December 30, 2015:

2015 second warmest year in Germany – tied with 2000 and 2007
2015 in Germany saw a mean temperature of 9.9°C, thus – after the preliminary analysis of measurements taken from some 2000 surface stations belonging to the DWD – it is the second warmest year on record since measurements began in 1881, tied with 2000 and 2007. The temperature record of 2014 stands by a wide margin at 10.3°C. Moreover the past 12 months were also drier and sunnier than normal, the DWD reports.
In 2015, 10 of 12 months were warmer than normal. Only September and October came in below the multi-year mean. August was the second warmest and November and December were even the record warmest ever since 1881. In July and August extreme heat dominated Germany, and the Franconian town of Kitzingen measured 40.3 °C , setting a new Germany record high.”

What a disappointment. We were already looking forward to a new annual record – and then came the blow. Only the silver medal, and that shared with two other years. Theoretically 2015 got only one third of a silver medal.
Back on September 21, 2015, German public television ntv held out hope:
According to scientists 2015 could be the warmest year on record worldwide since measurements began 135 years ago. Also Germany could break a record. So far in the country 2014 has been the warmest, said the chairperson of the German meteorological Society (DMG), Gudrun Rosenhagen at the 10th German Climate Conference in Hamburg. And this year is well on the way to break the record.”
What a pity, Frau Rosenhagen. By the way we are still waiting for an answer to our question sent to the DMG (see “Answer requested: Is the solar trend in the statement released by the German Meteorological Society correct?“). In its press release the DWD claims that in 2015 ten of twelve months were warmer than the mean. We assume this is in comparison to the now obsolete and ancient 1961 to 1990 reference period. When using the more up-to-date 1981 to 2010 reference period, the number of warmer than normal months likely drops.
It also remains a mystery how Germany’s year 2000 managed to reach 2nd place. It was a rained out summer and public swimming pools saw very few swimmers. [The following video shows ARD television asking whatever had happened to the summer amid cold rainy weather]:

Thanks to Klima Manifest Heiligenroth
The DWD forgets to mention that over the past 15 years there has been no warming whatsoever. What follows are a number monthly mean temperature plots going back over the recent past. For whatever reason, what the DWD refuses to make public, is made public thanks to Josef Kowatsch. What follows are three examples of the development of monthly mean temperatures in Germany – based on the DWD’s own original data.

July Germany mean temperature plot since 2000:

October mean temperature plot, last 16 years:

No global record
Also the global temperature failed to set a new record in 2015. The UAH measured figures show an extended global temperature pause. 2015 came in only in third place, as NASA satellite expert Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama in Huntsville documents here.
This makes 2015 the third warmest year globally (+0.27°C) in the satellite record (since 1979), well behind 1998 (+0.48 deg C) and 2010 (+0.34 deg. C).
That’s quite lousy for an El Niño year, which in mid 2015 the year was regarded as a candidate for a world record. Somehow the wind behind 2015 must have disappeared in the second half.

Temperature trend as to satellite measurements. Figure: Roy Spencer, UAH.
Moreover surface station datasets GISS and HadCRUT are in crisis. Over the past years they have interfered multiple times with the datasets and carried out a number of highly dubious corrections that make little sense. The data are now highly questionable, and alleged records are suspicious. Here there has to be and there will be consequences.

"On November 6 1217, Henry III’s Charter of the Forest gave ordinary English people back their traditional rights to use royal hunting grounds for livestock grazing and collecting firewood. The freedoms that were restored in the use of ancient woodland reshaped the community’s legal and political relationship with nature. But, today, this relationship has broken down. Only 2% of the UK’s ancient woodland survives; over half has been destroyed since the 1930s. Only 13% of the UK is covered with trees, compared to the European average of 37%. And so exactly 800 years on, in Lincoln Castle, home of the original charter, a new Charter for Trees, Woods and People has been launched by the Woodland Trust.  The purpose of the new charter is to set out “the principles by which trees and people in the UK can stand together”. In the face of problems such as low planting rates, inconsistent management, threats from housing and infrastructure developments, the desire is to “build a people-powered movement for trees” and to “demonstrate the important role that trees play in people’s lives”. The principles of the charter include the protection of irreplaceable trees and woods, the creation of transport networks for wildlife, the strengthening of habitats with trees and the development of an action plan to harness their health benefits. Its purpose is to serve as a unified “rallying cry” for disparate voices and organisations, and so to bring the plight of trees and woodlands to national consciousness, in a particularly cogent way.  So why is such a charter needed? Writing as a philosopher, and reflecting on the history of my subject, it does give pause for thought: trees, and plants generally, have simply not garnered attention in the way that humans, and more recently, non-human animals have. It’s as if Socrates’ remark that “the trees teach me nothing” is very much still the attitude today.  Yet nothing could be further from the truth. Exciting work in botany is revealing the extraordinary capacities of plants: for memory, for communication, for tracking environmental features and even – perhaps – for discrimination between self and non-self. Any philosopher interested in the intelligence or psychological capacities of animals, human or otherwise, needs to be able to situate their work in relation to these newly discovered capacities. Take the complex, often vast, symbiotic relation between common fungi and the roots of forest trees, dubbed the “wood wide web”. Here, organisms have formed a mutually beneficial connection for the purpose of exchanging nutrients or even, in the case of trees, distributing resources. If we want to know about the nature of intelligence, or what a species is, or whether an entity such as a forest is a super-organism, attending to the lives of trees can teach us a lot. To be fair to Socrates, when he says that “only the people in the city” can teach him, what he means is that it is only by speaking to and interacting with others, within the walls of the city-state, that we can learn how to be good. But, again, he’s wrong. We live among trees and how we interact with them, as well as the degree of our sensitivity to them, has moral significance.  Imagine a person gleefully beheading wildflowers by the roadside or cutting down an oak in their garden for the sheer pleasure of it. Many of us would that say these actions are wrong. Why? It’s not as if another person has been harmed because their property rights have been violated. If we assume that trees lack sentience, then it isn’t right to say that the actions are cruel, because cruelty presupposes a being that can suffer.  Kant condemns the wilful destruction of nature because he thinks such actions inculcate bad habits. He argues that we have an indirect duty to treat animals well, for example, because a person who is cruel to animals will often end up being cruel to human beings, to whom we owe direct duties. Likewise, we have indirect duties to inanimate nature – Kant lumps together beautiful crystal formations with the beauty of plants – because respecting their intrinsic, aesthetic value helps instils in us the habit to treat each other well. So, although Kant does deal with humanity’s relationship with nature, he only does so in terms of how this relationship benefits human beings and their social interactions.   So what is the dominant philosophical conception of nature now?  The new charter appears largely to reflect this Kantian approach to nature, at least in broad terms. It draws our attention, rightly, to all the benefits of trees in our lives and in the lives of other sentient creatures: habitats resilient to climate change, opportunities for education, cultural enrichment, health benefits, the list goes on.  The danger is that this human-centric approach slides inexorably into an increasingly popular natural capital mode of valuation, in which trees and woodlands are conceived first and foremost as “assets” that provide vital “ecosystem services”. It is this language, borrowed from economics, that, for example, frames the Independent Panel of Forestry report, published in 2011 to advise the government on the future direction of forestry and woodland policy in England. The philosopher in me would like to point out that we ought to value trees for their own sake and not simply for the benefits or “services” they provide to human beings (or another forms of sentient life). However, in a time of environmental devastation, any reason to protect trees and woodlands is a good reason. In any case, the two are not mutually exclusive. We can, without contradiction, value nature for its own sake and also for the sake of its benefits.  But there is, perhaps, a special role for philosophers in banging on about the former, even as we need the latter approach to get government to listen. It used to be thought that the only thing that mattered morally was a capacity to reason. Then, in the 19th century, the British utilitarians showed that an animal’s capacity to suffer meant that we also owed the animals moral consideration. Now, it seems, the sheer fact that a thing is alive is of moral importance.  It may be that value attaches to an organism’s ability to develop all of its natural, biological capacities, as biocentrists think. Or it may be that we attach value to entities that display certain kinds of animate, bodily movement, as I have argued. In any case, trees are special, wonderful organisms and the Charter for Trees, Woods and People does a great service in drawing their silent, mysterious lives to our attention."
"More than 95% of people still eat meat and don’t like being told that it is wrong and bad for the planet to do so. But it is now well established that meat production is responsible for a substantial proportion of human greenhouse gas emissions, not to mention issues around animal welfare. Perhaps more worrying is the increasing problem of massive food wastage. However, people can significantly address these challenges – and an impending “burger apocalypse” – by following a few simple steps toward low carbon eating. Switching to a low carbon diet has three major benefits: it reduces your impact on the environment, it saves you money, and it’s very likely to be healthier for you. So what’s all this talk of a burger apocalypse, then? The fact is the now common choice to “grab a burger” is a significant part of human-caused climate change. Food accounts for up to 30% of greenhouse gas emissions and – gram for gram – beef is the highest carbon food. Mass producing beef comes with all sorts of unintended consequences. Animal welfare is a long running issue and there have been numerous cases of cruelty uncovered over the years. Excessive red meat contributes to disease and obesity, and the huge amount of land needed for cattle farming could be used much more efficiently to produce other foods. As a result, the whole planet suffers. For cows, like lambs, produce methane – a greenhouse gas 34 times as potent as CO₂. Cows need huge amounts more water than other foods and are the leading cause of deforestation, reducing how much CO₂ can be absorbed instead of going into the atmosphere. The World Resources Institute says that compared to 2006, global demand for beef is projected to increase by 95% by 2050. Government and business have to play their part, but rather than absolving themselves of responsibility by laying blame on others, individuals can make simple changes to their diet and cut tonnes off their annual carbon footprint. People are quick to blame the supermarkets for food waste, but in developed countries much more is wasted in the home than along the whole of the supply chain. The amount of food we throw away is so staggeringly high the numbers become meaningless to most people. You could think of it this way: 28% of our agricultural land and a big proportion of our precious fresh water is used to grow food that never reaches a human stomach. The best way to reduce your food waste is to plan your meals before going to the supermarket, so you only buy what you will use. People get preoccupied with whether food is local. But whether it’s in-season is more important for it’s carbon footprint. In his book How Bad Are Bananas?, Mike Berners-Lee tells us bananas bought in the UK are low carbon as they come from central or south America by boat. Conversely, you might get UK-grown strawberries in the winter, but they’ll be grown in a hot-house, using fossil-fuel energy, so they could be responsible for 12 times the amount of carbon than between May to September when they’re in season. With global trade and supermarkets selling most foods year-round it can be hard to know when fruits and vegetables are in-season. You can check this seasonality chart before making the trip to the supermarket. Note on the chart, asparagus, when bought outside the UK’s short growing season of April to June, is responsible for is around 30 times higher carbon as it has to be air-freighted from Peru. Even people who don’t want to reduce how much meat they eat can switch from beef or lamb to pork or chicken and cut around two-thirds off the associated carbon footprint. Vegetarians need to be careful here too. Cheddar cheese is high carbon so maybe have small portions and consider soft cheeses, which need a lot less milk. Low carbon meat substitutes in supermarkets have exploded in the last couple of years and restaurants are catching up, with most now providing at least one or two meat-free options. The Impossible Burger, which launched in the US last year after five years of research, is aimed at meat lovers. Yet it’s a plant-based burger. The “magic ingredient” is heme, which is what makes meat “meaty”. But you can get it from plants as well as animals. It has an eighth the greenhouse gas emissions as a beef burger but it smells, sizzles, and, apparently, tastes like beef.  Meat-eaters and burger lovers are trying it and giving it positive reviews. It might just persuade people to switch. How something tastes is a bigger factor for the average person than the ethical or environmental argument.  Another way to reduce your food’s impact on you and the earth is eat less – especially protein. As the World Resources Institute points out, people now consume far more than the recommended 50 grams of protein a day, especially in wealthy countries. This excess protein is often the expensive, unhealthy, high carbon kind. An astounding 2.2 billion people – almost one in three – are now overweight or obese. So how can you do your bit to fight The Burger Apocalypse? By following the ABC of low carbon eating: Avoid wasting food, Buy in-season food, and Choose low carbon food more."

The Belgian online Le Peuple here interviewed István Marko, Professor of Chemistry at the UCL, and a so-called climate non-alarmist, on what he thought of the results of the highly ballyhooed Paris COP21 climate summit and agreement.
Photo: www.uclouvain.be
Unrealistic and laughable
His assessment is devastating. He calls the COP21 agreement a “grand illusion“, a “resounding failure” and one of “wishful thinking” on the part of the rich countries. He calls the 2.0°C warming target “unrealistic” – never mind the 1.5°C warming target, which in the interview he called “laughable“.
No enforcement mechanisms
Markó calls the COP21 agreement an “obvious failure” because there is no mechanism forcing the signatory countries to do what they just ‘promise’. “Nothing is binding.”
Markó says the rich countries have engaged in “wishful thinking“.
When it comes to the $100 billion in annual payments to developing countries, “nothing in the 10 pages of the 31-page final report assures this is going to happen”.
Will it be loans or donations? Will there be an interest rate that will be applied? And if so, which? What happens in the event of of non-payment! There’s no organ of control”.
Markó says, “Nobody knows how the European countries are going to finance these amounts to be paid to poor countries”.
No CO2 emissions decrease
Markó also tells Le Peuple more on why the COP21 agreement is nothing short of a folly:

China can continue to emit CO2 without restriction up to 2030. These emissions would correspond to an increase of 140% over its 2005 emissions, and India 150% of its 2005 emissions. Other developing countries can emit CO2 as they see fit. No decrease in emissions!”
Text filled with “should” instead of “shall”
For Professor Markó it is indeed a mystery how any serious environmental organization holding the belief that man-made CO2 emissions are damaging global climate would be satisfied with such a powerless agreement, which we are now seeing as being nothing more than an illusion of a binding treaty. Come Christmastime when environmentalists unwrap the package, they will quickly realize they’ve been sold a fake.
Markó also finds it amazing that countries who endorse the agreement will be able to still withdraw after 3 years:
Yet once again, nothing is binding.” Remember that U.S. Secretary, John Kerry had announced before, that if there were the slightest binding commitment, the US Senate would refuse the agreement.
He adds that throughout the text conditionals were added everywhere: “should” instead of “shall“.
Schellnhuber’s delirium
On the 2°C target, Markó says it has “strictly no physical or scientific basis” and that it is “nothing serious“. It is a randomly picked number by Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, Director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, which Markó calls “the green lobby in Germany” and “a voice of the Church of climate alarmism“.
Markó reminds that not even Schellnhuber believes the alarmism he so gravely preaches, citing a Spiegel interview where “he had confessed that even if warming exceeds 2°C, humanity would not suffer”.
For him it is a symbolic figure, for political purpose. The message has been dramatized and 2°C has become the difference between the death of the planet and our very survival! Delirium.”
COP21 ends, realities return
At the end of the interview Markó summarizes that COP21 has no useful or serious results other than slowing growth in developed countries and rendering no benefit to developing countries. The only good Markó sees from COP21 is: “it is over and we finally can return to the realities.”

British environment minister Michael Gove has launched a 12-week consultation exercise on a policy which, if implemented, would also ban all ivory imports and exports to the country. There is much to celebrate about the government taking a lead on this issue. However, such bans can have unintended consequences. The US, for instance, is just over a year in to its own “near total” ivory ban after it amended its Endangered Species Act with a special rule for the African elephant. At a stroke it effectively outlawed domestic trade in elephant ivory, yet the ban has affected museums, musicians and even Arctic peoples. No wonder the US government’s own Fish and Wildlife Service needs to issue guidance on “What Can I Do With My Ivory?”. If the UK is to make its ban work, it should first look across the Atlantic for some valuable lessons. Museums contain lots of ivory items of historical or cultural significance, and the important role they play in public life makes the case for an exemption. I recently visited The Smithsonian in Washington DC to find out how it is dealing with the ban as its experience will be important for UK institutions with ivory items such as the British Museum, the Natural History Museum and the V&A.  The Smithsonian clearly does not condone or advocate illegal ivory trading, and its own National Museum of Natural History recently developed an excellent display on the negative effects of the ivory trade on elephants. Yet, as the public has turned against ivory, many museums are pondering whether, or how, to display these items. The Smithsonian has established an Ivory Task Force to think through these complex challenges. Ivory pieces for example, can be an important part of displays about historical injustices that we should not forget – one obvious example is the link between the slave trade and the trade in African elephant ivory. The newest member of the Smithsonian the National Museum of African American Hisotry and Culture, has a display which specifically tackles this.   The US ban also makes it harder for museums to share their collections internationally. Museums may be reluctant to loan out their ivory where strict domestic bans are in place, as there is a risk their collection will be impounded. While US regulations allow the import and re-export of worked ivory as part of a non-commercial travelling exhibition, the ivory must be proven to be “pre-convention” – that is, removed from the wild before global laws on wildlife trade came into force in 1976. However, the reality is that museums are likely to remain concerned that their collections will be at risk if they travel to the US.  The UK plans go even further, and propose a ban on all ivory, whether it is pre-convention or not. Ivory also pops up in unlikely places, and small bits of ivory can render a much larger item illegal. For example one of the chronometers which was aboard the HMS Beagle with Charles Darwin has an ivory disk on its case. This puts it off limits for US museums – in order to import it they would have to remove the ivory and replace it with another material, such as plastic. But if the disk is replaced, can we really still claim it is the same chronometer that voyaged with Darwin? Does it retain its historical significance? The US domestic ivory ban has also hit sales of carvings in narwhal and walrus ivory, which generate income for some native Arctic communities. Dealers in Arctic arts were facing more and more questions and criticism from customers who assumed the ivory was banned, such that it became less profitable and desirable to stock and sell items made from other forms of ivory. One group in Alaska, the Iñupiat, has called for greater clarity on the law. While the market for Arctic arts and carvings is less significant in the UK than in the US, it is worth thinking about how a British ban might compound this problem.  Art and antique dealers may also suddenly find sections of their stock are illegal to sell. This also affects musicians since many instruments have parts made from ivory. Piano keys are obvious, but there are also several traditional instruments that have ivory parts, including the Japanese lute-like Shamisen, antique European violin bows, and even many bagpipes. Under the US ban, instruments with ivory parts can only enter the country if the owner can prove that the ivory was taken from the wild before 1976 and can provide the correct musical instrument permit. This is not as easy as it sounds. The UK consultation refers to the need to develop specific and clearly defined exemptions to a domestic ivory ban. This is important. But as the global trade ban on endangered plants and animals has shown, the more exemptions there are, the more potential loopholes there are for traffickers to exploit; for instance, the trade in antique and reworked ivory has been used as a cover for illegal ivory. There are no easy answers, but learning from the US would be a very good place to start."
"Fundamental human rights are now recognised across much of the world. Humans, however, cannot exist without the natural world. So should we also award rights to environmental entities? The idea has gained traction in recent years – and it is rivers that have found themselves at the vanguard of landmark legal developments.  Rivers often have strong cultural and spiritual identities as sacred living entities or life-giving beings. These existential understandings have underpinned legal actions in New Zealand and India that have endowed rivers with rights that are comparable to their human counterparts.  It is a case in Colombia that is of particular interest to me as a river scientist and geographer, however. In May 2017, the country’s constitutional court awarded rights to the Atrato, a river that flows through the globally recognised “biodiversity hotspot” of Colombia’s north-western Pacific rainforest. This ruling is subtly different from the others because the legal arguments emphasise rationalism rather than existentialism. In Colombia, the Atrato River has been awarded rights because of what it provides for human life – not because it should be equated with human life. Its “bio-cultural” rights now include the river’s “protection, conservation, maintenance and restoration”. This places a significant burden on the Colombian state to ensure the rights are enforced – and it demands that local people are empowered to manage their river properly. Colombia’s political context, and its recent civil war, makes this particularly challenging. The Atrato is located in the Chocó Department – Colombia’s poorest and one of its most geographically isolated. Despite the 2016 peace agreement between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (the FARC), Chocó remains a stronghold for a range of paramilitary and anti-government militia groups who are yet to sue for peace.  Most prominently, this means the militias remain in control of the Atrato Basin’s rich deposits of “placer” gold (the gold deposited in river sediment). With the state unable to intervene, illegal mining of this sediment has accelerated unchecked over the past three decades with little effort to mitigate (or even monitor) its environmental impact. The Atrato’s new rights demand it must be protected and eventually restored. But in the absence of comprehensive baseline data, it is hard to know what this means let alone how it should best be achieved.  It is against this backdrop that I travelled to the Atrato Basin in August 2017 as part of a small expedition of researchers from British universities and the Chocó Technical University. We were accompanied by lawyers from Tierra Digna, the NGO responsible for advocating for the Atrato. Our objective was to identify how the river’s abstract rights could translate into concrete progress on the ground. Our focus was one of the Atrato’s major tributaries, the Rio Quito. Local testimony and recent analysis of satellite imagery indicated that more than 100km of the Quito’s river channel and floodplain had been almost completely destroyed in less than 20 years. The reality was sobering. River bank deforestation followed by large-scale mechanised mining has left several hundred square kilometres of mining waste along the Rio Quito. In some places the ground is heavily contaminated with mercury and plants are unable to reestablish.  Industrial dredgers and excavators have reshaped the river to the point that regular seasonal floods no longer occur, breaking the vital cycle of nutrients and carbon between river and floodplain. And, as a result, the Quito has become very turbid – destroying fish habitat, and affecting the quality of drinking water for people. Mining in the Atrato Basin has also displaced tens of thousands of Afro-Colombian and indigenous people from their land, and several community leaders who resisted have been injured or killed. Sexual violence experienced by displaced women is a particular problem, and communities have reported birth defects and skin lesions which may be linked to chemical exposure and mercury poisoning. The Atrato River in general, and Rio Quito in particular, serve as a stark reminder that awarding environmental rights is not the same as realising them. Such rights don’t exist within a vacuum, of course, and they will only be fulfilled if political, socio-economic and cultural systems support them. In the Atrato Basin, change could start with effective mapping and monitoring. We need to know where mining contaminants – in particular fine sediment and mercury – have come from and how much has been released. We also need to understand how gold mining fits into the political economy of conflict and violence in the Department of Chocó. Local communities must also be empowered to be participants in identifying sustainable solutions. The task is monumental, but if the Atrato River’s rights can be translated into effective action, the river and its communities have the potential to become archetypes for how human and bio-cultural rights together can help deliver sustainable futures."
"“Further, faster ambition together” is the mission statement of the global leaders attending the 23rd Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change (COP23) in Bonn. It has been met with a mixture of scepticism and urgency, particularly after the new raised projections for this year’s global carbon emissions suggested a peak has yet to be reached.  As part of the conference, cities and regions across the world are adopting the Bonn-Fiji Commitment on climate action. It aims to remove up to 1.3 billion tons of CO₂ equivalent per year by curbing emissions at the local level. The system being put in place to deliver the commitment does appear impressive, but look more carefully and it seems to see sustainable cities in very much the same way as usual: primarily cutting emissions from heat and transport and by installing more renewable energy.  This is all essential but it misses an important part of the picture. My main area of interest is the sustainability of buildings, a key component of reducing city emissions. For years, policies and regulations have focused on reducing the energy demands of buildings while we live, shop and work in them. As a result, the potential to reduce carbon in other stages of a building’s life has remained largely untapped. What I mean here is the carbon emissions involved in making, renovating and then eventually dismantling the building. This includes everything from mining the materials for the cement to chopping down the trees for the floorboards to transporting everything to the building site to digging the foundations; and then later from knocking the building down to disposing of its constituent parts.  We sometimes refer to the emissions while a building is functioning as the operational carbon, and all the other emissions across its life cycle as the  embodied carbon. Focusing on one and not the other is puzzling to say the least – we’re effectively trying to take the carbon out of our energy bills while paying no attention to the carbon in the buildings themselves.  While you can intervene along the way to improve the carbon emissions of a building’s energy use, there’s nothing you can do later about the emissions during construction. Not only that, interventions to improve a building’s energy efficiency actually make the total embodied carbon worse.  We rightly love insulation as a means of reducing a building’s heat requirement, but we install it with no regard for the carbon emissions produced in the process. And while, say, replacing fluorescent lighting with LEDs is an efficiency improvement that you can see, the carbon impact of the building will remain invisible until it has had an irreversible effect on the global environment.  The EU talks about Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEBs) as the goal of its energy efficiency regulations. The closer it gets to this goal, the greater the share of the building’s environmental impacts when you look at carbon emissions overall. If we ever achieve nZEBs, embodied carbon will be the totality of emissions and it will be far too late to start worrying about it then. Even now, it can make up as much as 90% of the whole-life emissions on some buildings, while its share is growing across the board.  So how to move forward? The most effective strategy is prevention, and a great deal can be done by designing our buildings with resource efficiency in mind. We tend to put much more materials into buildings than we need to – steel being a case in point. Buildings will still stand using much less steel, we just need to change the regulations.  There are also various other things we can do: pre-manufacturing component parts under controlled industrial conditions is an important way of saving emissions. Sourcing materials closer to home needs to be taken more seriously, as does recycling materials from old buildings and using waste to help us build. A great example is the Brighton Waste House in the south of England, which showed for instance that you can fill cavity walls with everything from old clothes to videotapes.  What this all requires is concerted and coordinated action from all the key stakeholders. Unfortunately, the COP23 Bonn-Fiji Commitment is only the latest initiative to essentially ignore this issue. Governments have broadly failed to pass regulations around embodied carbon, and the topic is often relegated to the margins or completely ignored when it comes to policymakers’ sustainability agendas. This is despite the fact that industry bodies and NGOs have actually led the way by producing a fair amount of guidance in this area.  Governments and other policy players are not even managing to agree on how to undertake a whole-life carbon assessment. If they don’t do this accurately, we’re liable to end up with a gap between how much embodied carbon we think we are creating and how much ends up being released into the atmosphere. This, too, needs much more attention.  The whole problem is particularly relevant at a time when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is saying there’s an urgent need to reduce carbon emissions sooner rather than later as it is too risky to rely on yet unproven technologies to save us at some point in the future.  Compared to some of the carbon reduction required to meet the commitments in the Paris Agreement – weaning us off electricity from fossil fuels, say – focusing on the embodied carbon emissions in buildings is actually low-hanging fruit. It is time for policy people to step up their game and join the challenge while there is still time. And once they have tackled buildings they should start considering all the other embodied carbon emissions that they have been ignoring, too."
"For four decades, EU legislation and policy has profoundly shaped the protection of the UK environment. It’s hard to predict exactly what Brexit will mean for Britain’s beaches, air pollution, recycling standards or wildlife conservation – but there is no doubt it will be significant. In addition to setting environmental quality standards, including for air, water and nature conservation, EU law has provided a dense and extensive framework that makes the government more accountable for its environmental obligations. My concern is that even the very softest of Brexits will expose gaps in purely domestic environmental governance. The role of European law in holding the government to account in the well-known air pollution cases brought by ClientEarth in 2015 and 2016 is indicative of the critical importance of the EU in environmental protection. Not only had the demanding air quality standards been set at EU level, but European law also imposed planning and reporting obligations on the government, ensuring transparency over its (lack of) progress. Moreover, the EU obligation on UK courts to take “any necessary measure” to ensure compliance with EU law was decisive in securing meaningful remedies, as the government was eventually ordered to draw up swifter plans to address air pollution. And of course, in the background sits scrutiny by the European Commission, and the possibility of EU-level legal action, and even fines against the UK government. Britain’s existing domestic mechanisms of judicial review and parliamentary scrutiny are simply not ready to plug the huge gaps left by EU law. Crucially, we need to ensure the government will be held to account for the protection of the environment post-Brexit. An independent, expert and adequately resourced body will be needed after Brexit to replace the EU’s role in scrutinising environmental policy and outcomes. Some may ask why existing agencies such as Natural England or the Environment Agency, who already provide expert advice to government, should not take on these tasks. These agencies, however, already form part of the government. The point is to hold the executive to account – including central and local government, and various government bodies and agencies – so those very bodies cannot do the job. The proposal to develop a new environmental body is not as radical as it might first appear. Indeed, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, recently promised to consult on the creation of a new environmental body to ensure the UK avoids a “governance gap” after leaving the EU.  The three criteria of independence, expertise and resources are tightly connected. Institutional independence from those providing funds (in this case probably government or business) is a perennial challenge. The imperfect, but more or less adequate, independence and resourcing of the European Commission with respect to scrutiny and enforcement, is a result at least in part of the mutual interest of the 28 member states in supervising each other, and so accordingly in empowering the Commission.  A UK wide body to “supervise” environmental governance, funded by the four executives, could begin to replicate that diffusion of authority and resourcing. A common (again imperfect) way of enhancing the independence of ombuds-type bodies is to make them responsible to parliament rather than government. That is also a possibility here. But what exactly does this new environmental body need to do? Crucially, it would need to report publicly – and to parliaments and assemblies – on the government’s own planning and reporting on environmental compliance. It would also need powers to compel relevant ministers to respond to its conclusions, to undertake its own investigations, and to demand remedial action. Where appropriate, it must be able to bring judicial review actions against government. We must also ensure that developing environmental standards and policy after Brexit remains a priority. With accountability in mind again, new environmental rules must be assessed against a clear set of statutory criteria. Those criteria should include at least: the involvement of a diverse range of interests, from industry to environmental groups, in the creation of new standards; consideration of the latest scientific evidence and of international and EU standards; the incorporation of environmental principles such as the precautionary principle; clear reporting on how new standards and policies were developed. As the UK prepares for Brexit, high environmental standards are worth fighting for. But so is a powerful governance framework that ensure those standards are actually implemented. After all, accountability is at the heart of democracy. A key role for environmental law is to empower those seeking to hold government to account. Maria Lee has written a full working paper on environmental accountability post-Brexit, which is available on the UCL European Institute website."
"The global wave of school strikes for the climate over the past year has “achieved nothing” because greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise, Greta Thunberg has told activists at UN climate talks in Madrid. Thousands of young people were expected to gather at the UN climate conference and in the streets of the Spanish capital on Friday to protest against the lack of progress in tackling the climate emergency, as officials from more than 190 countries wrangled over the niceties of wording in documents related to the Paris accord. In the four years since the landmark agreement was signed, greenhouse gas emissions have risen by 4% and the talks this year are not expected to produce new commitments on carbon from the world’s biggest emitters. Thunberg, whose solo protest in Sweden in 2018 has since snowballed into a global movement, spoke at a press conference before a march through the centre of Madrid. She said that although schoolchildren had been striking around the world, this “has not translated into action” from governments. “I’m just an activist and we need more activists,” she said. “Some people are afraid to change – they try so desperately to silence us.” Thunberg expressed hope for the UN negotiations but doubted whether governments had got the message, and warned the world could not afford continued inaction. “I sincerely hope COP25 will reach something concrete and increase awareness among people, and that world leaders and people in power grasp the urgency of the climate crisis, because right now it does not seem that they are,” she said. Although young people would keep striking, Thunberg said, they wanted to stop – if governments made credible promises and showed a willingness to act. “We can’t go on like this; it is not sustainable that children skip school and we don’t want to continue – we would love some action from the people in power. People are suffering and dying today. We can’t wait any longer,” she said. The march was scheduled to coincide with protests and youth climate strikes around the world. In the US, Bernie Sanders and Jane Fonda were among the politicians and celebrities planning to join in. As well as the march and a sit-down protest in the conference centre, there were shows of international solidarity among young people from around the world, including a picnic in a central Madrid park. The conference centre was flooded with hundreds of schoolchildren accompanied by their parents, many with babies in prams, who were kept separate from the rooms where negotiators were working on a draft text to clarify aspects of the Paris agreement. Young people voiced their frustration at protests inside and outside the conference centre on the outskirts of Madrid. Brianna Fruean from Samoa, speaking for the Pacific Climate Warriors, told the conference: “World leaders need to know that people like me are watching them. The text we put down today on paper at COP is what our future will look like.” Many of the young people joining the conference from developing nations around the world bore personal witness to suffering they had experienced or seen. “I’ve had typhoid. I’ve had malaria. My grandmother died from cholera. I know what I’m talking about,” said Jimmy Fénelon, the national coordinator of the Caribbean Youth Environmental Network in Haiti. “We need to raise awareness among young people. We can get them to work together and send a strong message.” Renae Baptiste, also from CYEN, said: “For us, climate change is no longer a concept or theory, it’s our new reality. It’s affecting our lives now.” The activist Miguel van der Velden said: “These things are not games. They’re getting worse. They’re affecting millions of people around the world. I come here because I have hope that we can work together.” • This article was updated on 9 December 2019 to correct the year Greta Thunberg’s school strike started – it was 2018, not 2017."

Share this...FacebookTwitterFellow climate blogger Robin Pittwood at the New Zealand-based Kiwi Thinker here brings us up-to-date on how the current 2011 – 2020 decade is doing temperature-wise.
Many readers are aware of a climate bet made with alarmists Rob Honeycutt and Mr. Know-it-all, Dana Nuccitelli. The skeptics bet the current decade would be cooler or the same as last decade – using the RSS and UAH satellite data, and not the made up surface stuff from NASA.
Robin’s latest calculations show that the current decade is (still) slightly cooler than the last one comprising 2001 – 2010.
Of course, as expected, the recent El Nino event closed the gap and will probably even push the current decade to be a bit warmer in the months ahead. The question that remains now is just how strong will the upcoming La Nina be? Will it be strong enough to send the global temperature downward over the next couple of years 2017 – 2019, similar to what we saw back in 2008?
Right now there are a number of indications that this is precisely what is going to happen.

We’re still seeing the effect of the El Nino nudging the green line closer.  Whether the lines cross over, and for how long, is still uncertain.  The El Nino indicators seem to have peaked and are beginning to decline, but as Bob Tisdale described at his blog, ‘Every El Nino is different’.”
So it looks like we are in a very close race, something that according to the alarmists was not supposed to happen. By now this decade was supposed to be a lot warmer. By the end of the decade it’s supposed to be some 0.2°C or 0.3°C warmer.
So even if the warmists did manage to eke out a victory by a few hundredths of a degree, it would be a very hollow one indeed.

"The cost of energy in the UK is once again a hot topic. During the party conference season, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, announced that the Scottish government will set up a publicly owned, not for profit energy company. Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn restated his wish to nationalise utility companies to “stop the public being ripped off”. And the Conservative prime minister Theresa May promised to fix the “broken” energy market, in part by imposing a cap on some domestic energy prices. The UK government swiftly followed this season of rhetoric with two supporting policy announcements. It has drawn up draft legislation to set an energy price cap, although this may take until the winter of 2018/19 to be enacted. Second, it has published a clean growth strategy, which promises “cleaner air, lower energy bills, greater economic security and a natural environment protected and enhanced for the future”.  It’s not easy to address the social, environmental and economic dimensions of domestic energy in one go, as these different goals interact with each other. For example, a price cap clearly makes energy more affordable, but it doesn’t reduce the amount of energy needed or used. While the sheer price of energy is problematic for many people, so too is inefficient housing which increases bills and associated greenhouse gas emissions. The clean growth strategy addresses this by reconfirming a commitment to require large energy companies to install efficiency measures such as insulation and heating systems. This scheme, the energy company obligation (ECO), now has £3.6 billion in funding through to 2028. It aims to help 2.5m fuel-poor households. Alongside stricter regulations within the private rented sector, the ECO is intended to upgrade all fuel-poor homes to a decent standard by 2030.  But it’s worth putting the rhetoric and promises of these policy announcements into context. Help for people in fuel poverty has decreased since 2010, largely due to the coalition government abandoning publicly funded schemes in England in favour of privately funded energy supplier obligations like ECO. Though social and environmental policies do add to fuel bills, policymakers assume that this increase is more than offset by people using less energy thanks to efficiency savings. In our research we are currently looking at whether ECO is an effective way to address affordability and energy efficiency in vulnerable people’s homes. England is the only one of the four UK nations that relies solely on this market-driven scheme, so it’s important to evaluate its impact. We recently highlighted a number of potential problems, and solutions. To begin with, only certain people are eligible. Proxies such as welfare benefits, demographics and postcodes are used, but they can arbitrarily exclude households on the margins of these measures who may indeed be vulnerable.  People also struggle to upgrade their homes if the work does not enable a certain amount of carbon savings at a certain price. In other words, private companies are likely to prioritise meeting their statutory obligations rather than findings and helping the most vulnerable households. Even for those that do secure funding, it’s at best a long and complicated process. Some upgrades are never completed because installers are not equipped to manage the needs of people with, for example, disabilities or mental health conditions.  What is clear from our comparative research of the UK nations is that state funded schemes, such as nest in Wales and home energy efficiency programmes in Scotland, are better able to target, and respond to the needs of, vulnerable households. Market driven schemes are different as they will, by definition, seek out the most cost effective work. But this ceases to be an asset once the low-hanging fruit has all been picked, and those with the greatest need (and potentially higher costs) are left subsidising other people’s housing upgrades.   An energy price cap will certainly provide some initial relief. But unless it is continually ratcheted down or extended to more customers it will not provide long-term savings or wider benefits. Increasing investment in energy efficiency ticks more social and environmental boxes, but the regressive approach to funding such a scheme in England means it will continue prioritising cost-effective carbon savings over helping those most in need."

The Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) here shows currently Arctic sea ice is at its highest level in years for this time of the year. Hat-tip: Kirye at Twitter.

Sea ice extent in recent years (in million km2) for the northern hemisphere, as a function of date.
In fact it appears it has reached its highest level ever over the last decade, and its only mid February. The DMI ice extent values are calculated from the data from the Ocean and Sea Ice, Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF), where areas with ice concentration higher than 30% are classified as ice, the site reports.
On the other hand, the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) here reports that January, 2016, saw the lowest Arctic sea ice extent (15%) on the satellite record. Other sources depicting 15% sea ice concentration extent also show similar low values.
The overall trend, however, shows nothing alarming. The following chart from the Cryosphere Today of the Arctic Climate Research at the University of Illinois shows Arctic sea ice remaining flat over the past decade.

"Oil palm trees plague the once untouched and wild island of Borneo. Towering rainforests have been chopped down and the land turned into a monotonous monoculture of plantations, the principle source of palm oil. In the Malaysian region of Sabah, in the north of the island, these trees now cover a staggering 20% of the entire state. The problems caused by palm oil have been well documented. Deforestation has led to huge fires, massive carbon emissions, and left orangutans on the brink of extinction. But what is happening on the plantations themselves? What has large-scale logging and forest conversion done for the ecosystem and its biodiversity?  Scavengers are an important but often overlooked group in understanding how ecosystems function. They provide vital services including the removal of carrion, which is a crucial component in recycling nutrients and preventing disease. And disruption of these groups has possible far-reaching implications. To investigate how scavenger communities were adapting to the new reality of oil palm plantations, I went to Sabah. Colleagues and I designed and made our own baited traps and set them up various different sites along rivers within the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) project. Some traps were in virgin jungle, others were in logged forest of varying levels of disturbance and some were among oil palm.  We captured 118 individual animals in all, with the most abundant being the Malay civet and the South-East Asian water monitor, a large lizard. Our bait was also investigated by domestic dogs, collared mongoose, smooth-coated otter, short-tailed mongoose, bearded pigs and sun-bears. Our results were published in PLoS One.  There was a consistent trend: the more disturbed the land, the more  water monitors we found, while their numbers decreased as we moved away from plantations into untouched forests. In fact, the Malay civet was the only native mammal recorded alongside water monitors in oil palm at all, and even this species preferred higher quality forest sites.  So why would lizards appear to be particularly at home in these plantations? The South-East Asian water monitor (Varanus salvator macromaculatus) originally evolved in the region’s mangroves and has remained largely unchanged for around 17m years. It’s primarily adapted for life in and around water, with nostrils positioned high on the end of an elongated snout for breathing while submerged, and a long tail that works as the perfect aquatic propulsion system. However, when the monitors are threatened the tail turns into a powerful club with a jagged crest that makes it all the more dangerous. Among rural populations in Borneo, water monitors have a negative reputation as a scavenger and a pest. But in most of their extensive range they are actually active hunters with eyes adapted for detecting movement, claws for climbing and gripping prey, and an arsenal of 60 backward-facing serrated teeth that evolved to cause maximum laceration and bleeding in their prey. These “dragons” have a phenomenal ability to eat almost anything that can fit inside their stomachs. Their diet includes small invertebrates, crustaceans and amphibians through to larger mammals, birds and their eggs. They’ll even eat other monitors.  As stress sometimes makes water monitors regurgitate their stomach contents, we were able to make some opportunistic observations of their diet. We found some truly mind boggling items, from human refuse such as instant noodle wrappers through to porcupine spines which are so hard and sharp they pierce through human skin with ease and deter almost all other predators.  This unfussy eating is what enables water monitors to survive in the wasteland of oil palm. In the natural forests that surround the plantations, they face competition from mammal scavengers and predators such as sun bears, otters, civets and mongooses. There, water monitors are found only in relatively low numbers and at significantly smaller sizes.  But those mammals struggle to survive in the plantations, where a lack of shade boosts the temperature and lower plant diversity filters up through the food chain. Lizards can handle the heat, of course, and the presence of extra food from human refuse means water monitors appear to thrive there, reaching terrifying sizes and high numbers.  A landscape filled with roaming giant lizards soon becomes a battle arena. Unlike smaller lizards who settle their disputes with a subtle arm waves, tail wags or flapping of their dewlap (neck skin), water monitors use a more archaic means: fighting. They stand on their muscular hind legs, stomach pressed to stomach and wrestle, they rip and claw and bite and tear, until one submits.  This “survival of the toughest” is what drove the males of the species to reach such formidable sizes. But it is also one of the reasons why degraded habitats such as oil palm may be an ecological trap. The easy availability of food from human garbage sites or domestic animals draws in extra male monitors, resulting in a heavily skewed sex ratio. Increased competition for prime spots in the plantations then means they use up lots of energy, and risk serious injury just holding onto their territory and fighting off other males. The increased parasite load that come from living at high densities reduces overall fitness of individuals, and in addition to energetic costs to adults, increased densities of a species that cannibalises juveniles of the same species, greatly deduces the chance of young making it to adulthood.   For now, these giant lizards appear healthy. Of Borneo’s large native scavengers, they are the only species that has successfully adapted to the plantations. But, in the long run, due to the culmination of adverse effects, water monitors may be doomed to the same fate as the bears and other mammals that once inhabited the space now dominated by oil palm."
"The Pantanal in central South America may not be as globally famous as the Amazon rainforest, but it has the continent’s highest concentration of wildlife. Now, however, the region’s endangered plants and animals, along with its still undiscovered secrets, may be wiped out in return for cheap hydroelectricity. The Pantanal is the world’s largest tropical wetland and covers an area slightly larger than England. It lies mostly on a huge floodplain at the foot of Brazil’s southwestern highlands, but a fraction also spills over into Bolivia and Paraguay. In the wet season, from October to April, water washes down from those highlands bringing with it nutrients and fish and leaving most of the region underwater. When the rains finish, and the ground dries up, the landscape changes once again. Seasonal variation on such a massive scale means the Pantanal contains a diverse range of plants and animals that have adapted to thrive in standing water or waterlogged soil. The region is home to more than 1,000 bird species and 300 mammals including the jaguar, capybara, giant otter and tapir. Yet the Pantanal is now threatened by Brazil’s thirst for hydroelectricity. We are part of a group of researchers investigating the state of Mato Grosso, where the rush to build dams is particularly apparent. Mato Grosso holds the upper reaches of the Pantanal, but is probably more famous for the Amazon rainforest in the north of the state and the enormous “fazendas” (large farms) on its fringes which produce soya, beef and cotton. This mixture of natural resources and fertile land means Mato Grosso has a long history of environmental issues. However, if the state today is recognised as a deforestation hotspot, soon it may be known for its dams. This is because the height difference between the rainy plateau in the north of the state and its southern plains means there is lots of hydroelectric potential.  Mato Grosso is following a nationwide trend. After a series of major blackouts in 2001 which highlighted Brazil’s energy insecurities, the country turned to hydroelectricity. Since then, a wave of dams have been, or are planned to be, constructed to satisfy the ever increasing demand for energy.  Over the past few years, Brazil’s growth acceleration programme has allowed for the increased construction of hydroelectric dams in the state, while also removing or weakening some environmental laws. There are already 38 operational hydroelectric plants in the Paraguay river’s upper basin, the region that drains into the Pantanal. A further 94 are due to be built in coming years.  In Brazil, dams are classified in two categories: those that are able to produce more than 30MW of energy, and small hydroelectric plants (SHP) with a capacity of less than 30MW and a reservoir of less than 13km². These small plants are seen as more environmentally friendly and are commonly constructed as part of a chain along the length of the river. In the Amazon, the impacts of the bigger dams have been well documented. Fish numbers are down, and irregular floods have exposed dry land that had previously been submerged during the wet season. Less research has been conducted in the Pantanal basin but the few reports that have investigated dams there report similar results. Additionally, one larger dam led to river depth fluctuating by several metres over weekly or even daily periods, confusing fish and affecting water quality. Less is currently known about the impacts of the smaller hydroelectric dams but, as they still store some water in the reservoir in order to produce energy at peak times, especially in low-flow rivers, they thus also affect the river’s daily fluctuations. What we do know is that too many dams on the rivers that feed the Pantanal would disrupt the natural rhythm of the wetland. Large-scale cattle ranchers, soy farmers and city dwellers drive year-round demand for water and energy, which would put the seasonal flood “pulse” at risk. In this scenario, species that have adapted themselves over thousands of years to life in an on-off wetland may find themselves thrown out of sync.  Even several small plants close to each other can produce new patches of still surface water, fragmenting ecosystems and affecting ecological relationships. Meanwhile, those whose livelihoods are dependent on these cycles, mainly traditional fishing communities, may find they can no longer survive.  As the impacts of hydroelectric dams become apparent in the Amazon, it is crucial that we do not forget the Pantanal. If the wetland is going to survive, it will take a concerted effort from all actors who use its resources to work together. The Pantanal is a complex ecosystem where society and the environment clash on a number of issues. With the increasing demand for electricity and solar and wind options being little investigated in Mato Grosso, it is important the full impacts of hydroelectric generation are known."
"Imagine a world without trees, and then try to think about the changes that would need to happen for these trees to evolve from the small primitive plants that came before them. I spend as much time as I can trying to find evidence for this transition, which is currently estimated to have happened between 390-380m years ago, in the Mid-Devonian Epoch. One plant type, the extinct cladoxylopsids – an ancient plant group now only found as fossils – has continually demanded my attention. Despite these fossils first being found in the 1850s, understanding of the plants was highly confused for decades. This is a common problem in the study of fossil plants, because the living plants fall apart when they die, and it is often hard to determine which parts of which fossils should be joined back together. But during the 2000s we had major successes in reconstructing Devonian cladoxylopsids, culminating in a series of extraordinary discoveries of complete or almost complete fossil trees in Scotland, Gilboa, New York and Germany.  The picture that emerged of the earliest types of cladoxylopsid – by then recognised to be the first forms of tree to appear – was of a long tapering trunk, up to at least eight metres high, with distinctive short branches attached around the top to form a crown. From a distance, the trees would have looked like palms, with bases up to a metre in diameter. There were no leaves as such, just branched twig-like appendages which presumably had a photosynthetic function in the carbon dioxide rich atmosphere of those times.  Most trees today have a solid trunk, which gets bigger through the formation of a new ring of woody tissues – made up of xylem cells – under the bark each year.  In cladoxylopsids, however, the xylem grew in a ring of individual parallel strands around the outside of the trunk. Inside this zone, more xylem strands formed a complex network with many interconnections both to each other and to the outer parallel strands. The majority of the inside of the trunk was completely hollow. This unusual structure is confusing, and raises questions about how ancient trees managed to grow so big. The outer parallel strands could easily allow for the trunk diameter to expand just by moving apart from each other, and the space between filled with soft tissues known as parenchyma.  But the inner network of xylem strands is a different matter. Trying to expand the diameter of this network would be catastrophic. Not only would the wood resist the change of shape, but as the outside diameter widened, the inside of the tree would be pulled inwards and downwards relative to the outside, and the whole plant would collapse. Understanding how cladoxylopsids managed to grow so big was going to need an extraordinary fossil – which arrived on my desk in late 2012 as a small trunk preserved in silica from volcanic eruptions in north-west China. The glassy silica had filled the plant cells, but not destroyed the cell walls, so we could study every cell present in the plant on the day it died. Even more incredibly, in 2015 another perfectly preserved trunk more than 70cm in diameter was found by my Chinese colleagues. What we learnt from these fossils was amazing. Each of the many hundreds of xylem strands in the tree had its own growth rings, adding woody tissue around the outside on a regular basis. The cross section looks like a ring of little trees all growing in unison. However the soft parenchyma tissue between the xylem strands was the most informative. Rather than being crushed by the growth of the wood in the stem, the tissue seemed to be proliferating on a prodigious scale. This provided the power to push the strands apart and expand the trunk diameter. As a last trick, the shape of these normally round cells could be used to detect the strain put upon them. We found that the interconnections of the woody xylem strands were being slowly ripped apart as the tree grew. But at the same time the damage was being repaired, which kept the plant functioning and structurally sound as the woody skeleton accommodated the growth. Overall we determined that the bottom of the trunk slowly collapsed outward to form the large flat-bottomed tree bases characteristic of this type of plant. No tree does anything as complicated today. Several types of plants, notably palms, grow a little by diffuse expansion of the soft parenchyma tissues, but this does not appear to have dramatic consequences for the xylem skeleton.  Cladoxylopsid growth has to go down in history as the most complex way to become a tree. Maybe the lack of competition from other tree types at the beginning was what allowed this to occur. We know that simpler forms of cladoxylopsids lived towards the end of the Devonian period, and that shortly after they became extinct. Perhaps they were outcompeted by other types of plants with simpler growth strategies, or plants with seeds, or they could not cope with the low carbon dioxide world they helped create. Whatever the reason for their extinction, this new finding of how they grew will help us understand how cladoxylopsids shaped our early terrestrial environments and how they interacted with the atmosphere."
"Chocolate lovers probably don’t want any new reasons to feel guilty about eating chocolate. But there is growing public awareness of the impact of cocoa on tropical forests, particularly in West Africa, where two-thirds of the world’s cocoa is produced.  Recently, at the Climate Change conference in Bonn (COP23), the government of Ghana and the major cocoa and chocolate companies operating in the country launched a Joint Framework for Action that aims to end deforestation and promote forest protection and restoration in the cocoa supply chain in Ghana, with a strong commitment to also supporting farmers’ livelihoods and rights. Contrary to recent claims, awareness of the links between deforestation and cocoa production isn’t new. The announcement at COP23 builds on many years of work, dating back to 2009, involving a range of different governmental and non-governmental organisations collaborating on developing the idea of climate-smart cocoa. The collaborators include the NGO Nature Conservation Research Centre, the Climate Change Unit of the Ghana Forestry Commission, the Ghana Cocoa Board, research organisations including the Forest Research Institute of Ghana and the private sector.  Having made an ambitious and bold statement of intent, the challenge now facing Ghana and the cocoa companies is how to deliver on the goal of protecting forests while simultaneously supporting sustainable livelihoods.  Along with colleagues, we have been working on an Ecosystem Services for Poverty Alleviation (ESPA) research project examining the cocoa forest landscape in Ghana’s Central Region. Some of our findings offer insights into the challenges in delivering the Joint Framework for Action.  Critical among these is the finding that addressing the incentives that farmers have to retain trees on their farms will be an essential part of successfully delivering on the cocoa sector’s commitment on forests. Recent reports on cocoa and deforestation have provided simplified portrayals of cocoa farmers, stating that many remove ancient trees from forests to make way for full-sun cocoa farms. This is problematic and misleading for two main reasons.  First, it does not account for the variety of approaches to farming cocoa. Farmers in our study area, where cocoa has been grown for decades, retain trees on their farms in line with government recommendations (between 16 and 18 mature shade trees per hectare).  But the government can grant timber concessions to timber companies to fell trees on farms. We found, as have several other studies, that farmers do not have sufficient power to prevent companies from felling the trees they have nurtured on their farms to shade cocoa.  Indeed, farmers currently have minimal rights to the trees on their farms, and therefore have minimal incentives and limited power to retain them even if they want to. Blaming cocoa farmers for deforestation confuses the direct and underlying causes of deforestation. We must address the issues around tree tenure in a way that empowers farmers to nurture trees should they choose to, and to benefit from doing so. This is critical to the successful delivery of the cocoa sector’s commitment on forests.  This also perpetuates a tendency, particularly among the Western media, to blame poor farmers in poor countries for environmental degradation. It tends to marginalise the role of consumption, and the power imbalances among different actors in the market. This results in the more powerful actors maintaining control of the agenda, which is often to the detriment of the poorest in society.  Our research found that while higher household cocoa income was associated with better school attendance and food security, other important components of poverty – such as access to clean drinking water or healthcare services – were not influenced by cash income. Furthermore, the poorest people in cocoa communities are those with little or no land. This is more common among women and young people. It is important, therefore, that investments in the sector do not focus exclusively on increasing yields, but also target communal infrastructure that benefits people living in rural areas without access to land.  The Joint Framework for Action commendably contains reference to ensuring that women and young people are not excluded from efforts to engage and empower communities. But one of the critical questions that will dictate whether the framework is a success or not is how this works in practice. In particular, it remains to be seen how the companies and states balance this objective with their interests in increasing supply and profitability.   As the issue of cocoa and deforestation fades from the news cycle it will be important to hold the sector and governments to account for the actions this agreement triggers. Doing so, however, requires unwrapping the complexity of the challenge. Otherwise, consumers’ concerns risk perpetuating colonial stereotypes about small-scale farmers degrading the environment and lead to strategies with the wrong targets in their sights."
"Waste plastics contaminate our food, water and air. Many are calling for a global ban on single-use plastics because throwing them “away” often means into our river systems and then into the world’s oceans. Take the UK’s single-use plastic bottles: it’s estimated that 35m are used – and discarded – each day, but only 19m are recycled. The 16m bottles that aren’t recycled go to incinerators, landfill or the environment, even though, being PET (polyethylene terephthalate) they are easily reprocessed. Even those bottles that are placed in the recycle stream may be shipped to Asia, in a global market for waste plastics that is itself leaky. It’s suspected that much of the “recycling” shipped to Asia may be joining local waste in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. This soupy collection of plastic debris is trapped in place by ocean currents, slowly breaking into ever-smaller pieces, but never breaking down. Covered by bacterial plaques, they are mistaken for food by fish. Ingested, they contaminate the food chain and, potentially, may even be disrupting the biophysical systems that keep our oceans stable, thus contributing to climate change. So we need to use far less plastic, re-use what we can, and dispose of what we must far more wisely. In facing this challenge, developed countries can learn from innovations in the less-developed world. People, globally, are innovating, creating new processes to use waste plastics and making new objects and art forms. The Philippines, for example, is the world’s third biggest plastic polluter. Waste material, even from municipal collections, makes its way into the river systems and, from there, out into the open Pacific, contributing to its “plastic soup”. But it’s largely what happens on land that determines the load the oceans must bear.  Industrial recycling isn’t accessible to most people in the Philippines. Even if recycling were available, shipping their waste to China, long the centre of the global plastics recycling industry, is no longer a viable option: the industry is now the target of regulation by the Chinese government, eager to clean up its own environment.   Some waste in the Philippines is reprocessed locally. But people living in remote, rural areas have a stark choice. Either they bury their plastic waste locally, burn it, or come up with innovative solutions to repurpose the material instead. Given the unpalatable nature of the first two options, the country now has an innovative, artisanal plastic craft movement. A few years ago, I worked with craftspeople and artists to put together an exhibition of repurposed plastic waste. The items that really stood out were those things that local people made according to traditional patterns. These were items people used for cultural events that marked their identity as tribal Filipinos. Much of the work of experimentation with the materials was happening in kitchens and workplaces as people shared techniques and tips with each other. One of our contributing craftspeople, Ikkay, lives in a remote tribal village in Kalinga Province. She makes strands of plastic beads out of bits of waste plastic, using old CD cases and fast food spoons – anything with a bit of gloss. Her beads are replicas of traditional tribal designs. These beads are used in local cultural performances and shipped all over the world for demonstrations of Filipino dance.  Another example of creative re-purposing came from the nearby gold mines. There, mine workers weave the yellow, red and pink plastic wrappers of blasting cap detonators into traditional basket forms. They find the high quality wrappers just as good as the rattan they’d originally used. Burly mineworkers walking the roads with dainty pink-and-yellow plastic backpacks have become a frequent site in and around mining communities.  In both these examples – beads and backpacks – people had figured out innovative ways to re-purpose waste plastic. They took material that would have been garbage and turned it into an item that expressed important cultural values, making something cool, fun, and desirable.  The material itself – waste plastic – has something to do with this. In these Filipino cases, it made tribal displays of beads extra impressive. The makers and wearers of these items were not just subverting ideas about waste, but about social hierarchies and the social power to innovate and set trends. People who admired the plastic craft started to see plastic no longer as just “stuff” on its way to being garbage. Instead, it became imbued with the potential to become something new and different and a way of asserting local ingenuity and identity in a global world. These examples from the Philippines are not isolated ones. Around the world, there are many small-scale groups doing very similar kinds of projects with re-purposed plastic waste. Rehash Trash in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, makes baskets out of used plastic bags. Ocean Sole in Kenya works with discarded plastic flip-flops to make art. Other initiatives are networks, like that created by Precious Plastic a 3D printing initiative from Amsterdam. They have groups all over the world building 3D printers to create re-purposed plastic items for local markets. In the UK, people have used fine art to communicate the urgency of the issue to the wider public, whether it’s a giant plastic whale touring the UK or the artist Stuart Haygarth’s collection of plastic waste from UK beaches, hanging in University College Hospital London. But pointing out the problem is only the first step in providing comprehensive solutions. We need to reduce our plastics footprint, seek out items made from recycled materials, and – most importantly – learn, hands on, about new ways to reuse what is now a ubiquitous class of waste materials. People are meeting the challenges plastic waste poses in creative ways. While the end goal will be to phase out the materials creating the bulk of the pollution, in the meantime we must improve the capture of recycling systems globally and make locally recycled and re-purposed materials more desirable and acceptable. Learning to love plastic – wisely – means taking on the responsibility for our own discarded items.  We could take up the examples of these local innovation workshops and 3D printing groups to get making in communities worldwide. While making new items won’t halt the consumption of plastics altogether, it will divert material from the waste stream while helping people to see its potential. Offering the public a chance to co-create part of the solution should make the inevitable regulatory responses - deposits, disposal taxes and more rigorous waste sorting - more acceptable.  After all, waste plastic is still plastic and amazing stuff – you can make it into pretty much anything you can imagine."
" Greenpeace has been banned from carrying out climate protests on North Sea oil rigs after the oil giant Shell won a Scottish court order. A judge in Edinburgh granted Shell an interim interdict, similar to an injunction, banning Greenpeace from occupying four of its rigs in the Brent field 85 miles north-east of Shetland, after its activists boarded two decommissioned rigs in October.  Lady Carmichael, sitting in the court of session in Edinburgh, said Greenpeace was unlawfully breaching Shell’s property rights and also putting its own activists’ safety at risk. In a significant legal victory for Shell, Carmichael banned the campaign group from going within 500 metres of any of its installations in the Brent field, and ordered Greenpeace to pay Shell’s legal costs. She said campaigners had no absolute right to choose where they protested and that Greenpeace ships could have mounted a protest 500 metres away from the rigs. Greenpeace is deciding whether to appeal, but environment campaigners said this decision could have significant implications for climate activists by limiting where and how they could protest. Greenpeace also occupied a BP oil rig twice earlier this year, leading to the arrests of 14 activists in the Cromarty Firth. Richard Dixon, chief executive of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said a trend was emerging. The Metropolitan police had won a blanket ban against street occupations by Extinction Rebellion in London, while the chemicals firm Ineos won a ban on anti-fracking protests at any of its sites in England. Both bans were overturned on appeal, but Dixon said orders restricting how and where people could protest had a chilling effect.  “This is a challenge for Greenpeace: it is taking away its opportunities to do something strong enough to draw attention to the climate crisis, a vital issue it’s rightly trying to highlight,” Dixon said. Shell sought the interdict after Greenpeace occupied the Brent Alpha and Bravo platforms in October in protest at its decision to leave 11,000 tonnes of oil sediment in the legs of three of its four platforms in the Brent field, which are being decommissioned. Greenpeace told the court Shell was trying to get an exemption from strict international rules on marine pollution, which the UK is a party to, which prevent oil firms from leaving installations at sea after they are decommissioned. Shell has asked the UK government to support its application under the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic, known as the Ospar convention, to leave the disused concrete legs of the four rigs at sea.  Greenpeace says they will eventually corrode, releasing all that oil into the environment, a claim Shell has rejected. Carmichael said allowing protests at such exposed and dangerous sites put the safety of protesters and potential rescue personnel at unjustified risk. She ruled that Shell’s rights to protect its property outweighed Greenpeace’s rights under European human rights law to demonstrate peacefully. Meike Rijksen, one of the Greenpeace Netherlands activists who occupied the Brent platforms in October, said: “We will continue to fight against Shell’s plans to dump these 11,000 tonnes of oil in the North Sea. We really believe we are right it shouldn’t be allowed.” Shell welcomed the ruling. “We wholeheartedly support the right to protest peacefully and safely. We’re pleased this decision recognises that the existing legal safety zone should be respected by campaigners,” a spokesman said."
" Leading scientists have expressed concern about the lack of focus on the climate crisis as bushfires rage across New South Wales and Queensland, saying it should be a “wake-up call” for the government. Climate experts who spoke to Guardian Australia said they were “bewildered” the emergency had grabbed little attention during the final parliamentary sitting week for the year, which was instead taken up by the repeal of medevac laws, a restructure of the public service, and energy minister Angus Taylor’s run-in with the American author Naomi Wolf.  Escalating conditions on Thursday and Friday led to dozens of out-of-control bushfires, including in the NSW’s Hawkesbury region, where a fire at Gospers Mountain merged with two other blazes burning in the lower Hunter on Friday. Sydney has been blanketed with a thick smoke haze that health officials said had led to a 25% increase in people presenting in emergency departments for asthma and breathing problems. Sarah Perkins-Kirkpatrick, a climate scientist with the University of NSW’s Climate Change Research Centre, said she was “surprised, bewildered, concerned” that the emergency had prompted little discussion from political leaders this week. “Here we are in the worst bushfire season we’ve ever seen, the biggest drought we’ve ever had, Sydney surrounded by smoke, and we’ve not heard boo out of a politician addressing climate change,” she said. “They dismissed it from the outset and haven’t come back to it since. “They’re burying their heads in the sand while the world is literally burning around them and that’s the scary thing. It’s only going to get worse.” Mark Howden, the director of the Australian National University’s Climate Change Institute and a vice-chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said while the fires were raging on, “the commentary in terms of climate change has very much died down”. “Yesterday they did a public service reshuffle, or there was medevac, or the ‘union-busting’ bill,” he said. “The government chooses the points they want to discuss in the parliament and the fact they haven’t chosen to discuss it sends a message to me. “Essentially, it’s a question of priorities, that’s how I interpret it.” Howden said the general public had already joined the dots about the rising number of extreme weather days that brought heat, wind and dry conditions and high fire danger. He said all of the indicators of fire danger were starting to change and the effects of this were evident through increased frequency of fires, larger fire areas, more severe fires, fires burning in ecosystems not prone to fire and a longer fire season. Euan Ritchie, a wildlife ecologist at Deakin University, said he was “deeply concerned” that the extent and severity of the current fires meant that ecosystems that shouldn’t be burning – such as rainforests in NSW – were on fire. “It’s another example of failure to act on climate change, which is hurting people’s lives as well as nature,” he said. “There needs to be increased attention on the impact of climate change and it’s relationship with fire and how that threatens humans as well as nature and the environment.” Martin Rice, the head of research at the Climate Council, said the devastating fire conditions predicted by emergency leaders this year when they requested a meeting with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, were unfolding. He said Morrison had still failed to meet with emergency leaders, however both Taylor and the emergency services minister David Littleproud have now done so. Rice said the government was “failing to respond” to the climate crisis and to the “health emergency” created by toxic air around greater Sydney. “This has to be a wake-up call to the federal government,” he said. Rice said the Reserve Bank, medical practitioners, councils and mayors, emergency leaders and students were just some of the people who had made recent public pleas for a response. “All walks of life in Australia are demanding action,” he said. "
"Should Scotland have a specialist court to preside over environmental disputes and crimes? After giving this question about as much consideration as the 17-year-old Jeremy Corbyn gave to a career in investment banking, the Scottish government said no. This is an old debate in Scotland, with calls for such a court since the early 1990s. At the end of September the government published its response to a 2016 consultation on Developments in Environmental Justice in Scotland. This followed the SNP’s 2011 manifesto commitment to “publish an options paper” on environmental courts. Options papers usually include options, yet there were none. Instead, the 2016 consultation involved the Scottish government praising its reforms to the justice system, and then more or less asking: Does Scotland really need an environmental court? Scotland – a country in which 45 sea lochs were reported this year as being “toxic timebombs” due to pesticide contamination from fish farms – is behind the times. In Australia, the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales opened in 1980 as a “one-stop shop” for environmental, planning and land disputes. It was one of the first of its kind around the world. Two studies by environmental justice academics George and Catherine Pring found there has been a global “explosion” of environmental courts and tribunals since then. By 2009, there were over 350 in 41 different countries. By 2016, there were more than 1,200 in 44 countries. There are 28 environmental courts and tribunals in nine EU member states, with another 20 countries discussing or planning their own environmental courts or tribunals.  In England and Wales, an environmental tribunal was created in 2010. Initially set up with a limited remit to hear appeals against sanctions and fines from environmental regulators, its jurisdiction has expanded to cover other kinds of appeals, such as decisions relating to marine licensing and plastic bag charges. Environmental laws can combine international, European and domestic obligations – and they are often scientific in nature. There are concerns that judges lack the technical and scientific expertise to handle these cases effectively. Most Scottish environmental cases use the judicial review process, which is very pricey. Earlier this year, The John Muir Trust had to shell out £125,000 to the Scottish government and energy company SSE after its unsuccessful challenge to the Stronelairg Windfarm. This was negotiated down from an initial £539,000 and did not include the trust’s own legal fees. The enforcement of planning and environmental laws is questionable. As ClientEarth CEO and lawyer James Thornton pointed out:  When you pass an environmental law … and you do not enforce it, you in effect authorise the conduct you sought to prohibit. Environmental courts can address these problems. Providing specialist judges and accessible procedures can help citizens to ensure that key laws protecting the environment are upheld. Scotland already has specialist courts and tribunals covering all sorts of topics, such as employment, mental health and immigration matters. It’s not entirely clear why the Scottish government decided against an environmental court, but three reasons emerge from the 2017 consultation analysis and response: a) everything’s fine; b) there won’t be enough cases; c) Brexit uncertainty. These claims do not stand up to scrutiny. Rights without any means of enforcement are truly useless. As part of the UK, Scotland is bound by the UN’s Aarhus Convention which requires that people must be able to challenge situations where their environmental rights are denied or environmental laws are broken. Article 9(4) says that these challenges must be “not prohibitively expensive”. But access to environmental justice is prohibitively expensive in Scotland. This was the conclusion of the convention’s 2014 Meeting of the Parties. The Compliance Committee carried out progress reviews in 2015 and early 2017, and thought the same. The 2017 Meeting of the Parties repeated its 2014 conclusion, criticising Scotland for not yet fulfilling its commitments on environmental justice. Confusingly, the 2016 consultation told of Scotland’s “ongoing compliance” with the convention. The Scottish government’s 2017 decision tells of measures taken “to ensure Scotland is fully compliant with all aspects of the Aarhus Convention”. During the consultation, RSPB Scotland requested information about the number of environmental cases lodged annually, but the Scottish government said it didn’t hold this information. If it doesn’t keep figures, how can it claim with any confidence that there won’t be enough cases? The caseload depends on several factors. A lack of access to justice will keep it artificially low. It’s difficult to estimate the workload of the court if we don’t know what it will do (linked back to the lack of options in the 2016 consultation paper). Some of those consulted suggested extending the Scottish Land Court, an existing court which already has a sufficient caseload to justify its existence. The Scottish government rightly pointed out that Brexit will bring uncertainty for environmental governance. We’re told that this is a reason against an environmental court, but not why. One area of agreement on Brexit is that the warning lights are flashing red for the environment. EU membership brings a sophisticated framework of environmental governance. The European Commission currently polices key environmental laws, but Brexit will likely terminate its guardianship – and there is no obvious replacement. To fill the gap, the ability of NGOs and the public to enforce environmental laws could be increased. An environmental court could aid this kind of citizen enforcement. The decision against an environmental court relies on shaky reasoning. The Scottish minister for community safety and legal affairs, Annabelle Ewing, is not Hermione Granger; words cannot magic Scotland out of its non-compliance with the Aarhus Convention. Claiming that there won’t be enough cases is a bit like saying that there will be a shortage of cleaning robots by the year 2452 – we have no idea, and it depends on several factors. The uncertainty surrounding Brexit intensifies the need for change, not inaction. This was a disappointing consultation. The SNP’s manifesto promise to publish an “options paper” remains unfulfilled – and there is little evidence to support the Scottish government’s claim to be committed to environmental justice."

Share this...FacebookTwitterAs expected, we are now finding out the Paris climate climate agreement has been spectacularly oversold to the public as a success for climate protection.
Now that the text has been examined, it is clear that the agreement, which cannot even be called a treaty, and which has yet to be “ratified”, is turning out to be an empty package of pompous proclamations, opt-outs and intents.
Global warming godfather James Hansen has even called the conference and its result a fraud. Economic expert Prof. Bjorn Lomborg wrote at Twitter that the agreement will be “extraordinarily costly“, and that it “will do little – if anything to rein in global warming.”
At his blog renowned climatologist Dr. Roy Spencer ridiculed the watered-down agreement, implying that it is a meaningless feel-good gesture.
Michael Limburg European Institute for Climate and Energy (EIKE) wrote that the agreement is not even a treaty, reminding us that it was even forbidden by President Obama to call it a “treaty”. EIKE calls the agreement “a failure” and that it is not possible to control the climate with “declarations of intent” EIKE adds that “participation in all climate protection measures remain for the most part voluntary and that no sanctions were agreed on and that even the climate faithful have had to concede that this it is useless“.
Limburg writes that the only success of the agreement is: “The UN has taken an important step closer to reaching the target of transforming the current world order into one of a central planning system“.
Climate experts Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt write at Die kalte Sonne:

After years of fruitless climate conferences, the breakthrough supposedly has now been suddenly reached. But is it true? A closer look at the agreement document brings a surprise: Much remains optional, and financial commitments are kept limited. And that is good because the scientific basis of climate change is on very shaky ground on every front. It almost appears as if the media agree beforehand to report on this positively this time around in order to lend momentum to climate policymaking. A failure this time would have led the public to wonder.”
At the Handelsblatt here meteorologist Karsten Schwanke says “the climate agreement is a catastrophe!“
Indeed the targets come up much too short, weather expert Karsten Schwanke belives. At the current pace we are headed for 3.2 to 5.4°C of warming until the year 2100 – and with our emissions we are moving along close to the top of the upper range.”
Wanting to pile onto the voluntary requirement of 1.5°C – to say it mildly – is foreign to reality.”
Die Welt/Prof Mojib Latif
At the online flagship daily Die Welt, climatologist Mojib Latif is reported to be dissatisfied with agreement, and is quoted as saying the countries agreed on the “lowest common denominator” for climate protection.
With these targets the agreed global warming cannot be achieved.”
Die Welt notes that despite all the lofty rhetoric the world is not really taking the problem seriously, noting that “since the early 1990s global CO2 emissions have risen 60 percent“.

Share this...FacebookTwitterAngry mobs of leftists attacking Donald Trump rallies and the US Justice Department threatening to criminalize climate science dissent are just the latest undeniable, very clear signs the entrenched Establishment is in all out panic mode.
If anything is certain, it is that they’ve lost the argument, and violence seems to be their last resort.
AP photo here: “DON’T TELL US HOW TO DRESS. TELL THEM NOT TO RAPE”. We could also say: “Don’t tell us what to say, tell them not to attack”.
Reports indicate that Moveon.org was behind the Chicago attack. Yet many of us know that there are others who are very nervous about the Trump phenomenon. The Republican Establishment hates him because they see themselves losing control of the Party and becoming irrelevant (they already are).
But what’s more telling are the attacks that are coming from the Far Left, such as the one organized in Chicago. Why would they want to destroy a candidate that everyone keeps telling us has no chance at defeating Hillary Clinton? The answer is that the opposite is true. The Democrats are in fact extremely terrified of Trump, and they have more than just an inkling that the flamboyant billionaire will likely beat the pants off Hillary. Indeed Trump’s appeal has spread into the Democrat working class base.
Blame the victim for rape

Also what’s been interesting is the reaction to the mob attacks from Trump’s other adversaries. Though the motivations behind the reactions are different, they all agree that it is Donald Trump himself who is responsible, at least in part, for the mob attacks. They tell us that Trump’s tone provokes violence. This has come from people you’d least expect it, like Ted Cruz. It is a disappointment that this constitutional expert would side with an angry mob and not stand up for free speech.
It is clear that Cruz and other Republican candidates have grown frustrated and desperate. Claims that Trump is responsible are really no different from those claiming the rape victim is at fault because she looked attractive. It’s a pathetic argumentation that won’t convince anyone with an IQ over 40.
If Trump’s positions on important issues are so off the wall, then it should be an easy task to take them apart in a civil debate. But this hasn’t been possible. Could it be that his message is one that bears too much inconvenient truth?
Criminalizing climate science dissent
Another sign the Establishment is in deep trouble is the recent effort by Justice Department head Loretta Lynch to criminalize scientific dissent in climate science. This one effort is so primitive and Medieval that it can only backfire. What kind of society do we live in when dissent on issues like climate change needs to be shut down with force and dissenters investigated and possibly prosecuted by the FBI? When things are that out of control and corrupt, then we ought not wonder when Donald Trump types take off.
I’m no fan of Donald Trump and I am very nervous about some of his positions. But after the latest attacks, I find myself warming to him, and cooling on Cruz. The precious right to free speech is clearly at stake and Trump is the one at the front lines taking the arrows. People now more than ever must not be afraid to stand up.

"Last week’s climate debate on Channel 4 was the first televised election debate between party leaders dedicated to climate issues to take place anywhere in the world. This fact on its own makes it a credit to all those involved, and particularly to the environmental charity, Possible (previously called 10:10 Climate Action), that came up with the idea. The enormous challenge of global heating is not easily compressed into campaign soundbites, or even into manifestos. The changes required are global as well as national, and will take more than five years to implement. But the phrase made famous by the novelist Primo Levi “If not now, when?”, quoted by the Green party co-leader, Siân Berry, was apt. Last year’s warning from the UN’s top scientists, that the window of opportunity for action to prevent catastrophic heating is shrinking, focused minds. It led to an unprecedented upsurge in grassroots environmental activism around the world. Last Thursday’s debate provided an opportunity for UK voters to see whether, and to what extent, the messages from scientists and protesters have been absorbed.  If the Greens treat every election as a “climate election”, the emphasis on the environment in Labour’s 2019 manifesto is both unprecedented and overdue. Campaigners were disappointed that the target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, endorsed at this year’s party conference, was dropped. But Labour’s programme has been scored above the Liberal Democrat and SNP manifestos by environmentalists. All are far more ambitious than Conservative plans. Perhaps inevitably, the urgency and power of the overall theme of climate emergency faltered, during the Channel 4 debate as in other contexts, when it came to the technical details of rival schemes to retrofit homes and tackle aviation pollution. But seeing the party leaders answer these questions directly, rather than leaving them to more junior colleagues, was important. So was the refusal of the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to take part. In a Conservative campaign that has been characterised by dishonesty and bad faith, turning down Channel 4’s invitation and then, at the last minute, trying to bounce the broadcaster into accepting Michael Gove as a stand-in, is a stunt for which Mr Johnson’s party deserves to be punished at the ballot box. Climate change, and how to deal with it, is one of the biggest foreign policy challenges of the next government’s term and the next decade. A hard Brexit might see the UK trying to secure a deal with the US, which has ruled out any reference to climate change in trade talks. The US’s withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, which is expected to be enacted the day after next year’s presidential election (unless it is cancelled by a different president), is a moment to be dreaded. The danger that faltering efforts at international cooperation will collapse altogether, to be replaced by a grim battle over diminishing global resources, is real. The round of UN climate talks that have just opened in Madrid is a precursor to the showdown to come in Glasgow in a year’s time, when countries (with or without the US) must fulfil their Paris treaty obligations by committing to binding targets for emissions cuts. With Brexit and the NHS higher up most voters’ list of priorities than the environment, the number of people who will factor the prospect of such negotiations into their choice next week is likely to be small. The big picture of rising emissions and multilateral failures does not sit easily with ambitious promises of a “green new deal” at home. But as the polls gently narrow, the extent to which climate science has been absorbed into Labour’s programme is a reason to hope for any result other than a victory for Mr Johnson. His refusal to debate a defining and existential issue of our time is yet more evidence that he is unfit to hold the office of prime minister."
"Must we always talk for victory, and never once for truth, for comfort, and joy – Ralph Waldo Emerson. On Sunday night we gasped in awe at the latest stunning images of marine life in BBC’s marvellous Blue Planet II. Blue sharks dodged great whites to scavenge on oceanic carrion; a baby turtle took its chance to shelter on some remote piece of driftwood; albatrosses sadly caressed one another as their final chick took flight; spinner dolphins, yellowfin tuna and giant rays raced for the spoils of a giant bait ball; sperm whales dozed vertically then plunged to unfathomable depths to feed. For the fourth week running it was jaw dropping stuff.  In the final set piece, narrator David Attenborough’s tone changed – as it does when he has bad news. He showed us grim images of a turtle tangled in plastic debris, a beautiful tropical fish sheltering among our waste, and most heartbreaking of all, a mother pilot whale unable to let go of her long-dead infant as the rest of her family grieved.  “Today in the Atlantic waters they have to share the ocean with plastic. A mother is holding her newborn young – it’s dead,” he said.  Attenborough’s wise voiceover described the sadness of the great cetaceans, and the threat of plastic waste to top predators, and showed us more plastic debris. He then returned to the grieving giants: “The mother’s milk may have been contaminated by plastics.” This had a big impact. The Daily Telegraph headline “Shocked Blue Planet viewers vow never to use disposable plastic again after heartbreaking whale scene” captured the reaction of many. And the message boards buzzed on Twitter:  I know the messages – researchers have shown there could already be over five trillion pieces of plastic in the ocean; that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish; that our oceanic giants are becoming islands of garbage; that birds are starving as they fill their guts with plastic waste; that microplastic is in our seafood. I wanted to stand up and say “Yes, that’s it, that’s what we need!” but the scientist in me held me back.  In the whole sequence, there was no direct link made between the death of the baby whale and the plastic debris we saw in parallel footage; no evidence that its mother’s milk actually contained contamination from plastics. Nothing.  My inner environmentalist convulsed with frustration at wildlife being killed by unnecessary human waste, but my inner scientist screamed foul at the lack of direct evidence shown on the programme.  BBC Wildlife has been criticised before for passing off footage of captive animals as hard-won material taken in the wild. I have no problem with that if the facts are right and it makes striking educational TV, but this time it was fake – the linkages between the dead whale and plastic pollution were at best circumstantial. So I faced a dilemma: should I add to the clamour to restrict our wasteful use for plastic and to clean up our oceans, or call out the questionable editing and lack of facts? I chose to call it out via a personal tweet and it was picked up by a number of different media (Mailonline, the Daily Telegraph, The Sun). I certainly didn’t want to be sucked into any wider agendas that are more about bashing the BBC, but I still had a point.  Paul Jepson, a wildlife population health specialist based at the Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society London, mounted a defence. He said the plastic and toxic chemicals are capable of killing young whales and added that studies show the UK’s orca population, for example, has failed to breed successfully for 25 years, which correlates with that period’s high levels of contaminants.  “We already know that some chemical pollutants can cause the death of a new born calf,” he said. However, he also added that the camera team were unable to perform an autopsy on the calf featured in the programme. It’s a shame Attenborough’s voiceover couldn’t have articulated the right evidence to cut through the emotive presentation.  In the end, I’d rather not have found myself writing this article as I didn’t want exposing the production fakery to become the story. In fact, it seems that it hasn’t – the bigger story about plastic pollution has prevailed as the headline. Besides, we really do need emotive images and heart-rending story lines to impress on everybody the urgency of the plastic pollution issue.  The UK government has at least started to inch forward, but a promised ban on microplastics seems to be in the long grass. Other governments have moved forward, for example Costa Rica and Sri Lanka, who are already pressing on with restrictions on disposable (“single use”) plastic. Meanwhile, at least in his Budget, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, got as far as confirming that the government will launch a call for evidence on a “tax system” for single use plastics, such as food packaging. We are, however, less clear on the timescales for any action. So urgent action is needed and we need to keep up the pressure with good evidence. Please BBC, and Attenborough (long may he reign!), keep educating, keep going beyond the brilliant images and story lines into the big issues. Powerful environmental documentaries like Blue planet II can change views on the big environmental issues; just please use truth and scientific evidence."
"Pursuing economic growth at the expense of the environment is no longer an option as Europe faces “unprecedented” challenges from climate chaos, pollution, biodiversity loss and the overconsumption of natural resources, according to a report from Europe’s environmental watchdog. Europe was reaching the limits of what could be achieved by gradual means, by making efficiencies and small cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, with “transformational” change now necessary to stave off the impacts of global heating and environmental collapse, warned Hans Bruyninckx, executive director of the European Environment Agency.  “Marginal efficiency gains are not enough – they are not working to bring down emissions,” he said. “There is also a higher cost to marginal efficiency gains, if we keep investing in that. If we focus on making current technologies more efficient, there are limits. If we stick to what we know, it may seem easy but it doesn’t work in the long term.” The EEA scored 35 key measures of environmental health, from greenhouse gases and air pollution, waste management and climate change to soil condition and birds and butterfly species, and found only six in which Europe was performing adequately. “Incremental changes have resulted in progress in some areas but not nearly enough to meet our long-term goals,” said Bruyninckx. Further marginal changes would grow only more expensive, he predicted, making large-scale change necessary. “We already have the knowledge, technologies and tools we need to make key production and consumption systems such as food, mobility and energy sustainable.” Wholesale changes could include banning internal combustion engines and scaling up public transport, abandoning fossil fuels in favour of 100% renewable energy, stipulating that products must be designed and manufactured to create no waste, and changes to our diets and agricultural production. Environmental goals could not be seen as separate to or lesser than economic goals, and accepting environmental damage as an inevitable cost would lead to ecological collapse, Bruyninckx warned. The old system – of “continuing to promote economic growth and seeking to manage the environmental and social impacts” – would not deliver the EU’s long-term vision of “living well, within the limits of the planet”, the report warned. The report, known as European Environment – State and Outlook (SOER), is a comprehensive study produced every five years and details the health or otherwise of all natural systems across EU member states and others including Norway, Switzerland and Turkey. The 2020 edition was brought forward to inform the incoming European commission as they discuss a promised “green new deal”, and for delegates at COP25, the UN conference on climate change currently taking place in Madrid. There has been little improvement since the last report in 2015, despite promises, policies and targets, according to SOER 2020. Fewer than a quarter of protected species and only 16% of habitats are in a good state of conservation. Reduced pollution has improved water quality, but Europe will miss by a long way its goal of having a “good” rating for all water bodies by 2020. Though air quality has improved, about a fifth of the urban population live in areas where concentrations of pollutants exceed at least one EU air quality standard, and 62% of ecosystems are exposed to excessive nitrogen levels. Global heating has added to the risks to health. For instance, Bruyninckx pointed to the melting ice and permafrost in the far north as a little-considered danger. “Russia has buried some very toxic chemicals beneath the ice and we expect melting ice to release some of them,” he said. “Some chemicals are also sensitive to heat, so if we have more heatwaves that is a risk too.” Frans Timmermans, the incoming executive vice-president of the European commission, said: “In the next five years, we will put in place a truly transformative agenda, rolling out new clean technologies, helping citizens to adapt to new job opportunities and changing industries, and shifting to cleaner and more efficient mobility systems and more sustainable food and farming. There will be multiple benefits for Europeans if we get this right and our economy and our planet will be winners too.” Green campaigners called for urgent radical action. “Banning plastic straws and nudging renewable energy targets is no longer enough,” said Jagoda  Munić, director of Friends of the Earth Europe. “Only the boldest action to transform our consumption and growth-obsessed economy will do. Every decision [Ursula von der Leyen, the new European commission president] makes must put environment, climate and justice first.” Franziska Achterberg of Greenpeace added: “The new commission must follow [the EEA] advice and rethink the economic system that for decades has rewarded pollution, environmental destruction and human exploitation.”"

Share this...FacebookTwitterThere really are many scientists who dispute the alarmist conclusions of the climate scientists.
What follows is a scathing open letter from Japanese scientist and modeling expert Kyoji Kimoto to Dr. Syukuro Manabe, Dr. James Hansen and Dr. Robert Cess.
======================================
You are the lawbreakers in the court of science
by Kyoji Kimoto
9 January, 2016
Dear Dr. Syukuro Manabe, Dr. James Hansen and Dr. Robert Cess,
The anthropogenic global warming (AGW) theory of the IPCC is based on Manabe & Wetherald (1967) and Hansen et al., (1981) which utilize one dimensional radiative convective equilibrium model (1DRCM) with the fixed lapse rate assumption of 6.5K/km for 1xCO2 and 2xCO2, obtaining the zero feedback climate sensitivity of 1.2-1.3K.
However it is theoretically meaningless when the parameter sensitivity analysis is applied to the lapse rate for 2xCO2 as shown here.
Hansen himself admitted that 1DRCM is a fudge in an interview with Spencer Weart held on 23 October, 2000 at NASA as shown below. Here Dr. Hansen and his colleagues are referring to a paper by W. C. Wang et al., 1976: “Greenhouse Effects due to Man-Made Perturbations of Trace Gases” Science 194, 685-690.
An excerpt from the interview:
Weart:
This was a radiative convective model, so where’s the convective part come in. Again, are you using somebody else’s…
Hansen:
That’s trivial. You just put in…
Weart:
… a lapse rate…

Hansen:
Yes. So it’s a fudge. That’s why you have to have a 3-D model to do it properly. In the 1-D model, it’s just a fudge, and you can choose different lapse rates and you get somewhat different answers. So you try to pick something that has some physical justification. But the best justification is probably trying to put in the fundamental equations into a 3-D model.

Cess made a mathematical error in Cess (1976), Cess et al., (1989) and Cess et al., (1990) when differentiating his equation OLR=EeffxsigmaxTs^4,which can be detected by any high school student learning differentiation. Manabe and the IPCC AR4 adopted Cess method to obtain the zero feedback climate sensitivity (Planck response) =1.2K. The detailed discussions are here: http://multi-science.atypon.com/doi/abs/10.1260/0958-305X.26.6-7.1055
The AGW theory of the IPCC has caused huge economic losses to the world, including the collapse of British coal industry and the Fukushima nuclear disaster from the nuclear promotion policy of Japanese government to cut CO2 emissions. How will you take your responsibility for this?
As shown above, you are lawbreakers in the court of science. In the farewell lecture held on 26 October, 2001 in Tokyo, Manabe spoke about his research as follows:
Research funds have been $3 million per year and $120 million for the past 40 years. It is not clever to pursue the scientific truth. A better way is choosing the relevant topics to society for the funds covering the staff and computer cost of the project.”
Sincerely,
Mr. K. Kimoto

"The prospect of engineering the world’s climate system to tackle global warming is becoming more and more likely. This may seem like a crazy idea but I, and over 250 other scientists, policy makers and stakeholders from around the globe recently descended on Berlin to debate the promises and perils of geoengineering. There are many touted methods of engineering the climate. Early, outlandish ideas included installing a ‘space sunshade"": a massive mirror orbiting the Earth to reflect sunlight. The ideas most in discussion now may not seem much more realistic – spraying particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight, or fertilising the oceans with iron to encourage algal growth and carbon dioxide sequestration through photosynthesis. But the prospect of geoengineering has become a lot more real since the Paris Agreement. The 2015 Paris Agreement set out near universal, legally binding commitments to keep the increase in global temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and even to aim for limiting the rise to 1.5°C. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that meeting these targets is possible – but nearly all of their scenarios rely on the extensive deployment of some form of geoengineering by the end of the century. Geoengineering comes in two distinct flavours. The first is greenhouse gas removal: those ideas that would seek to remove and store carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The second is solar radiation management: the ideas that would seek to reflect a level of sunlight away from the Earth. Solar radiation management is the more controversial of the two, doing nothing to address the root cause of climate change – greenhouse gas emissions – and raising a whole load of concerns about undesirable side effects, such as changes to regional weather patterns.  And then there is the so-called “termination problem”. If we ever stopped engineering the climate in this way then global temperature would abruptly bounce back to where it would have been without it. And if we had not been reducing or removing emissions at the same time, this could be a very sharp and sudden rise indeed. Most climate models that see the ambitions of the Paris Agreement achieved assume the use of greenhouse gas removal, particularly bio-energy coupled with carbon capture and storage technology. But, as the recent conference revealed, although research in the field is steadily gaining ground, there is also a dangerous gap between its current state of the art and the achievability of the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Paris Agreement – and its implicit dependence on greenhouse gas removal – has undoubtedly been one of the most significant developments to impact on the field of geoengineering since the last conference of its kind back in 2014. This shifted the emphasis of the conference away from the more controversial and attention-grabbing solar radiation management and towards the more mundane but policy relevant greenhouse gas removal. But there were moments when sunlight reflecting methods still stole the show. A centrepiece of the conference was the solar radiation management experiments campfire, where David Keith and his colleagues from the Harvard University Solar Geoengineering Research Programme laid out their experimental plans. They aim to lift an instrument package to a height of 20km using a high-altitude balloon and release a small amount of reflective particles into the atmosphere. This would not be the first geoengineering experiment. Scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs have already begun experimenting with various ideas, several of which have attracted a great degree of public interest and controversy. A particularly notable case was one UK project, in which plans to release a small amount of water into the atmosphere at a height of 1km using a pipe tethered to a balloon were cancelled in 2013 owing to concerns over intellectual property. Such experiments will be essential if geoengineering ideas are to ever become technically viable contributors to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. But it is the governance of experiments, not their technical credentials, that has always been and still remains the most contentious area of the geoengineering debate.  Critics warned that the Harvard experiment could be the first step on a “slippery slope” towards an undesirable deployment and therefore must be restrained. But advocates argued that the technology needs to be developed before we can know what it is that we are trying to govern.  The challenge for governance is not to back either one of these extremes, but rather to navigate a responsible path between them. The key to defining a responsible way to govern geoengineering experiments is accounting for public interests and concerns. Would-be geoengineering experimenters, including those at Harvard, routinely try to account for these concerns by appealing to their experiments being of a small scale and a limited extent. But, as I argued in the conference, in public discussions on the scale and extent of geoengineering experiments their meaning has been subjective and always qualified by other concerns. My colleagues and I have found that the public have at least four principal concerns about geoengineering experiments: their level of containment; uncertainty around what the outcomes would be; the reversibility of any impacts, and the intent behind them. A small scale experiment unfolding indoors might therefore be deemed unacceptable if it raised concerns about private interests, for example. On the other hand, a large scale experiment conducted outdoors could be deemed acceptable if it did not release materials into the open environment. Under certain conditions the four dimensions could be aligned. The challenge for governance is to account for these – and likely other – dimensions of perceived controllability. This means that public involvement in the design of governance itself needs to be front and centre in the development of geoengineering experiments.  A whole range of two-way dialogue methods are available – focus groups, citizens juries, deliberative workshops and many others. And to those outside of formal involvement in such processes – read about geoengineering, talk about geoengineering. We need to start a society-wide conversation on how to govern such controversial technologies. Public interests and concerns need to be drawn out well in advance of an experiment and the results used to meaningfully shape how we govern it. This will not only make the the experiment more legitimate, but also make it substantively better. Make no mistake, experiments will be needed if we are to learn the worth of geoengineering ideas. But they must be done with public values at their core."
"That takeaway box that was in your hands for 10 minutes on Friday night could be in the ocean forever. Single use plastics are a real concern for the planet. The use and throwaway nature of items such as food packaging and drinks bottles means that millions of tons of plastic waste are created. Unfortunately, much of this can enter waterways and oceans.  This week, the UK Government will discuss the possibility of introducing taxes on single-use plastic items, such as bottles and takeaway containers, to try to reduce the amount of plastic pollution entering the oceans. This follows the successful introduction of the 5p plastic bag initiative in 2015 which reduced plastic bag use by 80%. This taxation on single-use plastics could be a major step towards improving the “plastic ocean” which humans have created. Studies showing entangled turtles, sea birds with stomachs full of plastic pieces and can holders cutting into the flesh of seals are shocking and clearly show the effect of plastics on marine life – but it doesn’t stop there. So, let’s imagine your Friday night takeaway box for a moment. If you are a careful consumer, you will have checked to see if it’s recyclable before throwing it in the bin. Unfortunately, many containers are not recyclable. Even some of those that are may be thrown into general waste if they have food residue on them that can’t be rinsed off. And how many people carry round washing-up liquid and a sponge on a Friday night anyway?  The excess of these containers enters the waste system due to the extreme amounts entering our waterways from land or through drainage systems. A study by the Rozalia Project that monitored storm drains in Boston Harbour found that a plastic item was released into the water every three seconds. Now imagine that takeaway box has made its way to sea via urban waterways, moving with the currents until it reaches the deep ocean. At this stage, your takeaway box is a megaplastic (items of plastic bigger that 10cm in size that stay intact for a long time). These plastics have been made to resist age and not break down easily. They can move around the planet, enter huge floating garbage patches, reach far flung beaches and become buried in sand and sediment. But these takeaway boxes and bottles don’t just stay as they were when we were using them. These containers slowly degrade and break down into macroplastics (2.5cm to 10cm), mesoplastics (5mm to 2.5cm), microplastics (smaller than 5mm) and sometimes even into nano particles (smaller than a micrometre, the equivalent of around 1/70th of the width of an average human hair). Depending on the size of your takeaway box, this can mean one box is turned into millions of pieces.  To get to this size, your takeaway box has been exposed to the sun, where UV degradation occurs.  The pounding action of the waves, which causes mechanical damage, helps to fragment the plastic.  Your takeaway box also becomes a home for many microbes which cause biodegradation of the plastic. As the plastic particles become less buoyant and covered in microorganisms, your takeaway box will sink, disappearing from the ocean surface into the depths. So, is this the last we see of your takeaway box? Unfortunately, no. At this stage, the box may be at its most dangerous. Now, these many individual pieces can be eaten by marine life large and small, even those in the deepest depths of the ocean. These microplastics have large surface area to volume ratios, which mean that they concentrate chemical toxins on their surfaces that then can transfer to the animals that eat them. This ingestion has been seen in multiple marine organisms and has led to a debate over whether these can lead to ecological effects both to the organism and any humans who consume them. What we do know, is that we need more research into how plastics degrade in the ocean and where they end up to fully understand what effect they may have on marine life.  So how much do you really care that your Friday night takeaway is being served in a plastic tray? Would it taste different if it was in a recycled cardboard container or even something as hipster as a bamboo tray? However you feel about this, without some action, you actually might end up eating your discarded takeaway box at some point in the future."
"A 250m-long, 130 tonne, “fatberg” was recently discovered clogging up the sewers below Whitechapel in east London. Fatbergs are made up of solidified fat and oils combined with wet wipes, nappies and sanitary products that are disposed of in sinks and toilets.  This wasn’t a unique find: another monstrous fatberg was found in a London suburb in 2013 and, a week after Whitechapel, a slightly smaller “berg” was found under the city’s Chinatown. No doubt there are many more fatbergs still out there, blocking up the sewage system and waiting to be discovered.  There is a simple way to avoid the build up of fatbergs and it relates to everything listed above: bin it, don’t flush it. But many people inevitably adopt the mentality of “out of sight out of mind” and assume it’s not their problem as someone else will sort it. The reality is that clogged-up sewers affect us all, sometimes even causing road closures and flooding.  The UK government has called on London to update its Victorian-era network of pipes and tunnels as, after heavy rainfall, lots of sewage is spilling out into the Thames. To help the capital’s creaky infrastructure cope with a growing population, Thames Water, the local utility, has started work on a huge £4.5 billion pipeline that will follow the river through the heart of the city.  But this entire model of large centralised sewers and treatment plants is already starting to look outdated. London’s sewers don’t just need updating – the city needs an entirely new approach to reducing the strain on its sewers. The key flaw to standard sewers systems is they combine all different kinds of waste into one big mixing pot of chemicals, bacteria and organic waste. A typical household, for instance, has one wastewater stream from the toilet which contains dangerous pathogens, another from the kitchen sink with food waste, and a third from the dishwasher which contains chemicals. All of these require different types of treatment before it is safe to put the water back into the environment.  It’s actually relatively easy to treat one specific highly-concentrated waste stream. Dishwasher waste, for instance, will be around eight to 15 litres of water containing a variety of chemicals to make your cutlery sparkle and, in this concentrated form, UV or ozone treatment can be used to easily remove 99% of them. But when dishwasher water is combined with all other sorts of waste it then creates a complex cocktail that is much more difficult to treat. Currently, the next step is to dilute everything with rainwater, which vastly increases the volume of water that needs all these elements removed. By the time the waste reaches the treatment plant, dangerous chemicals or substances may make up just one part in a billion of water particles. For instance, a typical sewage works may have to identify and remove just a single raindrop’s worth of benzene, a known carcinogen commonly found in laundry detergents, from a tank of toilet waste the size of a swimming pool. But if treatment was decentralised, with lots of smaller sewage works rather than one big one, most of the contaminants could be removed while they were still in high concentrations. This in turn means waste becomes more useful. Wastewater with lots of food and faeces contains high amounts of energy that can be extracted as “biomethane” gas which can be used for heating or cooking just like regular gas. But when this wastewater is combined with other sources, its energy content is diluted making it more difficult and less efficient to extract.  The solution is to build small treatment plants in new developments or renovations that service smaller areas. A variety of new technologies are being developed: some use electricity to combine different waste particles together into larger clumps so it can be extracted, while others use UV light to breakdown all the chemicals. Some designs let friendly bacteria breakdown the organic compounds producing methane or hydrogen, while others heat up the waste to extremely high temperatures turning it into a gas that can be used to produce electricity or to cook your dinner. Depending on the needs of the site they could focus on recovering energy or removing chemicals and they could be designed to produce different qualities of water depending on its final use. These small plants could be completely sealed to stop the smell escaping, and quick treatment times would avoid large amounts of smelly waste being stored near the communities. This way, waste wouldn’t need to travel for miles, mixing with other sources. Instead, it could be treated locally, providing both sustainable energy and clean water. Sewage networks were invented by the Victorians and ultimately changed society for the better. But everything evolves and improves with time, and Britain’s water infrastructure should be no exception."
" The 2019 Guardian and Observer charity appeal is all about trees: for what they are in themselves, in all their beauty and majesty, and for what they represent. This year, our theme is the climate emergency and our support goes to charities whose work is essential for the renewal of nature and the planet: not just planting new trees but protecting and restoring existing forest, woodland and other natural habitats in the UK and in the Amazon basin of South America. As Guardian and Observer readers, we hope you will have appreciated our comprehensive reporting on the causes of the climate crisis, from fossil-fuel burning and rainforest-clearing to pollution-emitting cars and planes. We’ve tracked the destructive consequences, including forest fires, melting ice caps, extreme weather events such as droughts and flash floods and filthy air. We’ve reported the evolving science of global heating and followed the emergence of a wave of youth-led eco-activism led by Greta Thunberg. We’ve covered the fight of environmental and land rights activists across the planet against ecologically destructive corporate and political interests.  We remain focused on the urgent giant policy steps that governments, businesses and consumers can and must take to avoid climate catastrophe. This year’s charity appeal highlights ways we as citizens can support practical, natural solutions to climate change. Planting and protecting trees is a positive way that we can help. Trees are vital in producing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They provide a natural habitat for animals, birds and insects and stem the decline of biodiversity. They can prevent flooding and soil erosion. They provide shelter and shade, and reduce air and noise pollution. Forests and woodlands are natural sources of beauty, wellbeing and peace. We are partnering with four fantastic charities: Global Greengrants Fund UK links social and environmental justice, providing resources for indigenous communities in the Amazon basin to help them peacefully protect their land rights from commercial encroachment and resist the destruction of precious rainforest. Woodland Trust plants millions of trees, creating new woods and forests in the UK as part of its Big Climate Fightback, while restoring and protecting existing ones from developers, pollution and disease. It manages and cares for 1,000 woods, each freely open to the public. Trees for Life aims to rewild thousands of hectares of the Scottish Highlands, providing natural solutions to the climate crisis while enabling native trees birds, mammals, trees and insects to thrive and flourish and creating a unique space for people to enjoy the healing power of wild nature. Trees for Cities works with local communities in socially deprived areas of the UK to plant trees in schools and parks, housing estates and woodlands. Its aim is to tackle the climate crisis, encourage social cohesion, improve air quality and beautify neglected urban spaces. In recent years, Guardian and Observer readers have raised millions through our annual appeal for topical causes that reflect our shared commitment to a fairer, more just society, from supporting refugees and campaigning against homelessness to fighting Windrush immigration injustices. The climate emergency – the most urgent issue of our time – felt to us to be a compelling choice for the 2019 appeal. Over the next few weeks, our website and newspapers will highlight the work of our charity partners. We hope we can inspire you to give generously and help protect the planet we share.

"Carbon dioxide emissions rose weakly this year as the use of coal declined but natural gas took up the slack, a comprehensive study of the global “carbon budget” has found. The rise in emissions was much smaller than in the last two years, but the continued increase means the world is still far from being on track to meet the goals of the Paris agreement on climate change, which would require emissions to peak then fall rapidly to reach net-zero by mid-century. Emissions for this year will be 4% higher than those in 2015, when the Paris agreement was signed. Governments are meeting this week and next in Madrid to hammer out some of the final details for implementing the Paris deal and start work on new commitments to cut emissions by 2030. But the new report shows the increasing difficulty of that task. Experts said it was much too early to take the slight slowdown in emissions growth this year as a sign the world was turning a corner in the climate emergency. Joeri Rogelj, a lecturer in climate change at the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, said: “CO2 emissions wiggle from year to year, but it is the long-term trend that is important. The small slowdown this year is really nothing to be overly enthusiastic about. If no structural change underlies this slowdown, science tells us that emissions will simply gradually continue to increase on average.” Such structural changes could include investment in renewable energy, low-carbon infrastructure, and plans to make buildings more energy efficient. “As long as global CO2 emissions are not embarking on a clear downward trajectory it is clear that we are not only continuing to make climate change worse, we’re doing it at a pace faster than ever before,” said Rogelj. Last week, a separate report found emissions would have to fall by 7.6% a year for the next 10 years to stay within the limits advised by scientists. Corinne Le Quéré, a research professor at the University of East Anglia who contributed to the Global Carbon Budget analysis, called for stronger policies from governments to phase out fossil fuels. “Current climate and energy policies are too weak to reverse trends in global emissions,” she said. “Policies have been successful to varying degrees in deploying low-carbon technologies, such as solar and wind power and electric vehicles. But these often add to existing demand for energy rather than displacing technologies that emit CO2, particularly in countries where energy demand is growing.” Emissions from coal burning dropped by about a 10th in the US and Europe, but oil use rose by about 0.9% and gas burning by about 2.6% globally. Glen Peters, research director at the Cicero Centre for International Climate Change Research and lead author of the Global Carbon Budget papers, which are published in the journals Nature Climate Change, Environmental Research Letters, and Earth System Science Data, said: “The weak growth in carbon dioxide emissions in 2019 was due to an unexpected decline in global coal use, but this drop was insufficient to overcome the robust growth in natural gas and oil consumption.” While coal use has declined in the US and Europe, new coal-fired power stations are still being planned in China, India and other countries; developed countries such as Japan are funding their construction overseas. Carbon from the burning of fossil fuels, from industrial processes and from cement manufacture increased by 0.6% in 2019, according to the provisional figures for the year. It was much slower growth than in recent years but still represented an increase. Emissions fell year-on-year by about 1.7% in the US and EU, but rose in China, the world’s biggest emitter, as well as in India and most of the rest of the world. Taken over the last 10 years, emissions have grown by an average of 0.9% a year. That is an improvement on the 3% a year that was the average for the 2000s, and emissions fell during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and reached a brief plateau from 2014 to 2016. However, broadly the pattern has still been an increase. In 2017, emissions grew by 1.5% and in 2018 by 2.1%. European leaders will make a fresh push to agree a target for a climate neutral EU by 2050, a leaked document has shown. The EU failed to agree an EU-wide 2050 target last June, after Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Estonia refused to join 24 countries in making the pledge. Estonia has since come on board, but the three other governments have not publicly agreed to the target, although officials hope they will agree, in exchange for funding in the next EU budget to help “green” their economies. The leaked council conclusions, seen by the Guardian, have been drafted ahead of an EU leaders’ summit next week. The document, which could change, also calls on the European commission to propose a revised EU climate target for 2030. The EU currently aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 (compared with 1990 levels), which campaigners say is woefully inadequate. Last week the European parliament called for a target of a 55% cut when it declared a climate emergency."

By Frank Bosse and Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
In November our sun was once again below normal in activity. The 84th month since the current solar cycle started in December 2008 saw a solar sunspot number (SSN) of 63.2, which was 72% of what is the mean for month 84 into a cycle since observations began in 1755.

Figure 1: Our current solar cycle (SC) 24 (red) compared to the mean cycle (blue) of the previous 23 cycles. The current cycle over the past year or so as been very similar to solar cycle number 5 (black) which occurred from 1798 to 1810.
What follows is a comparison of all cycles:

Figure 2: The accumulated monthly deviations anomaly from the mean value (blue curve in Figure 1) for each cycle.
The current solar cycle 24 is weak compared to the previous cycles beginning with solar cycle 18 (1945). The books are practically closed for the current cycle as it is not expected to become more active and activity is expected to trail off. We are experiencing the weakest solar cycle since the Dalton Minimum 1790-1830, which involved solar cycles 5, 6 and 7.

What’s ahead?
For estimating the solar sunspot activity of the next upcoming cycle, observing the polar fields during times of activity minima provides strong indications. We reported on this here. So what can we expect some three years before the awaited minimum?

Early indications of a modestly active solar cycle 25
Especially the south polar field (show in red in Figure 3) is beginning to show signs of strengthening a little, yet is still behind the values of the very active cycles that occurred during the second half of the 20th century. This could be an indication that solar cycle number 25 may not be much weaker than the current cycle, but also not stronger. We will know more in about 3 years.

Share this...FacebookTwitterI’ve reported earlier on Germany’s BARD 1 offshore engineering fiasco, where technical problems continue plaguing the wind park and has yet to deliver power on shore to reach markets. Even today the situation there remains unclear.
Moreover, just days I ago I reported how an expert institute confirmed that offshore wind park installations are highly vulnerable to the harsh sea conditions and plagued by stratospheric maintenance costs.
Well there is another major wind park that is now struggling with major technical problems and thus will not be able to deliver power until at least (optimistically) April. The giant offshore Riffgat wind park hasn’t delivered power since November of last year, so reports NDR German public broadcasting here. Hat-tip Gerti at FaceBook

According to NDR, the power supply has been interrupted due to a failed underwater power transmission cable that serves to deliver the power onshore. That means a loss of 7 million euros per month in revenue, which the consumers will have to pay because Germany’s feed-in act required power companies to pay for the electricity produced by win parks even if it is never delivered. If that sounds strange, it is so because the market-hostile law is the sort of thing one would find only in old communist regimes.
The NDR clip reports that the reason for the failed cable is unclear, and could be caused by an error during installation or during the production itself. The cable fault itself is 22 kilometers from the wind park, just east of Borkum Island. Normally repairing the cable would be a routine matter, but there’s one big problem:  the seabed is riddled by old WWII munitions, which first need to be removed before repair works can start.
The Riffgat website here says the wind park consists of 30 units 3.6 megawatt-class wind turbines located some 15 kilometer away from the North Sea island of Borkum near the Netherlands. Each wind turbine has a 120 meter rotor diameter and the hub height is 90 meters. The turbines are firmly anchored by 70-meter steel bases rammed 40 meters into the seabed.
The Riffgat wind park also has a transformer station that feeds the power to the seabed transmission cable, which in turn delivers the converted power on shore. The Riffgat wind park is operated by Oldenburg-based power company EWE.
The NDR clip reports that EWE is not really too concerned about the technical problem and that it is not receiving 7 million euros worth of power each month. This is so because grid and transmission cable operator Tenet is required to pay EWE the money whether the power gets delivered or not. And where is Tenet going to get that kind of money? You guessed it! The costs, like everything else with the German Energiewende, just get passed on to the lowly consumers.

Share this...FacebookTwitterOnce dismissed as something merely imagined by people close to industrial wind turbines, health disorders caused by infrasound are emerging as being very real.
Austrian site www.ots.at here has a press release by the Vienna Chamber of Physicians warning of health hazards from large-scale wind turbines, citing “comprehensive studies”. It calls for a minimum setback distance from built-up areas.
The OTS writes that noise from wind turbines is increasingly coming under the focus of scientific studies. Low frequency infrasound (< 20 Hz) was dismissed by wind energy proponents, but rapidly mounting evidence show the problem is more serious than first thought.
As part of the “International Noise Awareness Day” the Austrian Chamber of Physicians warns that today’s large size wind turbines have a blade diameter as large as a football pitch and a blade tip speed near 300 km/hr. They therefore create noise in the infrasound frequency range, which is known to cause health problems. Physician Piero Lercher of the Chamber of physicians: say:
Our target must be to prevent sleep disorder, psychological affects and irreversible damage to hearing from the noise such as that produced by wind turbines.”
The press release reports of increasing complaints stemming from low frequency infrasound and says studying the health impacts “is essential”.

Lercher adds that another component may be at play:
Perception disorders of persons living nearby are thought to be perhaps triggered by a ‘nocebo’ effect .”
Anti-wind energy group windwahn.de here thanks the physicians from Vienna for looking at the concerns of residents seriously, as many are ill and others are confronted by the threat of years of “acoustic torture” from proposed wind projects. Windwhn cites studies from all around the world and that it is time for Germany to wake up to this reality. The site writes:
We can no longer ignore the one third of residents in wind power regions who are sound injured and have serious health consequences!”

"The vast expanse of the Antarctic is a region of the world particularly vulnerable to climate change, where ice loss has the potential to significantly increase sea levels.  Now, for possibly the first time in 7,000 years, a phenomenon known as “upwelling” (the upward flow of warmer ocean water to the surface), is thought to have caused recent ice shelf collapse around the continent – and the glacial thinning associated with it.  Ice shelves floating on water are the oceanic extension of land glaciers and ice sheets, and the primary region for ice loss. As these shelves break apart, the flow of continental ice held up behind them accelerates. The ocean surrounding Antarctica is extremely cold, but water over 300m deep, Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW), is about 3⁰C above the melting point of ice. Normally, the very cold water above keeps this away from ice shelves. But in some areas, CDW is spilling onto the shallow Antarctic continental shelf, causing the ice to thin. Ice shelf thinning has accelerated in recent decades, but the picture is not the same everywhere. While the east of the Antarctic has shown modest gains in ice thickness, the west has outstripped this with significant ice loss – up to 18% in vulnerable areas like the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. The pattern of ice loss and other observations indicate that warmer water upwelling beneath these ice shelves is driving it. But what has caused this upwelling? Is it related to human activity? And how concerned should we be? Two teams led by scientists from the British Antarctic Survey, both of which I have been working with, set out to tackle these precise questions by focusing on two vulnerable areas. One site is in Pine Island Bay, in the Amundsen Sea, and the other is in Marguerite Bay, in the Bellingshausen Sea. The aims of the studies are similar – to monitor the extent of upwelling warm water onto the continental shelf over the past 10,000 years, in order to understand when this last occurred and what the impact was.  This involves collecting and sampling “cores” of sediment up to 10m long from the sea bed at a range of depths up to 900m. Obtaining suitable cores is particularly challenging in these remote locations, where glacial dynamics often disturb the sediment. Much of the evidence for past oceanography comes from tiny shells of amoeboid organisms called foraminifera. A huge variety of species colonise habitats on the sea floor and make up much of the sediment collected. There can be hundreds of shells in just one gram of sediment. Forams are extremely valuable, as their shells are made of calcium carbonate precipitated from the ocean water in which they lived. Examining these shells allows us to reconstruct the chemistry of ocean water.  There were two geochemical tracers used for warm CDW in Pine Island Bay – the proportion of carbon isotopes, and the magnesium to calcium ratio controlled by water temperature. Both of these showed CDW was last on the inner shelf over 7,500 years ago. In Marguerite Bay, shells of another plankton group called diatoms were also analysed. These indicate past productivity and sea surface temperatures. They showed that CDW was persistently on the shelf here over 7,000 years ago, and more sporadically since then. Tellingly, the enhanced upwelling of warm CDW in both locations negatively impacted the local extent of ice.  Both studies suggest that the cause of the CDW upwelling before 7,000 years ago was a more southerly position of the southern hemisphere westerly winds (SHWW). These winds are thought to drive circulation of the warmer deep water. A recent shift in the position of the SHWW towards the poles could be the cause of greater CDW upwelling in Pine Island Bay since the 1940s.  This coincidence of timing with the onset of industrialisation shows it is possible that human made greenhouse gasses, thought to cause atmospheric warming, are having an impact on the position of the winds, the increase in warm water reaching the surface, and ultimately the melting of more ice in the Antarctic. Irrespective of the causes of past changes in SHWW positions, the link between winds and ocean upwelling is cause for concern, as future projected global warming may shift SHWW belts and promote further upwelling and melting. More research is now needed to fully understand the link between CDW and past climate, and to estimate the strength of upwelling since the 1940s compared to upwelling before 7,000 years ago. But the emerging picture is one of the potentially increased vulnerability of West Antarctic ice sheets, and possible future sea level rise."

Share this...FacebookTwitterLeading German Green Party official Volker Beck has resigned from “several of his posts” amid charges of illegally possessing the drug crystal meth.
Berlin authorities allegedly caught the high-profile politician early this month. He has not yet resigned from his post as a parliamentary member of the Bundestag.
German online weekly FOCUS reports today that Beck told police “the banned substance was not for himself, but for someone else“, thus possibly opening himself up to drug dealing charges.
Frankly I find it peculiar and somewhat telling that the uproar over the affair has been comparatively low-key, giving the impression that Green politicians routinely get off easy whenever involved in scandal.
DW German public radio even went so far as to accuse center right tabloid Bild of being “gleeful” over breaking the news of Beck’s drug possession arrest, writing here that the newspaper “was not slow to drag the politician over its own moral coals, splashing the headline ‘Green caught with Hitler drug!’ on its front page – a reference to the Nazi leader’s regular use of methamphetamines.”
Green Party’s pedophile past
Surprisingly DW reports that Beck used to be a proponent of legalizing sexual contact with children:
In 2013, he raised a furor in Germany when he called for decriminalizing sexual contact with children.”
In the early days of Germany’s Green Party, 1980s and 1990s, the founders loudly called for the legalization of sex with underage children. The Greens‘ advocacy of pedophilia rights was part of the party’s platform as it pushed neo-liberal ideas like “free and open relationships”.

Thomas Birk, Green Party Berlin parliamentarian and author of a commissions report investigating the scandal, mentioned in March, 2015, that there had been “up to 1000 victims”.
Green Party Chairwoman Bettina Jarasch publicly apologized for what she called an “institutional failure”. She said: 
On behalf of the Berlin Greens, we ask for forgiveness.”
According to the Berlin based left-leaning Tagesspiegel here, the investigation and commission report shed light into an “abuse network” within the forerunner of the Green party, the Alternativen Liste, which included at least three leading figures who set up a “youth center” in a Kreuzberg recreational center.
According to witnesses, they abused numerous youths who had been recruited at elementary schools.“
Brown roots
The Green movement has also come under scrutiny and suspicion for its brownish “blood and soil” environmentalist roots and its thinly veiled contempt for the human species. Recently television producer and director Martin Durkin wrote a meticulously researched essay on the roots of the green movement titled:  “NAZI GREENS – An Inconvenient History”.

Share this...FacebookTwitterDave Burton of  SeaLevel.info site here deserves widespread, world-wide exposure.
Hat-tip: Kenneth Richard
The site allows user-friendly observation of sea level rise trends at locations across the world using spreadsheet data direct from NOAA and PSMSL, as it is designed to be similar to Paul Clark’s popular interactive temperature graph site (woodfortrees.org).
Sea levels rising less than half as fast, no acceleration!
Stunningly, contrary to the claims of the modeled reconstructions of sea level rise (with “adjustments” added), actual physical measurements indicate that sea levels are rising at rates well less than half the claimed rates when including GIA “adjustments” and satellite altimetry modeled reconstructions.
The best estimate is a median global mean sea level value of 1.48 mm/yr, or less than 6 inches per century.
SeaLevel.info is a one-stop source for sea-level information. The spreadsheets consolidate data from NOAA, PSMSL and other sources, to simplify examination of tide-gauge data for long term sea-level trend analysis.
The site writes:
One interesting observation is that GIA (PGR)† adjustments are often nearly as large as the averaged actual measured sea-level trends! The average of the measured trends for NOAA’s 2012 set of 239 tide gauges is 1.017 mm/year (median 1.280), but the GIA adjustments add an average of 0.665 mm/year, giving a total “adjusted” average trend of 1.682 mm/year, which rounds to 1.7 mm/year, which happens to exactly equal a very widely-quoted figure for 20th century sea-level rise.”
The site here also writes that sea level is not rising everywhere, and:

The measured rate of coastal sea-level change varies from -17.59 mm/yr at Skagway, Alaska to +9.39 mm/yr at Kushiro, Japan. The average, as measured by the world’s best long-term coastal tide gauges, is just under +1.5 mm/yr (about 6 inches per century).”
Satellite altimetry
SeaLevel.info wonders about the often ballyhooed figures of 3.3 mm/yr (13 inches per century), based on satellite altimetry measurements of sea-level, rather than coastal sea-level measured by tide gauges. It writes that satellite altimeters “measure the wrong thing”:
Their measurements are distorted by “sea-level rise” caused by thermal expansion when the upper layer of the ocean warms. But that is a strictly local effect, that doesn’t affect the quantity of water in the oceans, and doesn’t affect sea-level elsewhere (e.g., at the coasts).  Sea-level rise only matters at the coasts, but satellite altimeters are incapable of measuring sea-level at the coasts. They can only measure sea-level in the open ocean. Tide gauges measure sea-level at the coasts, where it matters. Also, tide gauge measurements of sea-level are much higher quality than satellite altimetry measurements.
SealLevel.info adds that “satellite measurements of sea-level are of questionable reliability, and vary considerably from one satellite to another” and that tide gauges are more reliable because “some of the tide-gauge records of sea-level measurements are nearly ten times as long as the combined satellite measurement record, and twenty times as long as any single satellite measurement record.”
According to SeaLevel.info, the NOAA has done linear regression analysis on sea-level measurements (relative sea-level) from 225 long term tide gauges around the world, and found that “there’s been no sign of any acceleration (increase in rate) in most of those tide-gauge records, in over three-quarters of a century.”
The site summarizes:
The rate of measured sea-level rise (SLR) varies from -17.59 mm/yr at Skagway, Alaska, to +9.39 mm/yr at Kushiro, Japan. 197 of 225 stations (87.6%) have recorded less than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise. At 47 of 225 stations (20.9%) sea level is falling, rather than rising. Just 28 of 225 stations (12.4%) have recorded more than 3.3 mm/yr sea-level rise. The average SLR at those 225 gauges is +0.90 mm/yr. The median is +1.41 mm/yr.
MSL = 1.48 mm/yr

In fact this year we should expect US hurricanes to very likely play a crucial role in the US presidential elections, especially amid the climate change hysteria within the mainstream media and Democrat alarmist politicians. Recall what happened in 2012.
Strongest in over 4 years
Former NOAA meteorologist David Dilley of Global Weather Oscillations (GWO) says the 2016 and 2017 Atlantic hurricane seasons will be the strongest in over 4 years, and have the most United States hurricane landfalls since 11 were experienced during the destructive seasons of 2004 and 2005.
GWO has issued the most accurate predictions of any organization over the past 7 years, and says that unlike the past three hurricane seasons, which were dominated by hostile atmospheric conditions that subdued hurricane activity, the next few years will be in a “Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle” that will provide very favorable conditions for development of tropical storms and hurricanes.
The Atlantic Basin Hurricane Season runs from June 1 to December 1, and on the average has 12 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 or 3 major hurricanes. The 2015 hurricane season officially ended with 11 named storms, 4 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes. Hurricane Alex formed on January 14th of this year, only 6 weeks following the official ending of the 2015 season – but nearly 5 months prior to the beginning of the 2016 hurricane season. Alex was officially called the first hurricane of the 2016 Hurricane Season, based on the January to December Gregorian January – not the natural climate and weather calendar that drives development of tropical storms during a season.
But with Hurricane Alex being more closely attached to the 2015 into early 2016 El Niño and the climate season – this means the 2015 hurricane season actually had 1 additional named storm and hurricane. This brings the total for the 2015 season up to 12 named storms and 5 hurricanes, which is very close to the long term average of 12 named storms and 6 hurricanes.
El Niños normally suppress hurricanes, but…

The numbers for the 2015 season are very important when it comes to predicting the upcoming hurricane seasons. The occurrence of an El Niño during a hurricane season typically suppresses the number of named storms significantly – but it did not in 2015 – and this is a signal for what is in-store the next few seasons.
CEO David Dilley of GWO says the combination of the El Niño ending before the 2016 hurricane season, and the high number of named storms (12) connected to the 2015 season, signals that a “Climate Pulse Hurricane Enhancement Cycle” is now in place, and this will provide very favorable atmospheric conditions for hurricane development and landfalls during the next couple of years.
Most dangerous and costly in over 10 years
Mr. Dilley predicts the upcoming 2016 and 2017 seasons will be much stronger than the past three seasons, and it will likely be the most dangerous and costly period in over 10 years. The 2016 season will have 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes. Three of the GWO United States prediction zones are at high risk for hurricane conditions in 2016. One of the zones has a high risk for a major impact hurricane. The 2017 season will be more dangerous and costly than 2016, with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 5 major hurricanes, and several of the GWO prediction zones will be at high risk for major impact hurricanes. Over the two year period, GWO expects 5 to 8 United States Hurricane Hot Spots.
Models predict hurricanes 2 to 3 years in advance
GWO is the only organization that issues detailed preseason predictions two years into the future for 11 United States prediction zones from New England to Texas. GWO’s predictions have been the most accurate of any organization the past 7 years, and GWO is the only organization that predicted the occurrence of Hurricane Ike (2008), Irene (2011), and Sandy (2012). Hurricanes Irene and Sandy were predicted 2 to 3 years in advance.
What makes GWO standout from other organizations is their commitment to research and development of GWO’s “Climate Pulse Technology” (CPT). The CPT prediction model incorporates natural mechanisms that control the rhythm of weather and climate cycles, which in-turn control future hurricane paths. Research over the past 30 years has found that each of the Atlantic and Gulf coastal zones have different weather cycles, and within each cycle, there exists smaller weather cycles which make each zone unique. Once all of the cycles are discovered, GWO then uses the Climate Pulse Technology to accurately assess the intensity of a future hurricane seasons, and the probability risk for hurricane or tropical storm conditions within a prediction zone for that year.
GWO Webinars, detailed hurricane zone predictions, prediction performance over the past 7 years, graphics, and the “free” climate change e-book “Earth’s Natural Climate Pulse” (authored by David Dilley) can be acquired through the Global Weather Oscillatlions web site. In addition, an interactive electronic subscription to the GWO’s hurricane predictions can also be acquired through GWO’s working partner XtremeGIS the risk management division of the Wall Street Network.
87% accuracy
When GWO predicts a high probability for hurricane conditions within one of their prediction zones, it is red-flagged as a hurricane or tropical storm “Hot Spot”. GWO’s hot spot predictions for the United States have been nearly 87 percent accurate since 2006, and instrumental for long-range planning by companies and other organizations. GWO is the only organization that predicts hurricane conditions for specific zones, and for up to 4 years in advance. Detailed predictions for the 11 hurricane zones can be obtained by going to the Global Weather Oscillations web site.

"To fight climate change and meet the Paris Agreement targets the world will need to rapidly switch from fossil fuels to renewable or nuclear energy. According to the International Energy Agency, this will require up to US$5 trillion (£3.7 trillion) of new investment by 2040.  There’s always lots of talk about how much this will cost and whether low-carbon electricity can still be cheap for consumers. But the flip side to every cost is a revenue – and what has received less attention is the size of the opportunity that will be created for green growth and new investment. To figure this out, we need to explore which “mixes” of technology would meet decarbonisation targets. In some UK scenarios, for instance, existing fossil fuel power stations would be converted to capture and store their carbon emissions, while others involve a complete renewal of the whole sector through bottom-up, localised energy systems.  Modelling and scenario building is a great way to test out possible futures without having to experiment with the whole electricity system in real time. But, while they can tell us a lot about what technology is required and what it will cost, these scenarios don’t say very much about what kind of value new energy systems will create and for whom.   This is where our research comes in. Together with colleagues, we have analysed how new markets are created and destroyed within these UK electricity system scenarios. These new markets include large-scale low-carbon generation, such as offshore wind or new nuclear power stations, and the provision of new services, such as charging infrastructure for electric vehicles.  Our work shows that in these new markets electricity utilities could access up to £21 billion per year of new value by 2050. In context, that would be worth up to 30% of the total energy market that year.  Understanding how the transition to low-carbon energy might cause certain sectors to grow or shrink is important because, first, it helps utilities plan for the future. Our work shows that large-scale low-carbon generation, for example offshore wind, could be worth up to £8 billion annually by 2050. However, in scenarios in which electricity demand is met through decentralised, smaller-scale systems, big offshore wind farms are needed much less. In that scenario the market would be worth less than £1 billion per year.  Second, focusing always on “cost” as opposed to “opportunity” misses the critical point that new investment leads to new jobs and technological innovation. If the UK focuses on offshore wind or solar, for instance, it would need a plan for when the wind doesn’t blow or the sun doesn’t shine. This would mean a big boost for the “flexibility” market, which includes everything from batteries to services which encourage people to use energy at certain times. In a high-renewables future, it could be worth more than £1 billion per year. But if the UK instead goes for large carbon capture plants, the flexibility market will be worth almost nothing. Finally, by demonstrating how different markets are created and destroyed in different energy futures, we can better understand the effects of energy policy on market creation. The UK is leading the world in the development of offshore wind power, as shown by a dramatic fall in the cost of government subsidies. Rather than focus on lowest total cost, this type of analysis shows how government can make policies which both achieve low-carbon ambitions and foster new export sectors. This requires innovation policy as well as subsidy support and new environmental regulation.  By calculating the “size of the prize” in clean energy futures our work shows that up to £21 billion of new value is available – but new value for whom? Clean energy policy cannot simply be about developing new technology. The value created by the UK’s offshore wind farms, nuclear power plants or carbon capture needs to flow towards its citizens, while export opportunities in offshore wind and storage technologies are maximised."
"As expected, the first episode of Sir David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II has been greeted with rapturous applause. But alongside the gasps of delight at the beauty of the natural world, the programme came with an urgent message for viewers which we can no longer afford to ignore. Produced by the BBC’s Natural History Unit in partnership with the Open University, and narrated by the world’s favourite natural historian, the series revisits The Blue Planet after a gap of 16 years. The series does what the BBC’s Natural History Unit does best – films the natural world in a fresh and compelling way using the latest technology. Blue Planet II allows the audience to get up close and personal to an array of extraordinary creatures that depend on and harness Earth’s vast oceans for their survival. From the depths of the abyss where sunlight is absent and the pressure immense, to the wild rapidly changing coast, viewers are introduced to a variety of habitats and privy to remarkable behaviours, some of which have never been filmed before. The series is based around five ocean habitats, exploring the world of the animals that live there and the threats they face. There are many filming firsts: the ingenious tusk fish which uses rocks as an anvil to smash clam shells; co-operative hunting between bottlenose dolphins and false killer whales; as well as a giant trevally fish that hunts terns by plucking them out of the air. All that and sealions hunting as a co-ordinated pack, driving 60kg tuna into the shallows; as well as coral grouper and reef octopus hunting together and communicating using gestures – a behaviour usually associated with apes. There are also behaviours that are new to science, such as an octopus that covers itself with shells to create a suit of armour to deter predators and female cuttlefish that flash a white stripe to indicate to amorous males an unwillingness to mate. Some of these uncovered behaviours demonstrate an intelligence that has been vastly underestimated.  As academic consultants on the series, we were captivated by the footage that leads viewers into this largely unexplored world from the perspective of the creatures that live there, capturing fascinating behaviour in exquisite detail. But working on it also made us acutely aware how much humans and the planet stand to lose if we fail to recognise and acknowledge the negative impact we are having on the oceans. And it is this awareness which makes the timing of Blue Planet II so important. By revealing the awe-inspiring nature of the oceans in a way the audience can connect with emotionally, Blue Planet II raises critical awareness of the immediate threats facing our oceans and underscores what we stand to lose by ignoring them.  Scientific research now overwhelmingly demonstrates that the ocean is changing. Sea surface temperatures have increased, levels of dissolved oxygen are declining, sea water has become more acidic and food supplies have declined. The consequences are uncertain in their details but the rapidity and breadth of changes means that they will be profound. Recent research suggests that more than half the world’s oceans could suffer these multiple effects of rising carbon dioxide level over the next 15 years. By mid-century it is possible that more than 80% of oceans could be affected, forcing its inhabitants to migrate, adapt, or in some cases, face extinction. It’s happening already. Huge swaths of coral reefs around the world have bleached in recent years, and two-thirds of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef is affected by coral bleaching. Seagrass meadows, kelp beds and mangrove forests are some of the most productive habitats on earth, storing vast amounts of carbon – but are also some of the most threatened. In 2015 and 2016 the worst instance of mangrove forest die-off ever recorded occurred off the Australian coast. And that is not all. The oceans are facing a major threat from pollution – by 2050 it is predicted that without significant action there will be more plastic in the oceans than fish. It is estimated that between 4-12m metric tons of plastic makes its way into the oceans each year. Nearly 700 marine species  have been found entangled in plastic, and an increasing number – from microscopic plankton to whales – ingest it, compromising their ability to digest food, maintain body condition and give birth to healthy young. Persistent organic pollutants have been found 10km down in the Mariana trench, and are ingested by organisms that live there. This is the more serious message that the series addresses alongside its spellbinding footage, particularly in the final episode that explores the struggle many species experience in the face of environmental change caused by humans. But, there is also a message of hope. Now we understand more fully the consequences of our actions we can act to stop or at least slow them. Some of the initiatives aimed at mitigating the damage humans have inflicted are highlighted in the final episode. For example, overfishing in the 1950s resulted in the collapse of Norway’s herring stock, but better regulation and scientific monitoring has led to a spectacular recovery in numbers. Today, there is enough herring for both humans and the hundreds of humpback whales and orcas that feed on them. Ultimately though, keeping our oceans healthy and functioning properly will require bold leadership, motivation and coordinated effort on a global scale.  As Sir David Attenborough succinctly puts it: “For the first time in 500m years, one species has the future in its hands.”"
"Politicians are getting very excited about planting millions of trees to curb climate change, but there is little mention of the peatlands of Britain. Peatlands may not be as glamorous as forests, but they store far more carbon dioxide. They occupy about 12% of the UK’s land area and store 5.5bn tonnes of carbon, over half of the entire country’s current carbon storage.  Compare that with our forests, which store 150m tonnes of carbon, although forests grow faster, and absorb carbon faster, than peatlands. And peatlands become part of the climate problem by giving off CO2 when they dry out, caused by drainage for farming or other developments. Restoring peat moors may be a relatively inexpensive way of tackling climate change, by blocking up drainage ditches and bringing back vegetation to the moors. In a report this July, the government’s Office for National Statistics estimated that fully restoring the UK’s lost peatlands could cost between £8bn and £22bn over the next 100 years. But it predicted savings of £109bn in terms of reduced carbon emissions. And there are other advantages to healthy peatlands. They provide more than 25% of the UK’s drinking water, and also help to control flooding by soaking up heavy rainfalls and releasing the water more gradually."
"The scheduling of Tokyo 2020 Olympic events at Fukushima is being seen as a public relations exercise to dampen fears over continuing radioactivity from the reactor explosion that followed the massive earthquake six years ago. It brings to mind the British atomic bomb tests in Australia that continued until a month before the opening of the 1956 Olympic Games in Melbourne – despite the known dangers of fallout travelling from the testing site at Maralinga to cities in the east. And it reminds us of the collusion between scientists and politicians – British and Australian – to cover up the flawed decision-making that led to continued testing until the eve of the Games. Read more: Sixty years on, the Maralinga bomb tests remind us not to put security over safety  Australia’s prime minister Robert Menzies agreed to atomic testing in December 1949. Ten months earlier, Melbourne had secured the 1956 Olympics even though the equestrian events would have to be held in Stockholm because of Australia’s strict horse quarantine regimes. The equestrians were well out of it. Large areas of grazing land – and therefore the food supplies of major cities such as Melbourne – were covered with a light layer of radiation fallout from the six atomic bombs detonated by Britain during the six months prior to the November 1956 opening of the Games. Four of these were conducted in the eight weeks running up to the big event, 1,000 miles due west of Melbourne at Maralinga. In the 25 years I have been researching the British atomic tests in Australia, I have found only two mentions of the proximity of the Games to the atomic tests. Not even the Royal Commission into the tests in 1985 addressed the known hazards of radioactive fallout for the athletes and spectators or those who lived in the wide corridor of the radioactive plumes travelling east. At the time, the approaching Olympics were referred to only once in the Melbourne press in relation to the atomic tests, in August 1956. It is known that D-notices from the government “requesting” editors to refrain from publishing information about certain defence and security matters were issued. The official history of the tests by British nuclear historian Lorna Arnold, published by the UK government in 1987 and no longer in print, reports tests director William Penney signalling concern only once, in late September 1956:  Am studying arrangements firings but not easy. Have Olympic Games in mind but still believe weather will not continue bad. This official history doesn’t comment on the implications. And nowhere in the 1985 Royal Commission report is there any reference to the opening of the Olympics, just one month and a day after the fourth test took place 1,000 miles away. The 1984 report of the Expert Committee on the review of Data on Atmospheric Fallout Arising from British Nuclear Tests in Australia found that the methodology used to estimate the numbers of people who might have been harmed by this fallout at fewer than 10 was inappropriate. And it concluded that if the dose calculations were confined to the communities in the path of the fallout and not merged with the total Australian population “such an exercise would generate results several orders of magnitude higher than those based on conventional philosophy”. There was no mention of the Olympic Games. Neither Prime Minister Menzies nor his cabinet ever referred publicly to what had been known from the outset – that the British atomic tests in Australia would almost coincide with the Melbourne Olympics. The tests and the Games were planned simultaneously through the first half of the 1950s. In May 1955, 18 months before the Olympics were due to start, Howard Beale, the Australian minister for supply, announced the building of “the Los Alamos of the British Commonwealth” (a nuclear test site in New Mexico) at Maralinga, promising that “tests would only take place in meteorological conditions which would carry radioactive clouds harmlessly away into the desert”. An Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee was formed by the Australians but was closely controlled by physicist Professor Ernest Titterton, the only Englishman on the panel. The 1985 Royal Commission stated explicitly that the AWTSC was complicit in the firing of atomic detonations in weather conditions that they knew could carry radioactive fallout a thousand miles from Maralinga to eastern cities such as Melbourne. Professor Titterton, who had recently been appointed to a chair in nuclear physics at the Australian National University after working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, and at Aldermaston in England, explained why the atomic devices were being tested in Australia: Because of the hazards from the radioactivity which follows atomic weapons explosions, the tests are best carried out in isolated regions – usually a desert area … Most of the radioactivity produced in the explosion is carried up in the mushroom cloud and drifts downward under atmospheric airstreams. But particular material in this cloud slowly settles to the ground and may render an area dangerously radioactive out to distances ranging between 50 and several hundred miles … It would therefore be hazardous to explode even the smallest weapons in the UK, and it was natural for the mother country to seek test sites elsewhere in the Commonwealth. The AWTSC published two scientific papers in 1957 and 1958 which flat out denied that any dangerous levels of radioactivity reached the eastern states. But their measurements relied on a very sparse scattering of sticky paper monitors – rolls of gummed film set out to catch particles of fallout – even though these could be washed off by rain. Despite their clear denials in these papers, meteorological records show that prior to the Games there was rain in Melbourne which could have deposited radioactivity on the ground. The AWTSC papers included maps purporting to show the plumes of radioactive  fallout travelling north and west from Maralinga in the South Australian desert. The Royal Commission published expanded maps (see page 292) based on the AWTSC’s own data and found the fallout pattern to be much wider and more complex. The Australian scientist Hedley Marston’s study of radioactivity uptake in animals showed a far more significant covering of fallout on a wide swathe of Australian grazing land than indicated by the sticky paper samples of the AWTSC. The 1985 Royal Commission report into British Nuclear Tests in Australia discussed many of these issues, but never in relation to the proximity and timing of the 1956 Olympic Games. Sixty years later, are we seeing the same denial of known hazards six years after the reactor explosion at Fukushima?"
"A climate change “lens” will now be applied to all major decisions made by the government, New Zealand’s climate change minister has said, as floods and bushfires wreck havoc around the country in the first week of summer. Minister James Shaw said cabinet “routinely” considers the effects of its decisions on human rights, the Treaty of Waitangi, rural communities, the disability community, and gender.  Now climate change will become a standard part of cabinet’s decision-making too, in a week in which the country has being battered by extreme weather events in both the North and South islands. “Decisions we take now and in the future about everything from the places we live, to how we get around, to public health, to how we relate to one another will be impacted one way or another by climate change. It’s crucial therefore that when we’re making big decisions climate change is at the forefront of our minds,” Shaw said in a statement. He said a ‘climate impacts assessment’ will be mandatory for proposals that are designed to reduce emissions, or which are likely to have an impact on greenhouse emissions greater than 250,000 tonnes a year. The Ministry for the Environment has developed a tool that can be used to estimate emissions impacts, and its effectiveness will be reviewed in mid-2020, Shaw said. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has called the climate emergency her generation’s “nuclear free moment” and made tackling it a priority for her coalition government. Last month cabinet passed the zero-carbon bill, committing to reduce emission to net-zero by 2050. The government has also banned new offshore oil and gas exploration permits, committed to planting a billion trees by 2028, and told farmers to cut emissions by 2025 or face higher taxes. Greenpeace spokesperson Gen Toop welcomed the move but urged more action. “We really need to see more tangible policy action that will slash emissions now, especially those from the country’s biggest emitter, agriculture,” Toop said. “We need to cut emissions now. In order to do that the government must regulate industrial dairying by phasing out synthetic fertiliser use and capping cow numbers. It must support significant new wind and solar generation to power our homes, transport and economy, and it must cancel OMV’s oil and gas exploration permits,” Toop said, in reference to a fossil fuel company that has a permit to explore New Zealand’s waters. The opposition climate change spokesperson, Scott Simpson, said the announcement was a “well-meaning initiative” but how it was implemented would be the real test. “It shouldn’t just be another level of bureaucracy for decisions to go through,” he said. The environment ministry said the effects of climate change were already being recorded in New Zealand, including sea-level rise, warming ocean temperatures and hotter summers. Longer-term, the ministry said the country will experience hotter annual temperatures nationwide, more severe weather, coastal erosion due to sea-level rise, increasingly frequent flooding and higher levels of human and animal mortality."
"The latest UN Climate Change Conference since the 2015 Paris Agreement is taking place in Bonn between November 6-17 – and the world will be watching. The conference will be presided over by the government of Fiji, a country that is no stranger to the devastation that climate change brings.  At first glance, modern Fiji’s narrative follows a recognisable storyline: vanishing islands, a culture slipping away, and a people unsure of what their future holds. It tells a familiar tale of vulnerable villages in fear of rising tides and residents as victims on the frontline of climate change.  Stories help us to share facts, knowledge and experiences about the causes and effects of a changing world. Yet they are more than just educational tools, they also shape our lives and help define us. From the news to Game of Thrones, stories hold the immense ability to alter what we do and do not see. They do this by activating and exciting the neural pathways in our brains that form the basis for our actions.  According to doomsday narratives about climate change, such as the one about Fiji, communities are neither empowered nor resilient, nor do they hold much agency over their future. When we constantly see stories about communities in crisis as sea levels rise and extreme weather events become more frequent, we come away with notions that there is no hope – the future is presented as an ominously uncertain but seemingly inevitable defeat.  Yet, such doomsday narratives are counterproductive, dangerous … and wrong. We can survive climate change. There is something simple and concrete that each of us can do. Telling and sharing stories, from the scientific to the personal, is one of our most important tools. However, they are different stories than the Fijian one. Energy+Illawarra is a community-oriented, interdisciplinary, strategic social intervention programme. Engineers, geographers, and marketers work together to improve energy efficiency in the homes of low-income, older people in Illawarra, a region in New South Wales, Australia.  Ultimately, humankind must rapidly decarbonise the environment to avoid dangerous climate change. Being more efficient with energy is an effective way to do that. This project has that message at its heart. First, the energy use and attitudes towards energy efficiency of 830 households in the community were measured. Then, a series of 11 focus groups with 59 participants from the community were carried out to collect their stories relating to energy efficiency. These stories were then used to help develop ten short films that bust participants’ misconceptions and myths about everyday energy use and provide strategies on how to use energy more efficiently.  Each film features audiovisual footage of real project participants telling their stories and focuses on the energy use of an everyday household appliance, from fridge freezers and lighting to the washer dryer.  Following the development of these films, we assessed their efficacy. We conducted cognitive neuroscientific research using electroencephalography (EEG) to identify brain wave activity associated with watching these films. The experiment involved people watching the films while they were attached to the EEG equipment that measured their neural response to the stories. Sixteen people from the community participated in the experiment. All the study participants watched the same films in random order, while undergoing the EEG scans. The results showed heightened activity in areas of the brain associated with empathising with the story characters as well as imagination of, attention for, and memorising of the story plot. These mental processes are involved in spurring our brains into action.  Brain response was especially strong for the fridge freezer film, which featured a real project participant telling stories about his fridge, followed by animations providing technical advice and guidance on energy efficiency.  This household appliance has been associated with the visceral nervous system and deep inward feelings, because it stores a basic need: food. We already knew that engaging stories can put you in another person’s shoes in a figurative sense. The fridge freezer film suggests that watching an engaging story can also transport you into the “body” of an object.  The films have been extensively distributed through the project website, social media, and special LCD brochures that were sent to households as well as community and health centres across regional New South Wales, Australia. Afterwards, the energy use and attitudes towards energy efficiency of the same community households as before were measured again. The findings showed that the films have begun to reduce energy use in the community and change the climate change narrative, with meter reading data revealing that energy use dropped by between 0.45% to 22.5%, depending on the type of household. Instead of presenting a narrative of helpless climate change victims and an inevitable future of defeat, these films tell stories that bust misconceptions and myths about everyday energy use and provide strategies and support for using energy efficiently. Take a look to see just how easy it is to make a difference. Let’s rewire our brains and act. A better environment starts with us."

Temperature records falling
By Frank Bosse and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
(Translated/edited by P Gosselin)
The global February temperature reported by GISS is 1.35°C above the 1951-1980 mean. That’s an impressive record and is 0.8°C (!) warmer than February 2014. How can such a huge jump in such a short time be explained? We presented one source last month: The Current El Niño.
But this time around we will focus on a huge area of ocean: the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP). It stretches from 90° east to 180° east, and from 20°south to 20°north, see shaded area below:

 Figure 5: The IPWP (shaded turquoise), Source: „Google Earth“
In this ocean region heated water of the tropical Pacific comes from Central and South America and is driven westwards by trade winds when normal conditions of the El Niño Southern Oscillation prevail (ENSO), or even under La Niña conditions. We have clearly explained this here. The highest sea surface temperatures occur here in the marked region shown in Figure 5 and is stable at approx. 28.5°C. The heat that originates from the entire tropical Pacific gets transported down to 500 m deep into the water. The temperatures down to these depths have behaved as follows since 2004:

Figure 6: The vertical temperature distribution of the IPWP (dbar= meters water depth). The chart was generated by Argo Global Marine Atlas.
Clear to see are: the smaller El Niños 2004/2005 (blue = cooler), the La Niña of 2008 providing for a warmer IPWP, the 2009/2010 El Niño providing for a short cooling, and the 2011-2012 La Niña bringing surface warming of the water once again.
Since 2014 we have seen a very pronounced cooling over the entire depth. For our consideration of the current global warming pulse, we limit our focus to the period after 2013.

Figure 7: The temperature curve of the IPWP down to 500 m depth (blue) since 2013 and the GISS global temperature (red) until December 2015. (Data source: GISS, Argo).
The mean temperature of the IPWP has fallen 1°C since spring 2013. The current temperature has never been this cool since ARGO measurements started in 2004. Here we are describing a water amount of approximately 16 million cubic KILOMETERS, taking the share of land into consideration in the IPWP! Here a quantity of energy is released that is equivalent to 4 days of sunshine over the entire planet. This energy increases the global surface temperature and leads to an increased outward radiation of a large part of the heat into outer space. Ultimately an El Niño results in heat being extracted from the Earth system.
This means that the warming that we are currently seeing is in fact a picture of this naturally occurring process which is now underway. The current record warmth has much more to do with the natural ENSO cycles than it does with the very modest global warming that is suspected to be about 0.01°C/year from greenhouse gases.

US Attorneys General take aim at climate science dissidents
So vulnerable, flawed, and under fire has climate science and other fields become that the only tactic left to defend the disintegrating positions is to use Stalinist measures to suppress dissident views, and even sicking state attorneys general on anyone expressing legitimate doubt – science truth by state legal decree. Also read here.

Criticizing the mainstream is highly risky: Young scientists forced to conform to established models to avoid putting careers at risk
By Dr. Sebastian Lüning and Prof. Fritz Vahrenholt
In Weltwoche of 6 April 2016 Prof. Mathias Binswanger was very clear on why young university researchers are quasi forced to submit themselves to the trends of the day, i.e. the overriding mainstream in any particular scientific field:
Mathias Binswanger: ‘The principle is ultimately always the same: Foremost one has to be an often published and often cited figure in his/her scientific field in order to be able to contribute to the ranking of a university. But how does one often publish or become often cited in respected journals of his own field? The most important principles are: Adaptation to the mainstream and do not question any established theories or models. All submitted articles first must go through a peer-review process where champions of the scientific discipline evaluate it. Under these circumstances a young researcher has no option but to go along with the mainstream theories represented in the top journals and to use the empirical processes that are currently in trend. Only in this way does he/she have any chance of having enough publications to make him/herself eligible to be a professor. Through this very kind of pressure to conform applied by top journals is science obstructed rather than promoted.'”

It is hardly necessary to mention that this principle promotes a “Stalinist conformity” with the highly politicized climate sciences for young researchers. typically today mostly only retired professors dare to speak up when it comes to doubt over the supposed imminent climate catastrophe. These professors finally beco0me free to openly express themselves without threats to their careers threatened.

"The small Pacific archipelago of Palau has a poaching problem. Vietnamese crews fishing for tuna, sea cucumbers and even sharks, in timber-hulled “blue boats” are regularly apprehended in local waters. The Palauan authorities escort some of these crew out to the country’s maritime boundary, while burning their boats. But such fishermen are often trafficked and are held with no communication with loved ones at home. This method of repatriating Vietnamese crews is standard practice. Since 2014, numerous crews have had their boats sunk and been repatriated in this way. Palau is a sovereign state with a UN vote, albeit one with just 18,000 residents. In 2015 the country designated 80% of its territorial waters – an area roughly the size of Spain – as a National Marine Sanctuary. In the “Bul”, as the sanctuary is known locally, commercial fishing is off limits. The reserve has attracted many of the world’s largest conservation and development NGOs. It has received more than US$90m in pledges, mostly from corporate donors, charitable trusts and government agencies in Australia, Japan and the US.  Yet the scientific rationale behind the sanctuary is questionable. Consider Palau’s coral reefs, which are among the most biodiverse places in the entire ocean and remain the ultimate symbol of the region’s pristine waters. They are the key lure for “high-end” sports-fishers, divers and yachters to the islands and, thanks to the sanctuary, many more are expected. The reefs feature heavily in promotional materials and strategic plans for the marine reserve. Yet around most of Palau the “no take” sanctuary doesn’t actually take effect until at least 50 nautical miles from the coast, past a zone reserved for domestic fishermen (intended to shift them away from inshore reefs) which stretches out to 200 miles from the coast in some directions.  This means the sanctuary itself is too far from shore to incorporate any of the country’s fragile coral reefs, while the lack of any new restrictions on domestic fishing represents a policy failing. Access to the reefs is already regulated through various other pieces of legislation but, unlike the sanctuary, those other regulations are not designed to promote tourism. Palau’s conservation efforts are part of a vision to become a tourist destination for the super-rich. New laws and tax incentives mean only five-star hotels will get planning approval in future while the country’s famous Rock Islands, a UNESCO World Heritage site, will likely prove out of bounds to anyone without a private yacht. A significant airport expansion plan, managed by the Japanese, will likely see the overall number of tourists increase substantially. This begs the question of what the sanctuary is for. If it is in place to protect the reef, then it isn’t doing a very good job as it doesn’t cover the right area. If it is there to protect the offshore environment, then instead of using it to boost tourism, Palau should also limit the numbers of international arrivals who largely go sport fishing further offshore. Out to sea, Palau is planning to develop the often uninhabited outcrop of Helen Reef, 350 miles south of Palau’s main islands, ostensibly for monitoring and surveillance. But in addition to a dock, fuel depot and rangers station, Palau’s project leaders say potential expansion could include tourist development, including a  dive resort complex. Japanese NGOs, the Nippon Foundation and the Sasakawa Peace Foundation have also contributed to Palau’s coastguard, and the latter recently donated a new 40-metre patrol vessel, the PSS Kedam and has previously helped Palau survey the area.  Waters surrounding Helen Reef are contested with neighbouring Indonesia. The geopolitical implications of this are still unclear, though it is likely that Japan has a significant interest in the sanctuary acting as a buffer to Chinese expansion in the region. Palau’s president, meanwhile, has stated that the marine sanctuary is “not just a conservation policy; it is also a national security policy”. Bearing in mind this latter motivation, the president has sponsored a plan to adopt similar conservation enclosures around at least 30% of the world’s oceans. This position is no longer radical – it’s the mainstream. Since 2006, seven Pacific island nations have designated huge swathes of their oceans as protected areas. Michelle Grady, from the Pew Charitable Trust, recently suggested the 30% target “had the status of expert advice, much like the science underpinning the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change”. But such bold targets can serve to promote heavy-handed, perhaps even violent conservation. Unless consumption is reined in at home, and the drivers of poverty and slavery are tackled out to sea, few will benefit except the super-rich in search of paradise. This article was amended on November 1 to remove reference to unpublished data that was incorrectly used in this article. A change was also made to clarify the distance of the marine sanctuary from any coral reefs, and a subheading rewritten to avoid implying that Palau’s coral reefs are not protected by any legislation."
