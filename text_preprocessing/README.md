Original dataset is on Kaggle -> https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news?select=articles2.csv

I normalised it in order to fit our column description: url, author, title, source, text, date, tags

Most articles don't have tags or urls

Dataset only has 1000 rows because the original dataset was too large to upload (50K rows)
